BACKGROUND: Rice callus suspension culture (RCSC) has been shown to exhibit
potent antiproliferative activity in multiple cancer cell lines. RCSC and its
bioactive compounds can fill the need for drugs with no side effects.
HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: The anti-inflammatory potential of RCSC and its bioactive
fractions on normal colon epithelial cell lines, was investigated.
STUDY DESIGN: Three cell lines, InEpC, NCM356 and CCD841-CoN were treated with
proinflammatory cytokines followed by RCSC. Cytoplasmic and nuclear ROS were
assayed with fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometer. Expression analysis of
immune-related genes was performed in RCSC-treated cell lines. RCSC was
fractionated using column chromatography and HPLC. Pooled fractions 10-18 was
used to test for antiproliferative activity using colon adenocarcinoma cell line,
SW620 and anti-inflammatory activity using CCD841-CoN. Mass spectrometric
analysis was performed to identify candidate compounds in four fractions.
RESULTS: RCSC treatment showed differential effects with higher cytoplasmic ROS
levels in NCM356 and CCD841-CoN and lower ROS levels in InEpC. Nuclear generated 
ROS levels increased in all three treated cell lines. Flow cytometry analysis of 
propidium iodide stained cells indicated mitigation of cell death caused by
inflammation in RCSC treated groups in both NCM356 and CCD841-CoN. Genes encoding
transcription factors and cytokines were differentially regulated in NCM356 and
CCD841-CoN cell lines treated with RCSC which provided insights into possible
pathways. Analysis of pooled fractions 10-18 by HPLC identified 8 peaks. Cell
viability assay with fractions 10-18 using SW620 showed that the number of viable
cells were greatly reduced which was similar to 6X and 33X RCSC with very little 
effect on normal cells which similar to 1X RCSC. RCSC fractions increased nuclear
and cytoplasmic ROS vs. both untreated and inflammatory control. Analysis of four
fractions by mass spectrometry identified 4-deoxyphloridzin, 5'-methoxycurcumin, 
piceid and lupeol as candidate compounds which are likely to be responsible for
the antiproliferative, anti-inflammatory and immune-regulating properties of
RCSC.
CONCLUSION: RCSC and its fractions showed anti-inflammatory activity on inflamed 
colon epithelial cells. Downstream target candidate genes which are likely to
mediate RCSC effects were identified. Candidate compounds responsible for the
antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory activity of RCSC and its fractions
provide possible drug targets.

Background: Both environmental and genetic factors have been implicated in the
induction of autoimmune disease. Therefore, it is important to understand the
pathophysiological significance of the gut microbiota and host genetic background
that contribute to an autoimmune disease such as inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD). We have previously reported that mice deficient for suppressor of cytokine
signaling-1 (SOCS1), in which SOCS1 expression was restored in T and B cells on
an SOCS1-/- background (SOCS1-/-Tg mice), developed systemic autoimmune diseases 
accompanied by spontaneous colitis.
Methods: To investigate whether the proinflammatory genetic background affects
the gut microbiota, we used SOCS1-/-Tg mice as a model of spontaneous chronic
colitis. Fecal samples were collected from SOCS1-/-Tg mice and SOCS1+/+Tg
(control) mice at 1 and 6 months of age, and the fecal bacterial 16S ribosomal
RNA genes were sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform.
Results: Gut microbial diversity was significantly reduced and the intestinal
bacterial community composition changed in SOCS1-/-Tg mice in comparison with the
control mice. Interestingly, the population of Prevotella species, which is known
to be elevated in ulcerative colitis and colorectal cancer patients, was
significantly increased in SOCS1-/-Tg mice regardless of age.
Conclusion: Taken together, these results suggest that the proinflammatory
genetic background owing to SOCS1 deficiency causes dysbiosis of the gut
microbiota, which in turn generates a procolitogenic environment.

BACKGROUND: Cholangiocarcinomas are a heterogeneous group of malignancies arising
from a number of cells of origin along the biliary tree. Although most cases in
Western countries are sporadic, large population-based studies have identified a 
number of risk factors. This review summarises the evidence behind reported risk 
factors and current understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of
cholangiocarcinoma, with a focus on inflammation and cholestasis as the driving
forces in cholangiocarcinoma development.
RISK FACTORS FOR CHOLANGIOCARCINOGENESIS: Cholestatic liver diseases (e.g.
primary sclerosing cholangitis and fibropolycystic liver diseases), liver
cirrhosis, and biliary stone disease all increase the risk of cholangiocarcinoma.
Certain bacterial, viral or parasitic infections such as hepatitis B and C and
liver flukes also increase cholangiocarcinoma risk. Other risk factors include
inflammatory disorders (such as inflammatory bowel disease and chronic
pancreatitis), toxins (e.g. alcohol and tobacco), metabolic conditions (diabetes,
obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) and a number of genetic disorders.
MOLECULAR PATHOGENESIS OF CHOLANGIOCARCINOMA: Regardless of aetiology, most risk 
factors cause chronic inflammation or cholestasis. Chronic inflammation leads to 
increased exposure of cholangiocytes to the inflammatory mediators interleukin-6,
Tumour Necrosis Factor-ɑ, Cyclo-oxygenase-2 and Wnt, resulting in progressive
mutations in tumour suppressor genes, proto-oncogenes and DNA mismatch-repair
genes. Accumulating bile acids from cholestasis lead to reduced pH, increased
apoptosis and activation of ERK1/2, Akt and NF-κB pathways that encourage cell
proliferation, migration and survival. Other mediators upregulated in
cholangiocarcinoma include Transforming Growth Factor-β, Vascular Endothelial
Growth Factor, Hepatocyte Growth Factor and several microRNAs. Increased
expression of the cell surface receptor c-Met, the glucose transporter GLUT-1 and
the sodium iodide symporter lead to tumour growth, angiogenesis and cell
migration. Stromal changes are also observed, resulting in alterations to the
extracellular matrix composition and recruitment of fibroblasts and macrophages
that create a microenvironment promoting cell survival, invasion and metastasis.
CONCLUSION: Regardless of aetiology, most risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma
cause chronic inflammation and/or cholestasis, leading to the activation of
common intracellular pathways that result in reactive cell proliferation,
genetic/epigenetic mutations and cholangiocarcinogenesis. An understanding of the
molecular pathogenesis of cholangiocarcinoma is vital when developing new
diagnostic biomarkers and targeted therapies for this disease.

The mucosal surface of the intestinal tract represents a major entry route for
many microbes. Despite recent progress in the understanding of the IL-21/IL-21R
signaling axis in the generation of germinal center B cells, the roles played by 
this signaling pathway in the context of enteric microbial infections is not
well-understood. Here, we demonstrate that Il21r-/- mice are more susceptible to 
colonic microbial infection, and in the process discovered that the IL-21/IL-21R 
signaling axis surprisingly collaborate with the IFN-γ/IFN-γR signaling pathway
to enhance the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) required for
protection, via amplifying activation of STAT1 in mucosal CD4+ T cells in a
murine model of Citrobacter rodentium colitis. As expected, conditional deletion 
of STAT3 in CD4+ T cells indicated that STAT3 also contributed importantly to
host defense against C. rodentium infection in the colon. However, the
collaboration between IL-21 and IFN-γ to enhance the phosphorylation of STAT1 and
upregulate ISGs was independent of STAT3. Unveiling this previously unreported
crosstalk between these two cytokine networks and their downstream genes induced 
will provide insight into the development of novel therapeutic targets for
colonic infections, inflammatory bowel disease, and promotion of mucosal vaccine 
efficacy.

A role of sphingolipids for inflammatory bowel disease and cancer is evident.
However, the relative and separate contribution of sphingolipid deterioration in 
inflammation versus carcinogenesis for the pathophysiology of colitis-associated 
colon cancer (CAC) was unknown and therefore examined in this study. We performed
isogenic bone marrow transplantation of inducible sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)
lyase knockout mice to specifically modulate sphingolipids and associated genes
and proteins in a compartment-specific way in a DSS/AOM mediated CAC model. 3D
organoid cultures were used in vitro. S1P lyase (SGPL1) knockout in either immune
cells or tissue, caused local sphingolipid accumulation leading to a dichotomic
development of CAC: Immune cell SGPL1 knockout (I-SGPL-/-) augmented massive
immune cell infiltration initiating colitis with lesions and calprotectin
increase. Pathological crypt remodeling plus extracellular S1P-signaling caused
delayed tumor formation characterized by S1P receptor 1, STAT3 mRNA increase, as 
well as programmed cell death ligand 1 expression, accompanied by a putatively
counter regulatory STAT1S727 phosphorylation. In contrast, tissue SGPL1 knockout 
(T-SGPL-/-) provoked immediate occurrence of epithelial-driven tumors with
upregulated sphingosine kinase 1, S1P receptor 2 and epidermal growth factor
receptor. Here, progressing carcinogenesis was accompanied by an IL-12 to IL-23
shift with a consecutive development of a Th2/GATA3-driven, tumor-favoring
microenvironment. Moreover, the knockout models showed distinct lymphopenia and
neutrophilia, different from the full SGPL1 knockout. This study shows that
depending on the initiating cellular S1P source, the pathophysiology of
inflammation-induced cancer versus cancer-induced inflammation develops through
separate, discernible molecular steps.

The human gut relies on several cellular and molecular mechanisms to allow for an
intact and dynamical intestinal barrier. Normally, only small amounts of luminal 
content pass the mucosa, however, if the control is broken it can lead to
enhanced passage, which might damage the mucosa, leading to pathological
conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It is well established that
genetic, environmental, and immunological factors all contribute in the
pathogenesis of IBD, and a disturbed intestinal barrier function has become a
hallmark of the disease. Genetical studies support the involvement of intestinal 
barrier as several susceptibility genes for IBD encode proteins with key
functions in gut barrier and homeostasis. IBD patients are associated with loss
in bacterial diversity and shifts in the microbiota, with a possible link to
local inflammation. Furthermore, alterations of immune cells and several
neuro-immune signaling pathways in the lamina propria have been demonstrated. An 
inappropriate immune activation might lead to mucosal inflammation, with elevated
secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines that can affect the epithelium and
promote a leakier barrier. This review will focus on the main cells and molecular
mechanisms in IBD and how these can be targeted in order to improve intestinal
barrier function and reduce inflammation.

BACKGROUND: Anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is used for the treatment of
severe cases of IBD, including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). 
However, one-third of the patients do not respond to the treatment. We have
previously investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes
involved in inflammation were associated with response to anti-TNF therapy among 
patients with CD or UC.
AIM: A new cohort of patients was established for replication of the previous
findings and to identify new SNPs associated with anti-TNF response.
METHODS: Fifty-three SNPs assessed previously in cohort 1 (482 CD and 256 UC
patients) were genotyped in cohort 2 (587 CD and 458 UC patients). The results
were analysed using logistic regression (adjusted for age and gender).
RESULTS: Ten SNPs were associated with anti-TNF response either among patients
with CD (TNFRSF1A(rs4149570) (OR: 1.92, 95% CI: 1.02-3.60, P = 0.04),
IL18(rs187238) (OR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.00-1.82, P = 0.05), and JAK2(rs12343867) (OR:
1.35, 95% CI: 1.02-1.78, P = 0.03)), UC (TLR2(rs11938228) (OR: 0.55, 95% CI:
0.33-0.92, P = 0.02), TLR4(rs5030728) (OR: 2.23, 95% CI: 1.24-4.01, P = 0.01) and
(rs1554973) (OR: 0.49, 95% CI: 0.27-0.90, P = 0.02), NFKBIA(rs696) (OR: 1.45, 95%
CI: 1.06-2.00, P = 0.02), and NLRP3(rs4612666) (OR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.44-0.91,
P = 0.01)) or in the combined cohort of patient with CD and UC (IBD)
(TLR4(rs5030728) (OR: 1.46, 95% CI: 1.01-2.11, P = 0.04) and (rs1554973)(OR:
0.80, 95% CI: 0.65-0.98, P = 0.03), NFKBIA(rs696) (OR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.01-1.54,
P = 0.04), NLRP3(rs4612666) (OR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.57-0.95, P = 0.02),
IL1RN(rs4251961) (OR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.66-1.00, P = 0.05), IL18(rs1946518) (OR:
1.24, 95% CI: 1.01-1.53, P = 0.04), and JAK2(rs12343867) (OR: 1.24, 95% CI:
1.01-1.53, P = 0.04)).
CONCLUSIONS: The results support that polymorphisms in genes involved in the
regulation of the NFκB pathway (TLR2, TLR4, and NFKBIA), the TNF-α signalling
pathway (TNFRSF1A), and other cytokine pathways (NLRP3, IL1RN, IL18, and JAK2)
were associated with response to anti-TNF therapy. Our multi-SNP model predicted 
response rate of more than 82% (in 9% of the CD patients) and 75% (in 15% of the 
UC patients), compared to 71% and 64% in all CD and UC patients, respectively.
More studies are warranted to predict response for use in the clinic.

Disruption of mucosal structure and barrier function contribute to the
pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Efficacy of therapy in IBD is
based on endoscopic mucosal healing, which occurs by a dynamic interplay of
epithelial cell regeneration, migration and differentiation. Both mesalamine
(5-ASA) and azathioprine (AZTP) promote this process through mechanisms not
clearly understood. We examined molecular pathways implicated in epithelial
barrier function that were altered by 5-ASA and AZTP. Paracellular permeability
induced by inflammatory mediators was mitigated by both compounds through
restoration of cellular anchoring complexes. 5-ASA and AZTP induced rearrangement
and membranous localization of junctional proteins and modulated genes involved
in tight junctions. Intestinal organoids from wildtype-mice treated with TNF-α
and IL-10- deficient-mice displayed impaired epithelial barrier with loss of
membranous E-cadherin and reduced Desmoglein-2 expression. These effects were
counteracted by 5-ASA and AZTP. Unlike AZTP that exhibited antiproliferative
effects, 5-ASA promoted wound healing in colon epithelial cells. Both affected
cellular senescence, cell cycle distribution and restricted cells in G1 or S
phase without inducing apoptosis. This study provides mechanistic evidence that
molecular actions of 5-ASA and AZTP on intestinal epithelia are fundamental in
the resolution of barrier dysfunction.

Nuclear receptors (NRs) are ligand-dependent transcription factors that regulate 
the transcription of target genes. Previous epidemiological and genetic studies
have documented the association of NRs with the risk of inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD). Although the mechanisms of action of NRs in IBD have not been
fully established, accumulating evidence has demonstrated that NRs play
complicated roles in regulating intestinal immunity, mucosal barriers, and
intestinal flora. As one of the first-line medications for the treatment of IBD, 
5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) activates peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor gamma (PPARγ) to attenuate colitis. The protective roles of rifaximin
and rifampicin partly depend on promoting pregnane X receptor (PXR) expression.
The aims of this review are to discuss the roles of several important NRs, such
as PPARγ, PXR, vitamin D receptor (VDR), farnesoid X receptor (FXR), and
RAR-related orphan receptor gammat (RORγt), in the pathogenesis of IBD and
management strategies based on targeting these receptors.

Although genetic approaches are the standard in microbiome analysis,
proteome-level information is largely absent. This discrepancy warrants a better 
understanding of the relationship between gene copy number and protein abundance,
as this is crucial information for inferring protein-level changes from
metagenomic data. As it remains unknown how metaproteomic systems evolve during
dynamic disease states, we leveraged a 4.5-year fecal time series using samples
from a single patient with colonic Crohn's disease. Utilizing multiplexed
quantitative proteomics and shotgun metagenomic sequencing of eight time points
in technical triplicate, we quantified over 29,000 protein groups and 110,000
genes and compared them to five protein biomarkers of disease activity.
Broad-scale observations were consistent between data types, including overall
clustering by principal-coordinate analysis and fluctuations in Gene Ontology
terms related to Crohn's disease. Through linear regression, we determined genes 
and proteins fluctuating in conjunction with inflammatory metrics. We discovered 
conserved taxonomic differences relevant to Crohn's disease, including a negative
association of Faecalibacterium and a positive association of Escherichia with
calprotectin. Despite concordant associations of genera, the specific genes
correlated with these metrics were drastically different between metagenomic and 
metaproteomic data sets. This resulted in the generation of unique functional
interpretations dependent on the data type, with metaproteome evidence for
previously investigated mechanisms of dysbiosis. An example of one such mechanism
was a connection between urease enzymes, amino acid metabolism, and the local
inflammation state within the patient. This proof-of-concept approach prompts
further investigation of the metaproteome and its relationship with the
metagenome in biologically complex systems such as the microbiome. IMPORTANCE A
majority of current microbiome research relies heavily on DNA analysis. However, 
as the field moves toward understanding the microbial functions related to
healthy and disease states, it is critical to evaluate how changes in DNA relate 
to changes in proteins, which are functional units of the genome. This study
tracked the abundance of genes and proteins as they fluctuated during various
inflammatory states in a 4.5-year study of a patient with colonic Crohn's
disease. Our results indicate that despite a low level of correlation, taxonomic 
associations were consistent in the two data types. While there was overlap of
the data types, several associations were uniquely discovered by analyzing the
metaproteome component. This case study provides unique and important insights
into the fundamental relationship between the genes and proteins of a single
individual's fecal microbiome associated with clinical consequences.

Crohn's disease (CD) is a debilitating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that
arises from chronic inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. Genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) have identified over 200 single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with a predisposition for developing
IBD. For the majority, the causal variant and target genes affected are unknown. 
Here, we investigated the CD-associated SNP rs6651252 that maps to a gene desert 
region on chromosome 8. We demonstrate that rs6651252 resides within a Wnt
responsive DNA enhancer element (WRE) and that the disease associated allele
augments binding of the TCF7L2 transcription factor to this region. Using
CRISPR/Cas9 directed gene editing and epigenetic modulation, we find that the
rs6651252 enhancer regulates expression of the c-MYC proto-oncogene (MYC).
Furthermore, we found MYC transcript levels are elevated in patient-derived
colonic segments harboring the disease-associated allele in comparison to those
containing the ancestral allele. These results suggest that Wnt/MYC signaling
contributes to CD pathogenesis and that patients harboring the disease-associated
allele may benefit from therapies that target MYC or MYC-regulated genes.

BACKGROUND: Carcinogenesis is a severe consequence of chronic ulcerative colitis.
We investigated the somatic mutations and pathway alterations in ulcerative
colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CRC) in Chinese patients compared with
sporadic CRCs to reveal potential therapeutic targets in ulcerative
colitis-associated CRC.
METHODS: Whole exome sequencing was performed on archival tumor tissues and
paired adjacent nondysplastic mucosa from 10 ulcerative colitis-associated CRC
patients at a high risk of carcinogenesis. Genomic alteration profiles from 223
primary CRCs from The Cancer Genome Atlas served as sporadic CRC controls. A
meta-analysis was performed to investigate differences in major genetic mutations
between ulcerative colitis-associated and Crohn's disease-associated CRCs.
RESULTS: We identified 44 nonsilent recurrent somatic mutations via whole exome
sequencing, including 25 deleterious mutations involved in apoptosis and the
PI3K-Akt pathway (COL6A3, FN1), autophagy (ULK1), cell adhesion (PODXL, PTPRT,
ZFHX4), and epigenetic regulation (ARID1A, NCOR2, KMT2D, NCOA6, MECP2, SUPT6H).
In total, 11 of the 25 mutated genes significantly differed between ulcerative
colitis-associated CRC and sporadic CRC (APC, APOB, MECP2, NCOR2, NTRK2, PODXL,
RABGAP1, SIK3, SUPT6H, ULK1, USP48). Somatic TP53 mutations occurred in 33% of
ulcerative colitis-associated CRCs. Subsequent meta-analysis revealed distinct
mutation profiles for Crohn's disease- and ulcerative colitis-associated CRCs.
Mutations involving the NF-kB pathway and epigenetic regulation were more common 
in ulcerative colitis-associated CRCs than in sporadic CRCs.
CONCLUSION: Distinct genomic alteration profiles of deleterious somatic mutations
were found in ulcerative colitis-associated and sporadic CRCs. Mutations of
epigenetic regulators, such as KMT2D and NCOA6, were common, suggesting an
epigenetic pathomechanism for colitis-associated carcinoma in Chinese patients.

BACKGROUND: Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) responding to anti-tumor necrosis 
factor (anti-TNF) show great variability in serum drug levels, even within the
therapeutic range. We aimed at exploring the role of inflammatory, genetic, and
bacterial variables in relation to anti-TNF through levels in CD patients.
METHODS: Consecutive CD patients receiving stable doses of infliximab or
adalimumab were included. Clinical and analytical parameters were recorded.
Cytokine response, bacterial DNA translocation, and several immune-related genes'
genotypes were evaluated, along with serum through anti-TNF drug levels. A linear
regression analysis controlled by weight and drug regimen was performed.
RESULTS: One hundred nineteen patients were initially considered. Five patients
on infliximab and 2 on adalimumab showed antidrug antibodies in serum and were
excluded. One hundred twelve patients were finally included (62 on infliximab, 50
on adalimumab). Fourteen patients on infliximab and 15 on adalimumab (22.6% vs
30%, P = 0.37) were receiving an intensified drug regimen. C-reactive protein
(CRP), fecal calprotectin, Crohn's Disease Activity Index, leukocyte count, and
albumin levels in plasma were not significantly associated with infliximab or
adalimumab levels in the multivariate analysis. Serum interleukin-10 (IL-10)
levels were directly related to infliximab (Beta = 0.097, P < 0.0001) and
adalimumab levels (Beta = 0.069, P = 0.0241). The best multivariate regression
model explaining the variability of serum infliximab and adalimumab levels
included IL-10. Predicted drug levels by this model robustly fitted with actual
drug levels (R2 = 0.841 for infliximab, R2 = 0.733 for adalimumab).
CONCLUSION: Serum IL-10 is significantly related to serum anti-TNF levels in CD
patients, showing how the disposition of anti-TNF drugs is significantly
influenced by the degree of immunological activation.

Aim: Aim of this study was to compare the gene expression of Interleukin 12
members in two phase of IBD.
Background: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a well-known gastrointestinal
disorder in the world that fluctuates between remission and flare-up phases. Each
of these phases has an individual immune system response profile. Therefore,
analyzing the interleukins (IL) expression status improves the diagnosis and the 
classification of the IBD cases.
Methods: In this a case-control study, among 400 patients whom admitted to the
IBD clinic, forty nine IBD patients were included. Patients were divided into
three categories based on 1) the phase of the disease, 2) the type of IBD,
Ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD), and 3) the therapeutic pathways.
Using the real-time PCR method, the expression levels of IL-12A, IL-12B, IL-23A, 
and IL-27 were examined in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) and
compared to the pre-described subgroups.
Results: the data showed upregulation in the expression levels of IL-12A and
IL-12B in the remission phase in comparison with the flare-up. However, no
significant changes were obtained from the evaluation of IL-23A and IL-27. In
addition, the mRNA levels of the target genes in the subgroups of Category 2 as
well as Category 3 were similar.
Conclusion: Our results showed that expression patterns of the IL-12A and IL-12B 
genes varied between the remission and flare-up phases for the IBD patients, and 
may be considered as potential biomarkers for the detection and the
classification of IBD cases.

The intestinal mucosa is a site of multiple stressors and forms the barrier
between the internal and external environment. In the intestine, a complex
interplay between the microbiota, epithelial barrier and the local immune system 
maintains homeostasis and promotes a healthy gut. One of the major cellular
catabolic processes that regulate this homeostasis is autophagy. Autophagy is
required to maintain anti-microbial defense, epithelial barrier integrity and
mucosal immune response. Dysregulation of the autophagy process causes disruption
of several aspects of the intestinal epithelium and the immune system that can
lead to an inappropriate immune response and subsequent inflammation. Genome-wide
association studies have found an association between several risk loci in
autophagy genes and inflammatory bowel disease. The aim of the current review is 
to provide an update on the role of autophagy in intestinal mucosal physiology
and in the control of inappropriate inflammation.

Neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL), also known as Lipocalin 2, is 
an antimicrobial protein, encoded by the gene LCN2, strongly upregulated in
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and a promising biomarker for IBD. Here we
demonstrate that NGAL is highly expressed in all parts of pyloric metaplasia,
also known as the ulcer-associated cell lineage (UACL), a metaplastic cell
lineage suggested to play a role in wound healing in Crohn's disease (CD). We
further show NGAL expression in regenerative intestinal crypts and in
undifferentiated patient-derived colonoids. This indicates that NGAL is important
in the tissue regeneration process. The remarkable overexpression of NGAL in UACL
led us to explore the pathobiology of these cells by transcriptome-wide RNA
sequencing. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to characterize the UACL
at this level. Biopsies with UACL and inflamed non-UACL epithelium from the
terminal ileum of CD patients and epithelium from healthy controls were laser
capture microdissected for RNA sequencing. Among the 180 genes differentially
expressed between UACL and control epithelium, the ten most-upregulated genes
specific for UACL were MUC5AC, PGC, MUC6, MUC5B, LCN2, POU2AF1, MUC1, SDC3,
IGFBP5 and SLC7A5. PDX1 was among the most upregulated in both UACL and inflamed 
non-UACL epithelium. Immunohistochemistry and iDisco 3D visualization was used to
characterize UACL histo-morphologically, and to validate protein expression of 11
selected differentially expressed genes. Among these genes, LCN2, NOTCH2, PHLDA1,
IGFBP5, SDC3, BPIFB1 and RCN1 have previously not been linked to UACL. Gene
expression results were analyzed for functional implications using MetaCore,
showing that differentially expressed genes are enriched for genes involved in
cell migration and motility, and for biomarkers of gastrointestinal neoplasia.
These results support a role for UACL as part of the re-epithelialization process
during and after destructive intestinal inflammation.

It is well recognized that the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated
with an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). More susceptibility IBD genes 
have been reported, NOD2 being one of the most extensively investigated. The aim 
of this study was to evaluate a possible correlation between NOD2 rs2066844 C>T
(also known as Arg702Trp or R702W) variant and CRC risk in a Romanian population.
A total of 373 Romanian subjects (108 patients diagnosed with sporadic CRC and
265 controls) were enrolled in this hospital-based case-control study. The NOD2
R702W variants were detected by Real-time PCR using a predesigned TaqMan
Genotyping Assay. The association between the genetic risk variant and CRC was
expressed as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We did not find
any statistically significant difference when we compared CC genotype with CT
genotype (OR 1.1, 95% CI: 0.46-2.61; p=0.83) between CRC patients and controls.
No TT homozygous genotype was detected. Also, we compared allele frequencies and 
no correlation was found (OR 1.09, 95% CI: 0.47-2.56; p=0.84). No association was
found in the stratified analysis by tumor site, Dukes' stage and histological
subtype. Our study suggests that the NOD2 R702W variant is not associated with
CRC risk in the Romanian population. Further data from different and larger
populations is required to determine whether NOD R702W SNP has effects on
susceptibility to CRC.

As knowledge of the genetics behind inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has
continually improved, there has been a demand for methods that can use this data 
in a clinically significant way. Genome-wide association analyses for IBD have
identified 232 risk genetic loci for the disorder. While identification of these 
risk loci enriches our understanding of the underlying biology of the disorder,
their identification does not serve a clinical purpose. A potential use of this
genetic information is to look for potential IBD drugs that target these loci in 
a procedure known as drug repurposing. The demand for new drug treatments for IBD
is high due to the side effects and high costs of current treatments. We
hypothesize that IBD genetic variants obtained from GWAS and the candidate genes 
prioritized from the variants have a causal relationship with IBD drug targets. A
computational drug repositioning study was done due to its efficiency and
inexpensiveness compared to traditional in vitro or biochemical approaches. Our
approach for drug repurposing was multi-layered; it not only focused on the
interactions between drugs and risk IBD genes, but also the interactions between 
drugs and all of the biological pathways the risk genes are involved in. We
prioritized IBD candidate genes using identified genetic variants and identified 
potential drug targets and drugs that can be potentially repositioned or
developed for IBD using the identified candidate genes. Our analysis strategy can
be applied to repurpose drugs for other complex diseases using their risk genes
identified from genetic analysis.

The Hologenome Concept of Evolution: Medical Implications.

All natural animals and plants are holobionts, consisting of the host and
microbiome, which is composed of abundant and diverse microorganisms. Health and 
disease of holobionts depend as much on interactions between host and microbiome 
and within the microbiome, as on interactions between organs and body parts of
the host. Recent evidence indicates that a significant fraction of the microbiome
is transferred by a variety of mechanisms from parent to offspring for many
generations. Genetic variation in holobionts can occur in the microbiome as well 
as in the host genome, and it occurs more rapidly and by more mechanisms in
genomes of microbiomes than in host genomes (e.g. via acquisition of novel
microbes and horizontal gene transfer of microbial genes into host chromosomes). 
Evidence discussed in this review supports the concept that holobionts with their
hologenomes can be considered levels of selection in evolution. Though changes in
the microbiome can lead to evolution of the holobiont, it can also lead to
dysbiosis and diseases (e.g. obesity, diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease, and
autism). In practice, the possibility of manipulating microbiomes offers the
potential to prevent and cure diseases.

A growing body of evidence suggests that probiotic functionality is not
accurately predicted by their taxonomy. Here, we have set up a study to
investigate the effectiveness of two probiotic formulations containing a blend of
seven bacterial species in modulating intestinal inflammation in two rodent
models of colitis, induced by treating mice with 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic
acid (TNBS) or dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Despite the taxonomy of the
bacterial species in the two probiotic formulations being similar, only one
preparation (Blend 2-Vivomixx) effectively attenuated the development of colitis 
in both models. In the TNBS model of colitis, Blend 2 reduced the expression of
pro-inflammatory genes while increasing the production of anti-inflammatory
cytokines, promoting the expansion M2 macrophages and the formation of
IL-10-producing Treg cells in the colon's lamina propria. In the DSS model of
colitis, disease attenuation and Treg formation was observed only in mice
administered with Blend 2, and this effect was associated with intestinal
microbiota remodeling and increased formation of lactate, butyrate, and
propionate. None of these effects were observed in mice administered with Blend 1
(VSL#3). In summary, we have shown that two probiotic mixtures obtained by
combining taxonomically similar species produced with different manufacturing
methods exert divergent effects in mouse models of colitis.

Insights into the Pathogenesis of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: Genetics and
Microbiota Abstract. An inadequate immune response against bacteria of the
gastrointestinal tract is the basic mechanism mediating the pathophysiology of
inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The risk of IBD is partially heritable and
approximately 12 % of patients have a family history of IBD. Large genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) were able to identify 240 genetic regions associated
with IBD. Many of the implicated genes have a function in the immune system, are 
associated with primary immunodeficiencies or the defense against mycobacteria.
Together these 240 genetic regions form an excellent framework for further
investigations into the pathogenesis and therapy of IBD. However, GWAS so far
were able to unravel only a fraction of the genetic IBD risk. New strategies like
genome wide sequencing are currently used to identify additional (rare) genetic
variants. In rare cases, IBD is also inherited as a monogenetic disease.
Moreover, there likely is significant interaction between genes and environmental
factors which can only be unraveled if both, genes and the environment are
simultaneously considered. Interestingly, the information provided by genetic
risk factors for IBD is unable to predict the clinical course of IBD. New GWAS
therefore focus on IBD prognosis and first insights have already been made. The
gastrointestinal tract harbors a huge number of microorganisms (microbiota). It
remains an enormous challenge for the immune system to contain this bacterial
load while enabling the host to benefit from the many essential contributions of 
the microbiota. In IBD, the microbiota is altered to a dysfunctional (dysbiotic) 
state showing reduced diversity and a higher amount of potential pathogenic
Proteobacteriae, such as Escherichia coli. In IBD, the microbiota is also more
dynamic in its composition over time compared to health. Further, IBD dysbiosis
is more pronounced in Crohn's disease than in ulcerative colitis. In animal
experiments, dysbiosis could be transferred by fecal microbiota transplantation
from one mouse to another, triggering inflammation in the recipient. In contrast,
a healthy microbiota can downregulate the immune response of the host, for
instance by bacterial short chain fatty acids (SCFA) synthesis. In addition, some
bacteria with close physical contact to the intestinal wall also have specific
immunosuppressive properties. So far, the highly complex network of microbiota,
genetics, immune system and environment is only partially understood. The
microbiota is a potential therapeutic target which up to now can only be
non-specifically influenced by antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics or fecal
microbiota transplantation. A better understanding of the microbiota will likely 
yield in the discovery of new therapeutic options in the future.

Publisher: Zusammenfassung. Chronisch entzündliche Darmerkrankungen (CED) sind
durch eine inadäquate Immunantwort gegen Darmbakterien bedingt. Das Risiko für
CED ist teilweise erblich und 12 % aller Patienten haben eine Familienanamnese
mit CED. In grossen Genomweiten Assoziationsstudien (GWAS) konnten zuletzt 240
mit CED assoziierte genetische Regionen gefunden werden. Viele dieser Gene haben 
eine Funktion im Immunsystem oder sind mit primären Immundefizienzen oder der
Mykobakterienabwehr assoziiert. Die 240 gefundenen genetischen Regionen sind
insgesamt ein hervorragender Arbeitsplan für weitere Forschungen bezüglich
Pathogenesemechanismen und Therapien bei CED. GWAS konnten jedoch bis jetzt nur
einen Teil des genetischen CED-Risikos aufklären. Neue Strategien wie genomweites
Sequenzieren werden deshalb angewandt, um weitere (seltene) genetische Varianten 
zu identifizieren. Zudem wird bei wenigen Patienten CED als monogenetische
Erkrankung vererbt. Hinzu kommt, dass genetische Aspekte relevant mit
Umweltfaktoren interagieren können und dann nur entdeckt werden, wenn in Studien 
die Umwelt ebenfalls berücksichtigt wird. Interessanterweise können die bis jetzt
gefundenen genetischen Varianten auch in Kombination den Krankheitsverlauf nicht 
voraussagen. Neue GWAS haben deshalb auf die Prognose der CED fokussiert und
erste neue Erkenntnisse gebracht, es besteht jedoch weiterer Forschungsbedarf.
Der Gastrointestinaltrakt beherbergt eine grosse Zahl an Mikroorganismen
(Mikrobiota) und es ist eine grosse Herausforderung für das Immunsystem, diese
unter Kontrolle zu behalten und trotzdem von den vielfältigen essentiellen
Aktivitäten der Mikrobiota zu profitieren. Bei CED findet sich eine veränderte,
dysfunktionale (dysbiotische) Mikrobiota mit verminderter Diversität und einer
vermehrten Zahl potentiell pathogener Proteobacteriae, wie z. B. Escherichia
coli. Die Mikrobiota ist bei CED in ihrer Zusammensetzung dynamischer (zeitlich
variabler) als im gesunden Zustand und Dysbiose ist bei Morbus Crohn stärker
ausgeprägt als bei Colitis ulcerosa. In Tierexperimenten konnte eine dysbiotische
Mikrobiota durch intestinale Mikrobiotatransplantation (Stuhltransplantation) auf
ein anderes Tier übertragen werden und damit eine Darmentzündung ausgelöst
werden. Eine intakte Mikrobiota führt hingegen zu vermehrter bakterieller
Produktion von kurzkettigen Fettsäuren (Short Chain Fatty Acids, SCFA), die das
Immunsystem im Darm herunterregulieren können. Ausserdem weisen einige Bakterien 
immunsupprimierende Eigenschaften auf. Die ausserordentlich komplexe Mikrobiota
und das Netzwerk aus Genetik, Immunsystem, Umwelt und Mikrobiota ist jedoch erst 
teilweise verstanden. Die Mikrobiota ist ein potentieller therapeutischer
Angriffspunkt, der momentan mit Antibiotika, Probiotika, Präbiotika und
Stuhltransplantation nur unspezifisch beeinflusst werden kann. Spezifische
Interventionsmöglichkeiten könnten hier neue therapeutische Optionen eröffnen.

The pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) reflects a balance
between mucosal injury and reparative mechanisms. Some regenerating gene (Reg)
family members have been reported to be expressed in Crohn's disease (CD) and
ulcerative colitis (UC) and to be involved as proliferative mucosal factors in
IBD. However, expression of all the REG family genes in IBD is still unclear.
Here, we analyzed expression of all the REG family genes (REG Iα, REG Iβ, REG
III, HIP/PAP, and REG IV) in biopsy specimens of UC and CD by real-time RT-PCR.
REG Iα, REG Iβ, and REG IV genes were overexpressed in CD samples. REG IV gene
was also overexpressed in UC samples. We further analyzed the expression
mechanisms of REG Iα, REG Iβ, and REG IV genes in LS-174T and HT-29 human colonic
epithelial cells. The expression of REG Iα was significantly induced by IL-6 or
IL-22, and REG Iβ was induced by IL-22. Deletion analyses revealed that three
regions (- 220~- 211, - 179~- 156, and - 146~- 130) in REG Iα and the region
(- 274~- 260) in REG Iβ promoter were responsible for the activation by
IL-22/IL-6. The promoters contain consensus transcription factor binding
sequences for MZF1, RTEF1/TEAD4, and STAT3 in REG Iα, and HLTF/FOXN2F in REG Iβ, 
respectively. The introduction of siRNA for MZF1, RTEF1/TEAD4, STAT3, and
HLTF/FOXN2F abolished the transcription of REG Iα and REG Iβ. The gene activation
mechanisms of REG Iα/REG Iβ may play a role in colon mucosal regeneration in IBD.

ABX464 is a first-in-class, clinical-stage, small molecule for oral
administration that has shown strong anti-inflammatory effects in the DSS-model
for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and also prevents replication of the HIV
virus. ABX464 which binds to cap binding complex (CBC) has demonstrated safety
and efficacy in a phase 2a proof-of-concept clinical trial in patients with
Ulcerative colitis. Previously, with limited technologies, it was not possible to
quantify the effect of ABX464 on viral and cellular RNA biogenesis. Here, using
RNA CaptureSeq and deep sequencing, we report that ABX464 enhances the splicing
of HIV RNA in infected PBMCs from six healthy individuals and also the expression
and splicing of a single long noncoding RNA to generate the anti-inflammatory
miR-124 both ex vivo and in HIV patients. While ABX464 has no effect on pre-mRNA 
splicing of cellular genes, depletion of CBC complex by RNAi leads to
accumulation of intron retention transcripts. These results imply that ABX464 did
not inhibit the function of CBC in splicing but rather strengthens it under
pathological condition like inflammation and HIV infection. The specific dual
ability of ABX464 to generate both anti-inflammatory miR-124 and spliced viral
RNA may have applicability for the treatment of both inflammatory diseases and
HIV infection.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis 
are devastating chronic immunopathologies of the intestinal mucosa, which are
frequently treated by immunosuppressive glucocorticoids. Endogenous
glucocorticoids are not only produced by the adrenal glands, but also by the
intestinal epithelium. Local glucocorticoid synthesis critically contributes to
the immune homeostasis of the intestinal mucosa. As defective intestinal
glucocorticoid synthesis has been associated with the development of IBD, we
investigated the expression of steroidogenic enzymes and the key transcriptional 
regulator Liver Receptor Homolog-1 (LRH-1/NR5A2) in ileal and colonic biopsies
human pediatric IBD and control patients. Furthermore, the induction of
steroidogenic enzymes and their transcriptional regulation by LRH-1 was
investigated in a mouse model of experimental colitis. These analyses revealed
that colitis-induced expression of steroidogenic enzymes in the murine colon is
dependent on the presence of LRH-1, as intestinal deletion of LRH-1 strongly
reduced their colitis-induced expression. Similarly, a strong correlation between
the expression of LRH-1 and different steroidogenic enzymes was seen in
intestinal biopsies of human pediatric patients. Importantly, reduced expression 
of hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 11B1 (HSD11B1) was observed in IBD patients
compared to control patients, suggesting that defective local reactivation of
glucocorticoids could contribute to the pathogenesis of IBD.

BACKGROUND: With the changed therapeutic armamentarium for Crohn's disease (CD)
and ulcerative colitis (UC), biomarkers predicting treatment response are
urgently needed. We studied whole blood and mucosal expression of genes
previously reported to predict outcome to anti-TNF therapy, and investigated if
the signature was specific for anti-TNF agents.
METHODS: We prospectively included 54 active IBD patients (24CD, 30UC) initiating
anti-TNF therapy, as well as 22 CD patients initiating ustekinumab and 51
patients initiating vedolizumab (25CD, 26UC). Whole blood expression of OSM,
TREM1, TNF and TNFR2 was measured prior to start of therapy using qPCR, and
mucosal gene expression in inflamed biopsies using RNA-sequencing. Response was
defined as endoscopic remission (SES-CD ≤ 2 at week 24 for CD and Mayo endoscopic
sub-score ≤ 1 at week 10 for UC).
FINDINGS: Baseline whole blood TREM1 was downregulated in future anti-TNF
responders, both in UC (FC = 0.53, p = .001) and CD (FC = 0.66, p = .007), as
well as in the complete cohort (FC = 0.67, p < .001). Receiver operator
characteristic statistics showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.78
(p = .001). A similar accuracy could be achieved with mucosal TREM1 (AUC 0.77,
p = .003), which outperformed the accuracy of serum TREM1 (AUC 0.58, p = .31).
Although differentially expressed in tissue, OSM, TNF and TNFR2 were not
differentially expressed in whole blood. The TREM1 predictive signal was anti-TNF
specific, as no changes were seen in ustekinumab and vedolizumab treated
patients.
INTERPRETATION: We identified low TREM-1 as a specific biomarker for anti-TNF
induced endoscopic remission. These results can aid in the selection of therapy
in biologic-naïve patients.

The rapid self-renewal of intestinal epithelial cells enhances intestinal
function, promotes the nutritional needs of animals and strengthens intestinal
barrier function to resist the invasion of foreign pathogens. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) 
are a class of short-chain, non-coding RNAs that regulate stem cell proliferation
and differentiation by down-regulating hundreds of conserved target genes after
transcription via seed pairing to the 3' untranslated regions. Numerous studies
have shown that miRNAs can improve intestinal function by participating in the
proliferation and differentiation of different cell populations in the intestine.
In addition, miRNAs also contribute to disease regulation and therefore not only 
play a vital role in the gastrointestinal disease management but also act as
blood or tissue biomarkers of disease. As changes to the levels of miRNAs can
change cell fates, miRNA-mediated gene regulation can be used to update
therapeutic strategies and approaches to disease treatment.

Recent Advance in Very Early Onset Inflammatory Bowel Disease.

Recent studies on pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have revealed that
early-onset IBD has distinct phenotypic differences compared with adult-onset
IBD. In particular, very early-onset IBD (VEO-IBD) differs in many aspects,
including the disease type, location of the lesions, disease behavior, and
genetically attributable risks. Several genetic defects that disturb intestinal
epithelial barrier function or affect immune function have been noted in these
patients from the young age groups. In incidence of pediatric IBD in Korea has
been increasing since the early 2000s. Neonatal or infantile-onset IBD develops
in less than 1% of pediatric patients. Children with "neonatal IBD" or
"infantile-onset IBD" have higher rates of affected first-degree relatives,
severe disease course, and a high rate of resistance to immunosuppressive
treatment. The suspicion of a monogenic cause of VEO-IBD was first confirmed by
the discovery of mutations in the genes encoding the interleukin 10 (IL-10)
receptors that cause impaired IL-10 signaling. Patients with such mutations
typically presented with perianal fistulae, shows a poor response to medical
management, and require early surgical interventions in the first year of life.
To date, 60 monogenic defects have been identified in children with IBD-like
phenotypes. The majority of monogenic defects presents before 6 years of age, and
many present before 1 year of age. Next generation sequencing could become an
important diagnostic tool in children with suspected genetic defects especially
in children with VEO-IBD with severe disease phenotypes. VEO-IBD is a
phenotypically and genetically distinct disease entity from adult-onset or older 
pediatric IBD.

Inflammatory bowel diseases are associated with dysregulated immune responses in 
the intestinal tissue. Four molecularly identified macrophage subsets control
immune homeostasis in healthy gut. However, the specific roles and transcriptomic
profiles of the phenotypically heterogeneous CD14+ macrophage-like population in 
inflamed gut remain to be investigated in Crohn's disease (CD). Here we
identified two phenotypically, morphologically and functionally distinct colonic 
HLADR+SIRPα+CD14+ subpopulations that were further characterized using
single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) in CD. Frequencies of CD64hiCD163-/dim
cells selectively augmented in inflamed colon and correlated with endoscopic
score of disease severity. IL-1β and IL-23-producing CD64hiCD163-/dim cells
predominated over TNF-α-producing CD64hiCD163hi cells in lesions. Purified
"inflammatory monocyte-like" CD163-, but not "macrophage-like" CD163hi cells,
through IL-1β, promoted Th17/Th1 but not Th1 responses in tissue memory CD4+T
cells. Unsupervised scRNAseq analysis that captures the entire HLADR+SIRPα+
population revealed six clusters, two of which were enriched in either CD163- or 
CD163hi cells, and best defined by TREM1/FCAR/FCN1/IL1RN or
CD209/MERTK/MRCI/CD163L1 genes, respectively. Selected newly identified
discriminating markers were used beyond CD163 to isolate cells that shared
pro-Th17/Th1 function with CD163- cells. In conclusion, a molecularly distinct
pro-inflammatory CD14+ subpopulation accumulates in inflamed colon, drives
intestinal inflammatory T-cell responses, and thus, might contribute to CD
disease severity.

Autophagy is an intracellular catabolic process that is essential for a variety
of cellular responses. Due to its role in the maintenance of biological
homeostasis in conditions of stress, dysregulation or disruption of autophagy may
be linked to human diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IBD is a
complicated inflammatory colitis disorder; Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis
are the principal types. Genetic studies have shown the clinical relevance of
several autophagy-related genes (ATGs) in the pathogenesis of IBD. Additionally, 
recent studies using conditional knockout mice have led to a comprehensive
understanding of ATGs that affect intestinal inflammation, Paneth cell
abnormality and enteric pathogenic infection during colitis. In this review, we
discuss the various ATGs involved in macroautophagy and selective autophagy,
including ATG16L1, IRGM, LRRK2, ATG7, p62, optineurin and TFEB in the maintenance
of intestinal homeostasis. Although advances have been made regarding the
involvement of ATGs in maintaining intestinal homeostasis, determining the
precise contribution of autophagy has remained elusive. Recent efforts based on
direct targeting of ATGs and autophagy will further facilitate the development of
new therapeutic opportunities for IBD.

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) can be broadly divided into Crohn's disease
(CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) from their clinical phenotypes. Over 150 host
susceptibility genes have been described, although most overlap between CD, UC
and their subtypes, and they do not adequately account for the overall incidence 
or the highly variable severity of disease. Replicating key findings between two 
long-term IBD cohorts, we have defined distinct networks of taxa associations
within intestinal biopsies of CD and UC patients. Disturbances in an association 
network containing taxa of the Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae families,
typically producing short chain fatty acids, characterize frequently relapsing
disease and poor responses to treatment with anti-TNF-α therapeutic antibodies.
Alterations of taxa within this network also characterize risk of later disease
recurrence of patients in remission after the active inflamed segment of CD has
been surgically removed.

PURPOSE: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn's disease (CD)
and ulcerative colitis (UC), is attributed to inappropriate inflammatory response
in intestinal mucosa. Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)/SMAD signaling plays
key role in differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells to T helper 17 (Th17) cells or 
regulatory T (Treg) cells. This study aimed to investigate associations between
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of SMAD family genes and susceptibility to
IBD in a Japanese cohort to elucidate genetic determinants of IBD.
METHODS: This study included 81 patients with CD, 108 patients with UC, and 199
healthy subjects as controls. A total of 21 SNPs in four genes (SMAD2, SMAD3,
SMAD4, and SMAD7) involved in the TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway were genotyped by 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism,
PCR-direct DNA sequencing, or PCR-high resolution melting curve analysis.
RESULTS: Four SNPs (rs13381619, rs9955626, rs1792658, and rs1792671) withinSMAD2,
one SNP within SMAD3 (rs41473580), two SNPs within SMAD4 (rs7229678 and
rs9304407), and one SNP within SMAD7 (rs12956924) were significantly associated
with susceptibility only to UC. rs13381619 within SMAD2, rs4147358 within SMAD3, 
rs9304407 within SMAD4, and rs12956924 within SMAD7 exhibited the strongest
association (p <  0.001, p =  0.021, p =  0.005, and p =  0.001, respectively).
Furthermore, rs4147358 of SMAD3 altered the expression of a luciferase reporter
gene in Jurkat T cell line in vitro.
CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variants of severalSMAD family of genes might alter the
balance of differentiation between Th17 and Treg, resulting in the development of
IBD, especially UC.

Introduction: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a complicated, multifunctional 
disorder characterized by chronic, recurring inflammation of the digestive tract.
The two main types of IBD are ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD).
The aim of the study was to determine single nucleotide polymorphism in fragments
of the genes CARD15/NOD2 and DLG5 in patients from the Lublin Voivodeship.
Patients and Methods: The study was carried out in Lublin (Poland) in 2016. 27
individuals participated in the research. The research group comprised 9 patients
with a diagnosis of Crohn's disease and 9 with ulcerative colitis, aged 20 to 48,
and 9 healthy volunteers.
Results: No SNPs were confirmed for the CARD15/NOD2 gene fragment, but a
substitution (T>C) was found in the DLG5 gene in a Crohn's disease patient.
Conclusion: Absence of extraintestinal symptoms in patients with Crohn's disease 
may be associated with the absence of CARD15/NOD2 SNPs. The study suggests that
SNPs (T>C substitution) affect the function of the DLG5 protein and thus play a
role in the development of IBD, in particular Crohn's disease. The analysis
presented is a pilot study due to the small number of samples.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is one of the two major forms of inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD). Both innate immunity and adaptive immunity are aberrant in IBD.
The pathogenesis of UC includes abnormal inflammation and immune responses of the
digestive tract. Natural killer T (NKT) cells participate in the innate and
adaptive immune responses, together with a vast array of cytokines. Recent
studies suggested that IL-13, IL5 and IL-4 are involved in the occurrence and the
development of UC. Manipulating NKT cells may be a potential strategy to
reconstruct the abnormal immune responses in UC. In this review, we explore the
roles of NKT cells and cytokines in UC. Additionally, neutralizing antibodies and
inhibitors of cytokines produced by NKT cells or their receptors are also
discussed as novel therapeutic choices for UC.

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are sometimes refractory to current therapy or
associated with severe adverse events during immunosuppressive therapy; thus, new
therapies are urgently needed. Recently, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have
attracted attention based on their multitude of functions including
anti-inflammatory effects. However, proper timing of MSC therapy and the
mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of MSCs on colitis are not fully
elucidated. Human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAdMSCs;
1 × 106) were administrated via the tail vein on day 3 (early) or 11 (delayed)
using a 7-day dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced mouse model of colitis. The
effects were evaluated based on colon length, disease activity index (DAI) and
histological score. Cytokine-encoding mRNA levels T cells and macrophages were
evaluated by real-time PCR and flow cytometry. Regarding the timing of
administration, early (day 3) injection significantly ameliorated DSS-induced
colitis in terms of both DAI and histological score, compared to those parameters
with delayed (day 11) injection. With early cell injection, the tissue mRNA
levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine genes (Il10, Tgfb) increased, whereas those 
of inflammatory cytokine genes (Il6, Tnfa and Il17a) decreased significantly.
Regarding the associated mechanism, hAdMSCs suppressed T cell proliferation and
activation in vitro, increased the number of regulatory T cells in vivo and
changed the polarity of macrophages (into the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype) in 
vitro. Timing of injection is critical for the effective therapeutic effects of
hAdMSCs. Furthermore, part of the associated mechanism includes T cell activation
and expansion and altered macrophage polarization.

Recent advances in molecular biology have provided important insights into the
genetic background of various inflammatory diseases. In particular, genome-wide
association studies of inflammatory diseases have revealed genetic loci that play
critical roles in the pathology of inflammation. Whole-exome and whole-genome
sequencing analyses have also identified more than 300 causative genes for
primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs). Some genetic loci that are associated
with inflammatory diseases are mutated in PIDs, suggesting close relationships
between inflammation and PIDs. Inflammatory diseases for which genetic
associations have been described include inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),
multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and systemic 
lupus erythematosus. Herein, I discuss about the genetic interactions between IBD
and PIDs.

Phase variation, the reversible alternation between genetic states, enables
infection by pathogens and colonization by commensals. However, the diversity of 
phase variation remains underexplored. We developed the PhaseFinder algorithm to 
quantify DNA inversion-mediated phase variation. A systematic search of 54,875
bacterial genomes identified 4686 intergenic invertible DNA regions (invertons), 
revealing an enrichment in host-associated bacteria. Invertons containing
promoters often regulate extracellular products, underscoring the importance of
surface diversity for gut colonization. We found invertons containing promoters
regulating antibiotic resistance genes that shift to the ON orientation after
antibiotic treatment in human metagenomic data and in vitro, thereby mitigating
the cost of antibiotic resistance. We observed that the orientations of some
invertons diverge after fecal microbiota transplant, potentially as a result of
individual-specific selective forces.

Inflammatory bowel disease: factors involved in pathogenesis.

Dudík B, Sepová HK, Bilková A.

The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in developed countries
increases every year. The aetiology is still not completely understood and its
clarification is a key prerequisite for effective prophylaxis and therapy. IBD is
most-likely caused by a combination of several factors: environmental, genetic,
immunological, and disruption of intestinal microbiota composition - dysbiosis.
"Westernization" of lifestyle and urbanization seem to be among the most serious 
environmental factors. The pathogenesis is also influenced by the imbalance
between the TH1 and TH2 cellular response and the expression of genes involved in
T cell response and immunodeficiency. Last but not least, the worldwide overuse
of antimicrobial drugs depletes the microbiome, which has a direct impact on the 
development of the dysbiosis. The subject of this review is a detailed
characterization of the above-mentioned factors involved in the onset and
development of IBD. Key words: gut microbiota inflammatory bowel disease
immunopathogenesis dysbiosis.

BACKGROUND: Human studies have demonstrated that olive oil phenolic compounds
reduce inflammatory markers associated with chronic diseases.
OBJECTIVES: To explore the anti-inflammatory effects of extra-virgin olive oil
polyphenols in an experimental model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
METHODS: HLA-B27 transgenic rats were fed an AIN-76 diet containing 10% corn oil 
(CO) or extra-virgin olive oil with high (EVOO) or low phenolic content (ROO) for
3 months. Wild-type rats (WT) were fed the CO diet.
RESULTS: CO-fed HLA-B27 animals developed intestinal inflammation characterized
by diarrhea, increased myeloperoxidase activity, and mucosal injury. None of
these parameters were influenced by EVOO. Gene expression profiling indicated
that proinflammatory pathways were upregulated in the colon mucosa of CO-fed
HLA-B27 rats compared to WT, and this was further confirmed by RT-PCR for the
iNOS, TNFα, and IL1β genes. EVOO significantly reduced TNFα gene expression in
the colon mucosa and decreased total cholesterol blood levels compared to CO
HLA-B27 rats (89.43 ± 3.66 vs. 111.5 ± 8.10 mg/dL, p < 0.05). This latter effect 
with EVOO was associated with reduced HMGCR and increased PPAR-α hepatic gene
expression, compared to ROO.
CONCLUSION: These data indicate that olive oil polyphenols do not control colon
inflammation in HLA-B27 transgenic rats but exert a positive effect on blood
lipids by reducing total cholesterol levels. This preliminary result suggests the
need to explore the efficacy of EVOO rich in polyphenols as a complementary
strategy for managing hypercholesterolemia and to potentially limit
statin-associated myotoxicity.

Prenatal treatment with dexamethasone (DEX) reduces virilization in girls with
congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). It has potential short- and long-term risks
and has been shown to affect cognitive functions. Here, we investigate whether
epigenetic modification of DNA during early developmental stages may be a key
mediating mechanism by which prenatal DEX treatment could result in poor outcomes
in the offspring. We analyzed genome-wide CD4+ T cell DNA methylation, assessed
using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array in 29 individuals (mean age
= 16.4 ± 5.9 years) at risk for CAH and treated with DEX during the first
trimester and 37 population controls (mean age = 17.0 years, SD = 6.1 years). We 
identified 9672 differentially methylated probes (DMPs) associated with DEX
treatment and 7393 DMPs associated with a DEX × sex interaction. DMPs were
enriched in intergenic regions located near epigenetic markers for active
enhancers. Functional enrichment of DMPs was mostly associated with immune
functioning and inflammation but also with nonimmune-related functions.
DEX-associated DMPs enriched near single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
associated with inflammatory bowel disease, and DEX × sex-associated DMPs
enriched near SNPs associated with asthma. DMPs in genes involved in the
regulation and maintenance of methylation and steroidogenesis were identified as 
well. Methylation in the BDNF, FKBP5, and NR3C1 genes were associated with the
performance on several Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition
subscales. In conclusion, this study indicates that DNA methylation is altered
after prenatal DEX treatment. This finding may have implications for the future
health of the exposed individual.

The transcription factor Helios is expressed in a large subset of Foxp3+ Tregs.
We previously proposed that Helios is a marker of thymic derived Treg (tTreg),
while Helios- Treg were induced from Foxp3- T conventional (Tconv) cells in the
periphery (pTreg). To compare the two Treg subpopulations, we generated
Helios-GFP reporter mice and crossed them to Foxp3-RFP reporter mice. The Helios+
Treg population expressed a more activated phenotype, had a slightly higher
suppressive capacity in vitro and expressed a more highly demethylated TSDR but
were equivalent in their ability to suppress inflammatory bowel disease in vivo. 
However, Helios+ Treg more effectively inhibited the proliferation of activated, 
autoreactive splenocytes from scurfy mice. When Helios+ and Helios- Treg were
transferred to lymphoreplete mice, both populations maintained comparable Foxp3
expression, but Foxp3 expression was less stable in Helios- Treg when transferred
to lymphopenic mice. Gene expression profiling demonstrated a large number of
differentially expressed genes and showed that Helios- Treg expressed certain
genes normally expressed in CD4+ Foxp3- T cells. TCR repertoire analysis
indicated very little overlap between Helios+ and Helios- Treg. Thus, Helios+ and

Background: Mucosal IL-13 Receptor alpha 2 (IL13RA2) mRNA expression is one of
the best predictive markers for primary non-responsiveness to infliximab therapy 
in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The objective of this study
was to understand how IL-13Rα2, a negative regulator of IL-13 signaling, can
contribute to IBD pathology. Methods: IL13RA2 knockout (KO) and wild type (WT)
mice were exposed to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in drinking water to induce
colitis. Furthermore, mucosal biopsies and resection specimen of healthy
individuals and IBD patients before the start of anti-tumor necrosis factor
(anti-TNF) therapy were obtained for immunohistochemistry and gene expression
analysis. Results: After induction of DSS colitis, IL13RA2 KO mice had similar
disease severity, but recovered more rapidly than WT animals. Goblet cell numbers
and mucosal architecture were also more rapidly restored in IL13RA2 KO mice. In
mucosal biopsies of active IBD patients, immunohistochemistry revealed that
IL-13Rα2 protein was highly expressed in epithelial cells, while expression was
restricted to goblet cells in healthy controls. Mucosal IL13RA2 mRNA negatively
correlated with mRNA of several goblet cell-specific and barrier genes, and with 
goblet cell numbers. Conclusions: The data suggest that IL-13Rα2 on epithelial
cells contributes to IBD pathology by negatively influencing goblet cell
recovery, goblet cell function and epithelial restoration after injury.
Therefore, blocking IL-13Rα2 could be a promising target for restoration of the
epithelial barrier in IBD.

BACKGROUND: Tissue inflammation in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) is
associated with a decrease in local pH. The gene encoding G-protein-coupled
receptor 65 (GPR65) has recently been reported to be a genetic risk factor for
IBD. In response to extracellular acidification, proton activation of GPR65
stimulates cAMP and Rho signalling pathways. We aimed to analyse the clinical and
functional relevance of the GPR65 associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
rs8005161.
METHODS: 1138 individuals from a mixed cohort of IBD patients and healthy
volunteers were genotyped for SNPs associated with GPR65 (rs8005161, rs3742704)
and galactosylceramidase (rs1805078) by Taqman SNP assays. 2300 patients from the
Swiss IBD Cohort Study (SIBDC) were genotyped for rs8005161 by mass spectrometry 
based SNP genotyping. IBD patients from the SIBDC carrying rs8005161 TT, CT, CC
and non-IBD controls (CC) were recruited for functional studies. Human CD14+
cells were isolated from blood samples and subjected to an extracellular acidic
pH shift, cAMP accumulation and RhoA activation were measured.
RESULTS: In our mixed cohort, but not in SIBDC patients, the minor variant
rs8005161 was significantly associated with UC. In SIBDC patients, we observed a 
consistent trend in increased disease severity in patients carrying the
rs8005161-TT and rs8005161-CT alleles. No significant differences were observed
in the pH associated activation of cAMP production between IBD (TT, CT, WT/CC)
and non-IBD (WT/CC) genotype carriers upon an acidic extracellular pH shift.
However, we observed significantly impaired RhoA activation after an
extracellular acidic pH shift in IBD patients, irrespective of the rs8005161
allele.
CONCLUSIONS: The T allele of rs8005161 might confer a more severe disease course 
in IBD patients. Human monocytes from IBD patients showed impaired pH associated 
RhoA activation upon an acidic pH shift.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) comprises a group of chronic, immune
system-mediated inflammatory diseases that primarily affect the gastrointestinal 
tract. The pathogenesis of the intestinal lesions in IBD remains elusive, but the
inflammation process could be the result of dysfunction of the innate and
adaptive immune systems induced by genetic and environmental factors. In recent
years, research has demonstrated a connection between environmental stressors
that can influence day-night variations, also called circadian rhythms, and
digestive health. In this review, we focus on alterations in the complex
interactions between intestinal mucosa, microbial factors, and the immune
response in the intestinal milieu. We introduce the mechanisms that establish
circadian rhythms and their regulation by the circadian rhythm genes. Evidence of
circadian variation in the defense mechanisms of the intestine and its
implication in the maintenance of a healthy microbiota are presented. Disruption 
of the circadian system can increase the activity of the gut immune system and
the release of inflammatory factors. The link between chronodisruption or
circadian rhythm impairment and IBD demonstrated by experimental and clinical
studies illustrates the potential impact of circadian rhythms on treatment of
these diseases. Future studies that investigate aspects of this subject are
warranted.

Background: The long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) colon cancer-associated transcript-1 
(CCAT1) has been reported to play a vital role in the development of cancer.
Although the link between inflammation and cancer initiation is well established,
whether CCAT1 is involved in inflammation and promotes inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD) malignancy remains undetermined. We aimed to investigate the expression of 
CCAT1 in IBD and the effect of CCAT1 overexpression on intestinal epithelial
barrier function.
Methods: The relationship between CCAT1 and the inflammation-related pathway was 
analyzed in both colorectal cancer (CRC) and IBD patients. Gene expression was
detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. Transepithelial
electrical resistance (TEER) and FD-4 flux measurement were used to test the
effect of CCAT1 and miR-185-3p on intestinal epithelial barrier function.
Luciferase assay was performed to validate the target site of miR-185-3p on
3'-UTR of MLCK mRNA.
Results: Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that several inflammation-related 
genes were enriched in the CCAT1 high-expressed group of CRC patients. The
relationship between CCAT1 and inflammation activation in IBD patients was
further confirmed. CCAT1 expression positively correlated with MLCK, which acts
as a protein kinase to phosphorylate myosin light chain and induces tight
junction protein distribution, whereas it was negatively correlated with
miR-185-3p in IBD tissues. We also determined that CCAT1 overexpression increased
Caco-2 monolayer permeability and upregulated MLCK. Furthermore, CCAT1-induced
MLCK overexpression and IBD disease progression were significantly attenuated by 
miR-185-3p.
Conclusions: The CCAT1/miR-185-3p/MLCK signaling pathway is strongly activated to
destroy barrier function and promotes the pathogenesis of IBD.

BACKGROUND: We fabricated anti-inflammatory scaffold using Mg(OH)2-incorporated
polylactic acid-polyglycolic acid copolymer (MH-PLGA). To demonstrate the
anti-inflammatory effects of the MH-PLGA scaffold, an animal model should be
sensitive to inflammatory responses. The interleukin-10 knockout (IL-10 KO) mouse
is a widely used bowel disease model for evaluating inflammatory responses,
however, few studies have evaluated this mouse for the anti-inflammatory
scaffold.
METHODS: To compare the sensitivity of the inflammatory reaction, the PLGA
scaffold was implanted into IL-10 KO and C57BL/6 mouse kidneys. Morphology,
histology, immunohistochemistry, and gene expression analyses were carried out at
weeks 1, 4, 8, and 12. The anti-inflammatory effect and renal regeneration
potency of the MH-PLGA scaffold was also compared to those of PLGA in IL-10 KO
mice.
RESULTS: The PLGA scaffold-implanted IL-10 KO mice showed kidneys relatively
shrunken by fibrosis, significantly increased inflammatory cell infiltration,
high levels of acidic debris residue, more frequent CD8-, C-reactive protein-,
and ectodysplasin A-positive cells, and higher expression of pro-inflammatory and
fibrotic factors compared to the control group. The MH-PLGA scaffold group showed
lower expression of pro-inflammatory and fibrotic factors, low immune cell
infiltration, and significantly higher expression of anti-inflammatory factors
and renal differentiation related genes compared to the PLGA scaffold group.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the MH-PLGA scaffold had
anti-inflammatory effects and high renal regeneration potency. Therefore, IL-10
KO mice are a suitable animal model for in vivo validation of novel
anti-inflammatory scaffolds.

BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the
colon with an intractable, recurrent course. The goal of UC therapy is to target 
mucosal healing because immune-suppressive therapy for UC frequently results in
relapse. However, few drugs directly target mucosal healing. We, therefore, aim
to evaluate the therapeutic effect of an investigational drug on intestinal
epithelial cells in an in vitro UC model using human colonic organoids.
METHODS: Colonic organoids were isolated from human colon and cultured. A mixture
of cytokines and bacterial components were used to mimic UC in humans. The effect
of the investigational drug on colonic organoid was evaluated by microarray
analysis and 3D immunofluorescence. The enrichment of stem cells was assessed
with a colony formation assay.
RESULTS: Inflammatory stimulation resulted in a significant induction of
inflammatory-related genes in colonic organoids whereas cell differentiation was 
suppressed. Treatment with the investigational drug KAG-308 showed reciprocal
dynamics of gene expression to inflammatory stimulation, which resulted in not
only the suppression of immune response but also the promotion of cellular
differentiation towards secretory lineages. Moreover, SPDEF and Reg4 were
identified as novel targets for the enrichment of intestinal epithelial stem
cells and mucosal healing.
CONCLUSIONS: The establishment of in vitro UC model using human colonic organoid 
could reveal the effects and targets of investigational drugs in intestinal
epithelial cells under inflammation conditions. Further maturation of this system
might be more efficient to predict the effect on UC, as compared with the use of 
animal model, for the development of new drugs.

BACKGROUND: Paratuberculosis is a contagious, chronic and enteric disease in
ruminants, which is caused by Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis
(MAP) infection, resulting in enormous economic losses worldwide. There is
currently no effective cure for MAP infection or a vaccine, it is thus important 
to explore the genetic variants that contribute to host susceptibility to
infection by MAP, which may provide a better understanding of the mechanisms of
paratuberculosis and benefit animal genetic improvement. Herein we performed a
genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genomic regions and candidate
genes associated with susceptibility to MAP infection in dairy cattle.
RESULTS: Using Illumina Bovine 50 K (54,609 SNPs) and GeneSeek HD (138,893 SNPs) 
chips, two analytical approaches were performed, GRAMMAR-GC and ROADTRIPS in 937 
Chinese Holstein cows, among which individuals genotyped by the 50 K chip were
imputed to HD SNPs with Beagle software. Consequently, 15 and 11 significant SNPs
(P < 5 × 10- 5) were identified with GRAMMAR-GC and ROADTDRIPS, respectively. A
total of 10 functional genes were in proximity to (i.e., within 1 Mb) these SNPs,
including IL4, IL5, IL13, IRF1, MyD88, PACSIN1, DEF6, TDP2, ZAP70 and CSF2.
Functional enrichment analysis showed that these genes were involved in immune
related pathways, such as interleukin, T cell receptor signaling pathways and
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), implying their potential associations with
susceptibility to MAP infection. In addition, by examining the publicly available
cattle QTLdb, a previous QTL for MAP was found to be overlapped with one of
regions detected currently at 32.5 Mb on BTA23, where the TDP2 gene was anchored.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we identified 26 SNPs located on 15 chromosomes in
the Chinese Holstein population using two GWAS strategies with high density SNPs.
Integrated analysis of GWAS, biological functions and the reported QTL
information helps to detect positional candidate genes and the identification of 
regions associated with susceptibility to MAP traits in dairy cattle.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn's disease (CD) and
ulcerative colitis, is characterized by chronic inflammation of the
gastrointestinal tract. The etiology involves a combination of genetic and
environmental factors resulting in abnormal immune responses to intestinal
microbiota. Genetic studies have strongly linked genes involved in autophagy to
CD, and genes involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR) to IBD. The UPR is 
triggered in response to accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER), and autophagy plays a key role in relieving ER stress and
restoring homeostasis. This review summarizes the known interactions between
autophagy and the UPR and discusses the impact of these converging pathways on
IBD pathogenesis. With a paucity of effective long-term treatments for IBD,
targeting of synergistic pathways may provide novel and more effective
therapeutic options.

Genotype imputation of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region is a
cost-effective means to infer classical HLA alleles from inexpensive and dense
SNP array data. In the research setting, imputation helps avoid costs for wet
lab-based HLA typing and thus renders association analyses of the HLA in large
cohorts feasible. Yet, most HLA imputation reference panels target Caucasian
ethnicities and multi-ethnic panels are scarce. We compiled a high-quality
multi-ethnic reference panel based on genotypes measured with lllumina's
Immunochip genotyping array and HLA types established using a high-resolution
next generation sequencing approach. Our reference panel includes more than 1,300
samples from Germany, Malta, China, India, Iran, Japan and Korea and samples of
African American ancestry for all classical HLA class I and II alleles including 
HLA-DRB3/4/5. Applying extensive cross-validation, we benchmarked the imputation 
using the HLA imputation tool HIBAG, our multi-ethnic reference and an
independent, previously published data set compiled of subpopulations of the 1000
Genomes project. We achieved average imputation accuracies higher than 0.924 for 
the commonly studied HLA-A, -B, -C, -DQB1 and -DRB1 genes across all ethnicities.
We investigated allele-specific imputation challenges in regard to geographic
origin of the samples using sensitivity and specificity measurements as well as
allele frequencies and identified HLA alleles that are challenging to impute for 
each of the populations separately. In conclusion, our new multi-ethnic reference
data set allows for high resolution HLA imputation of genotypes at all classical 
HLA class I and II genes including the HLA-DRB3/4/5 loci based on diverse
ancestry populations.

Genetically engineered intestinal microbes could be powerful tools to detect and 
treat intestine inflammation due to their non-invasive character, low costs, and 
convenience. Intestinal inflammation is usually detected along with an increasing
concentration of thiosulfate and tetrathionate molecules in the intestines. ThsSR
and TtrSR are two-component biosensors to detect the presence of thiosulfate and 
tetrathionate molecules, respectively. In real-life intestinal inflammation
detection, sophisticated instruments are needed if using fluorescent proteins as 
reporters. However, chromoproteins and other colored small molecules, which can
be seen by the unaided eye, could extend the use of ThsSR and TtrSR biosensors to
detect intestine inflammation. The feasibility of ThsSR and TtrSR systems was
tested by monitoring the fluorescence intensity of sfGFP in response to the
concentration of thiosulfate and tetrathionate, followed by the incorporation of 
the two systems into Escherichia coli Top10 and E. coli Nissle 1917. The
potential for the real-life application of the two systems was further
corroborated by substituting sfGFP with a series of chromoproteins and a
protoviolaceinic acid synthesis cassette as reporter genes. The results indicated
that signal expression of the new systems had a positive correlation with the
concentration of tetrathionate and thiosulfate molecules. Thus, the modified
ThsSR and TtrSR system may potentially be applied in the human body for the
detection of intestinal inflammation.

Autophagy, an intracellular degradation mechanism, has many immunological
functions and is a constitutive process necessary for maintaining cellular
homeostasis and organ structure. One of the functions of autophagy is to control 
the innate immune response. Many studies conducted in recent years have revealed 
the contribution of autophagy to the innate immune response, and relationships
between this process and various diseases have been reported. Inflammatory bowel 
disease is an intractable disorder with unknown etiology; however, immunological 
abnormalities in the intestines are known to be involved in the pathology of
inflammatory bowel disease, as is dysfunction of autophagy. In Crohn's disease,
many associations with autophagy-related genes, such as ATG16L1, IRGM, NOD2, and 
others, have been reported. Abnormalities in the ATG16L1 gene, in particular,
have been reported to cause autophagic dysfunction, resulting in enhanced
production of inflammatory cytokines by macrophages as well as abnormal function 
of Paneth cells, which are important in intestinal innate immunity. In this
review, we provide an overview of the autophagy mechanism in innate immune cells 
in inflammatory bowel disease.

BACKGROUND: The gut microbiota plays a key role in the maintenance of intestinal 
homeostasis and the development and activation of the host immune system. It has 
been shown that commensal bacterial species can regulate the expression of host
genes. 16S rRNA gene sequencing has shown that the microbiota in inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD) is abnormal and characterized by reduced diversity. MicroRNAs
(miRNAs) have been explored as biomarkers and therapeutic targets, since they are
able to regulate specific genes associated with Crohn's disease (CD). In this
work, we aim to investigate the composition of gut microbiota of active
treatment-naïve adult CD patients, with miRNA profile from gut microbiota.
AIM: To investigate the composition of gut microbiota of active treatment-naïve
adult CD patients, with miRNA profile from gut microbiota.
METHODS: Patients attending the outpatient clinics at Valme University Hospital
without relevant co-morbidities were matched according to age and gender. Faecal 
samples of new-onset CD patients, free of treatment, and healthy controls were
collected. Faecal samples were homogenized, and DNA was amplified by PCR using
primers directed to the 16S bacterial rRNA gene. Pyrosequencing was performed
using GS-Junior platform. For sequence analysis, MG-RAST server with the database
Ribosomal Project was used. MiRNA profile and their relative abundance were
analyzed by quantitative PCR.
RESULTS: Microbial community was characterized using 16S rRNA gene sequencing in 
29 samples (n = 13 CD patients, and n = 16 healthy controls). The mean Shannon
diversity was higher in the healthy control population compared to CD group (5.5 
vs 3.7). A reduction in Firmicutes and an increase in Bacteroidetes were found.
Clostridia class was also significantly reduced in CD. Principal components
analysis showed a grouping pattern, identified in most of the subjects in both
groups, showing a marked difference between control and CD groups. A functional
metabolic study showed that a lower metabolism of carbohydrates (P = 0.000) was
found in CD group, while the metabolism of lipids was increased. In CD patients, 
three miRNAs were induced in affected mucosa: mir-144 (6.2 ± 1.3 fold), mir-519
(21.8 ± 3.1) and mir-211 (2.3 ± 0.4).
CONCLUSION: Changes in microbial function in active non-treated CD subjects and
three miRNAs in affected vs non-affected mucosa have been found. miRNAs profile
may serve as a biomarker.

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are a major problem for public health, with an 
increased incidence and impact on life quality. The effect of pre- and probiotic 
combination has been less studied in IBD. Using genomic and proteomic array
technologies, this study examined the efficacy of a new combination of natural
alternatives: prebiotics (grape pomace extract, GP) and probiotics (lactobacilli 
mixture, Lb mix) on inflammation and intracellular signalling routes in a
cellular model of inflammation. Caco-2 cells challenged with lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) for 4 h were treated with GP extract (50 μg/ml gallic acid equivalent) and 
Lb combination (3 × 108 colony-forming units/ml total Lb) for 24 h. The profile
expressions of forty key inflammatory markers and twenty-six signalling kinases
were analysed. Other markers involved in inflammation were also investigated
(NF-κB/RELA, Nrf2, aryl hydrocarbon receptor, Cyp1A1, Cyp1B1); 57·5 and 60 % of
investigated genes and proteins, respectively, were down-regulated by the
synbiotic combination. Relevant cytokines and chemokines involved in response to 
microbial infection and inflammation were reduced under the level induced by LPS 
treatment and toward the unchallenged control. As expected, the reduction effect 
seems to imply mitogen-activated protein kinase and NF-κB pathway. Most of the
signalling molecules activated by LPS were decreased by GP extract and Lb mix.
Our study indicates that the synbiotic combination of GP extract and
Lactobacillus sp. mixture exerted anti-inflammatory properties, which are able to
decrease the majority of inflammatory genes, their proteins and associated
signalling markers. Due to protective role of GP compounds on lactobacilli
probiotic, this synbiotic combination might serve as a promising adjunctive
therapy in intestinal inflammations.

BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), are chronic, relapsing-remitting
diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, including Crohn's disease (CD),
Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Unclassified IBD (IBDU). Their pathogenesis involves 
genes and environment as cofactors in inducing autoimmunity; particularly the
interactions between enteric pathogens and immunity is being studied.
Helicobacter pylori (HP) is common pathogen causing gastric inflammation. Studies
found an inverse prevalence association between HP and IBD, suggesting a
potential protecting role of HP from IBD.
METHODS: A literature search of the PubMed database was performed using the key
words ''helicobacter pylori'', ''inflammatory bowel disease'', ''crohn disease'',
"ulcerative colitis". Embase, Medline (OvidSP), Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed
publisher, Cochrane and Google Scholar were also searched. Prevalence rate-ratios
among HP in IBD patients, HP in CD patients, HP in UC patients, HP in IBDU
patients were extracted, each group was compared with controls, to verify the
inverse association between HP and IBD prevalence.
RESULTS: In all groups the dispersion of data suggested an inverse association
between IBD group and controls, even when the comparison was carried out
separately between each group of newly diagnosed patients and controls, to rule
out the possible bias of ongoing pharmacologic therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this review show a striking inverse association
between HP infection and the prevalence of IBD, independently from the type of
IBD considered across distinct geographic regions. Anyway, data should be
interpreted cautiously, as wider, prospective and more homogeneous research on
this topic are awaited, which could open new scenarios about environmental
etiology of IBD.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is the most prevalent clinical
manifestation of the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Several candidate genes
have been suggested to be involved in the genetic susceptibility or resistance in
the development of UC. Among them, tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily
member 15 (TNFSF15) have been reported in association with IBD in several
studies. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of TNFSF15 gene
polymorphisms located in the promoter region, including rs6478108 (G/A -9706) and
rs3810936 (G/A -15524) in Iranian patients with UC. METHODS: In this way, the two
single nucleotide polymorphisms were studied in 115 patients with UC and 115
healthy controls with the same ethnic group from south-west of Iran. The genomic 
DNA of samples was genotyped using TaqMan Real-time PCR assay. This case-control 
study was conducted at the Department of Immunology, Jundishapur University of
Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Our results did not
confirm the formerly reported association of the studied polymorphisms with UC
disease in comparison with healthy controls, neither with the type of the
clinical forms of Colitis in the studied Iranian population. Comparing the
genotype frequency of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs6478108, wild-type
homozygous and heterozygote and mutant homozygote were 33%, 55.7%, and 11.3% in
cases vs. 34.8%, 50.4%, and 14.8% in the controls (P = 0.6). The genotype
frequency of SNP rs3810936 were 20.9%, 40.9%, and 38.2% in the cases compared to 
18.3%, 44.3%, and 37.4% in controls, which was not significant ( P = 0.8). As
multiple ethnic groups reside in all around the country, further studies using
different ethnicities and/or larger sample size are required to clarify the role 
of these polymorphisms in the genetic susceptibility of UC in Iranian
populations.

The current study examines expression of S100 genes, a group of calcium-sensing
proteins poorly characterized in fishes. In mammals, these proteins are known to 
play roles beyond calcium-signaling, including mediation of inflammatory
processes. Some S100 proteins also serve as biomarkers for a variety of
autoinflammatory conditions. It is well known that salmonids exhibit varying
degrees of intestinal enteritis when exposed to alternative feed ingredients
containing antinutritional factors, with soybean meal (SBM) being one of the best
characterized. The etiology of soy-caused distal enteritis isn't entirely
understood but displays similar histopathological alterations to the gut observed
in human mucosal inflammatory bowel diseases. We sought to determine if teleost
S100 genes show a concomitant response like that observed in mammals, utilizing
rainbow trout fed high-soy diets as a model for intestinal inflammation. We
examined expression of fourteen known salmonid S100 genes in the liver, first
segment of the mid-intestine (proximal intestine), and second segment of the
mid-intestine (distal intestine). After 12 weeks on a high-soy diet containing
40% SBM, we observed upregulation of several S100 genes in the distal intestine
(S100I2, A10a, V1, V2, and W), no changes in the proximal intestine, and
downregulation of S100V2 in the liver. Overall, our results provide further
knowledge of the expression of S100 genes and provide targets for future research
regarding inflammatory processes in the rainbow trout gut.

BACKGROUND: Faecalibacterium prausnitzii is a ubiquitous member of the human gut 
microbiome, constituting up to 15% of the total bacteria in the human gut.
Substantial evidence connects decreased levels of F. prausnitzii with the onset
and progression of certain forms of inflammatory bowel disease, which has been
attributed to its anti-inflammatory potential. Two phylogroups of F. prausnitzii 
have been identified, with a decrease in phylogroup I being a more sensitive
marker of intestinal inflammation. Much of the genomic and physiological data
available to date was collected using phylogroup II strains. Little analysis of
F. prausnitzii genomes has been performed so far and genetic differences between 
phylogroups I and II are poorly understood.
RESULTS: In this study we sequenced 11 additional F. prausnitzii genomes and
performed comparative genomics to investigate intraspecies diversity, functional 
gene complement and the mobilome of 31 high-quality draft and complete genomes.
We reveal a very low level of average nucleotide identity among F. prausnitzii
genomes and a high level of genome plasticity. Two genomogroups can be separated 
based on differences in functional gene complement, albeit that this division
does not fully agree with separation based on conserved gene phylogeny,
highlighting the importance of horizontal gene transfer in shaping F. prausnitzii
genomes. The difference between the two genomogroups is mainly in the complement 
of genes associated with catabolism of carbohydrates (such as a predicted
sialidase gene in genomogroup I) and amino acids, as well as defense mechanisms.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the combination of ANI of genomic sequences, phylogenetic
analysis of core proteomes and functional differences we propose to separate the 
species F. prausnitzii into two new species level taxa: F. prausnitzii sensu
stricto (neotype strain A2-165T = DSM 17677T = JCM 31915T) and F. moorei sp. nov.
(type strain ATCC 27768T = NCIMB 13872T).

Dysregulation of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) expression is linked to the
development of various diseases. Recently, an emerging body of evidence has
indicated that lncRNAs play important roles in the pathogenesis of inflammatory
bowel diseases (IBDs), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative Colitis
(UC). In IBD, lncRNAs have been shown to be involved in diverse processes,
including the regulation of intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis, association
with lipid metabolism, and cell-cell interactions, thereby enhancing inflammation
and the functional regulation of regulatory T cells. In this review, we aim to
summarize the current knowledge regarding the role of lncRNAs in IBD and
highlight potential avenues for future investigation. We also collate potentially
immune-relevant, IBD-associated lncRNAs identified through a built-by association
analysis with respect to their neighboring protein-coding genes within
IBD-susceptible loci. We further underscore their importance by highlighting
their enrichment for various aspects of immune system regulation, including
antigen processing/presentation, immune cell proliferation and differentiation,
and chronic inflammatory responses. Finally, we summarize the potential of
lncRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers in IBD.

OBJECTIVES: The gut microbiome is believed to play a role in the susceptibility
to and treatment of Clostridium difficile infections (CDIs). It is, however,
unknown whether the gut microbiome is also affected by asymptomatic C difficile
colonization. Our study aimed to evaluate the fecal microbiome of children based 
on C difficile colonization, and CDI risk factors, including antibiotic use and
comorbid inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
METHODS: Subjects with IBD and non-IBD controls were prospectively enrolled from 
pediatric clinics for a biobanking project (n = 113). A fecal sample was
collected from each subject for research purposes only and was evaluated for
asymptomatic toxigenic C difficile colonization. Fecal microbiome composition was
determined by 16S rRNA sequencing.
RESULTS: We found reduced bacterial diversity and altered microbiome composition 
in subjects with C difficile colonization, concurrent antibiotic use, and/or
concomitant IBD (all P < 0.05). Accounting for antibiotic use and IBD status,
children colonized with C difficile had significant enrichment in taxa from the
genera Ruminococcus, Eggerthella, and Clostridium. Children without C difficile
had increased relative abundances of Faecalibacterium and Rikenellaceae. Imputed 
metagenomic functions of those colonized were enriched for genes in oxidative
phosphorylation and beta-lactam resistance, whereas in the subjects without C
difficile, several functions in translation and metabolism were over-represented.
CONCLUSIONS: In children, C difficile colonization, or factors that predispose to
colonization such as antibiotic use and IBD status were associated with decreased
gut bacterial diversity and altered microbiome composition. Averting such
microbiome alterations may be a method to prevent or treat CDI.

Background: Hypoalgesic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a condition in which
patients with active disease do not perceive and/or report abdominal pain, is
associated with serious complications and there is a lack of cost-effective,
reliable diagnostic methods to identify "at-risk" patients. The voltage-gated
sodium channels (VGSC's), Nav1.7, Nav1.8, and Nav1.9, are preferentially
expressed on nociceptive neurons, and have been implicated in visceral
inflammatory pain. At least 29 VGSC single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have
been implicated in chronic somatic pain syndromes, but little is known about
their role in human visceral sensation. We hypothesized that disruptive VGSC
polymorphisms result in anti-nociceptive behavior in IBD. Methods and Findings:
We performed targeted exome sequencing and/or TaqMan genotyping to evaluate the
Nav1.7, Nav1.8, and Nav1.9 genes (SCN9A, SCN10A and SCN11A) in 121 IBD patients
(including 41 "hypoalgesic" IBD patients) and 86 healthy controls. Allelic and
genotypic frequencies of polymorphisms were compared among study groups who had
undergone characterization of intestinal inflammatory status and abdominal pain
experience. Forty-nine total exonic SNPs were identified. The allelic frequency
of only one non-synonymous SNP (rs6795970 [SCN10A]) approached significance in
hypoalgesic IBD patients when compared to other IBD patients (p = 0.096, Fisher's
exact test). Hypoalgesic IBD patients were more likely to be homozygous for this 
polymorphism (46 vs. 22%, p = 0.01, Fisher's exact test). Conclusions: This is
the first human study to demonstrate a link between a genetic variant of SCN10A
and abdominal pain perception in IBD. These findings provide key insights into
visceral nociceptive physiology and new diagnostic and therapeutic targets to
consider in IBD and other gastrointestinal conditions associated with chronic
abdominal pain. Further studies are required to elucidate the precise
pathophysiological impact of the rs6795970 polymorphism on human gastrointestinal
nociception.

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic relapsing immune-mediated disorders
that result from an aberrant immunological response. IBD comprises of Crohn's
disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The precise aetiology of IBD has not
been fully understood, however, recent studies support the hypothesis that
patients with IBD have a dysregulated immune response to endogenous bacteria in
the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). The increasing number of hospitalisation
coupled with the high economic burden faced by IBD patients, calls for more
concerted research efforts, to design a potent and credible treatment option for 
these strata of patients. This research was designed to test the efficacy and
potency of β-D Mannuronic acid (M2000) in the treatment of IBD. Ten ml of blood
was aseptically collected from 24 IBD patients and 24 normal controls. PBMC was
isolated and stimulated with 1 µg/mL of LPS and incubated for 4 hours. The cells 
were later treated with 10 µg/mL or 50 µg/mL of Mannuronic acid and incubated for
24 hours at 370C under 5% CO2 and 100% humidity. After the incubation, RNA was
extracted from the cells, cDNA was synthesised, and the expression of the gene
was evaluated using quantitative real-time PCR. The result indicated a
significant down-regulation of RORC and IL-17 genes expression, while the
expression of IL-4 and GATA3 genes were significantly up-regulated. These
research findings have shown that M2000 a biocompatible agent, that has an
immunotherapeutic, immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive effects on the PBMC of 
IBD patients.

Background: Tissue inflammation in inflammatory bowel diseases [IBD] is
associated with local acidification. Genetic variants in the pH-sensing G
protein-coupled receptor 65, also known as T cell death-associated gene 8
[TDAG8], have been implicated in IBD and other autoimmune diseases. Since the
role of TDAG8 in intestinal inflammation remains unclear, we investigated the
function of TDAG8 using murine colitis models.
Methods: The effects of TDAG8 deficiency were assessed in dextran sodium sulphate
[DSS], IL-10-/-, and T cell transfer colitis murine models. RNA sequencing of
acidosis-activated TDAG8-/- and wild-type [WT] peritoneal macrophages [MΦs] was
performed.
Results: mRNA expression of IFN-γ, TNF, IL-6, and iNOS in TDAG8-/- mice increased
significantly in colonic lymphoid patches and in colonic tissue in acute and
chronic DSS colitis, respectively. In transfer colitis, there was a trend towards
increased IFN-γ, iNOS, and IL-6 expression in mice receiving TDAG8-/- T cells.
However, absence of TDAG8 did not lead to changes in clinical scores in the
models tested. Increased numbers of infiltrating MΦs and neutrophils, but not
CD3+ T cells, were observed in DSS-treated TDAG8-/- mice. No differences in
infiltrating CD3+ T cells were observed between mice receiving TDAG8-/- or WT
naïve T cells in transfer colitis. RNA sequencing showed that acidosis activation
of TDAG8 in MΦs modulated the expression of immune response genes.
Conclusions: TDAG8 deficiency triggers colonic MΦ and neutrophil infiltration,
and expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in DSS colitis models. In transfer
colitis, mice receiving TDAG8-/- T cells presented a significantly higher spleen 
weight and a tendency towards increased expression of pro-inflammatory markers of
monocyte/MΦ activity.

Background: Several pathogens have been debated to play a role in inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD) including Crohn's disease (CD). None of these pathogens have 
been investigated together in same clinical samples. We developed a multiplex PCR
and multi-color fluorescent in situ hybridization (m-FISH) protocols for
simultaneous detection of CD-associated pathogens including Mycobacterium avium
subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP), Klebsiella pneumoniae, and adherent-invasive
Escherichia coli strain LF82.
Methods: The multiplex PCR is based on 1-h DNAzol® extraction protocol modified
for rapid extraction of bacterial DNA from culture, blood, and intestinal
biopsies. Oligonucleotide primers sequences unique to these pathogens were
evaluated individually and in combinations using bioinformatics and experimental 
approaches. m-FISH was based on fluorescent-tagged oligonucleotides and confocal 
scanning laser microscopy (CSLM).
Results: Following several attempts, the concentration of the oligonucleotide
primers and DNA templates and the PCR annealing temperatures were optimized.
Multiplex PCR analyses revealed excellent amplification signal in trials where a 
single primer set and combinations of two and three primers sets were tested
against a mixture of DNA from three different bacteria or a mixture of three
bacterial cultures mixed in one tube before DNA extraction. Slides with
individual and mixtures of bacterial cultures and intestinal tissue sections from
IBD patients were tested by m-FISH and the CSLM images verified multiplex PCR
results detected on 3% agarose gel.
Conclusion: We developed a 4-h multiplex PCR protocol, which was validated by
m-FISH images, capable of detecting up to four genes from major pathogens
associated with CD. The new protocol should serve as an excellent tool to support
efforts to study multi-pathogens involved in CD and other autoimmune disease.

The DNA sequence of the two human mucin genes MUC2 and MUC6 have not been
completely resolved due to the repetitive nature of their central exon coding for
Proline, Threonine and Serine rich sequences. The exact nucleotide sequence of
these exons has remained unknown for a long time due to limitations in
traditional sequencing techniques. These are still very poorly covered in new
whole genome sequencing projects with the corresponding protein sequences partly 
missing. We used a BAC clone containing both these genes and third generation
sequencing technology, SMRT sequencing, to obtain the full-length contiguous MUC2
and MUC6 tandem repeat sequences. The new sequences span the entire repeat
regions with good coverage revealing their length, variation in repeat sequences 
and their internal organization. The sequences obtained were used to compare with
available sequences from whole genome sequencing projects indicating variation in
number of repeats and their internal organization between individuals. The lack
of these sequences has limited the association of genetic alterations with
disease. The full sequences of these mucins will now allow such studies, which
could be of importance for inflammatory bowel diseases for MUC2 and gastric ulcer
diseases for MUC6 where deficient mucus protection is assumed to play an
important role.

Background: Colitis-associated cancer (CAC) is one of the prognostic factors in
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and prevention of CAC is a critical concern for
patients with IBD. Component cells of the microenvironment, especially
myofibroblasts, are known to affect tumor development, but the role of intestinal
myofibroblasts (IMFs) in CAC has not been clarified. Here, we explored the role
of IMFs in CAC and sought to identify candidate genes as novel therapeutic
targets for the prevention of CAC.
Methods: We used the azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model for
dysplasia and CAC. Flow cytometry and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) were performed to 
obtain an unbiased gene expression profile of IMFs. The transcriptome of
significantly differentially expressed genes was analyzed by RNA-seq,
quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and
immunohistochemistry.
Results: Comparison of normal intestinal fibroblasts and IMFs revealed 1045 genes
with significantly differential expression. Among them, we focused on tenascin-C 
(TNC; q = 0.00232, Log2(Fold Change) = 3.87). Tenascin-C gene expression was
markedly increased in the dysplasia model compared with control and CAC model (P 
< 0.05). Tenascin-C protein was barely expressed in normal and nondysplastic
mucosa but strongly expressed in the stroma around dysplastic lesions. Moreover, 
TNC surrounded and enclosed integrin αvβ3-positive microvessels. Administration
of ATN-161, an antagonist of αvβ3-integrin, significantly suppressed
tumorigenesis of CAC through inhibition of angiogenesis (P < 0.05).
Conclusions: In the early stages of CAC, TNC produced by IMFs affects tumor
development via integrin αvβ3-mediated angiogenesis. Intestinal myofibroblasts
might be a novel therapeutic target for preventing CAC.

Background: We aim to identify the differences in colonic mucosal transcriptome
between Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) for a better
understanding of the molecular pathology.
Methods: Differentially expressed genes (DEG) in the colonic mucosa of CD and UC 
were identified with a global gene expression microarray dataset generated from
the colon biopsies of CD and UC patients and normal controls. The DEGs were then 
processed to identify altered pathways and modularized DEGs and pathways.
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis with an
independent cohort of samples was performed to validate the microarray data.
Results: At the pathway level, virus infection and autoimmune pathways were
upregulated in CD but not in UC when compared with controls. Some of the relevant
DEGs (such as TAP1 and TAP2) were elevated in both CD and UC, with CD exhibiting 
more pronounced elevations. Gene expression levels in viral infection pathways
were correlated with those of autoimmune pathways. In contrast, pattern
recognition-mediated innate immune pathways (TLR4 and TLR2) were significantly
elevated in UC but not in CD. Similar results were observed with an independent
cohort by qRT-PCR.
Conclusions: Our data support the hypothesis that viral infection induced
autoimmunity may represent a pathomechanism for IBD, especially CD. However,
pattern recognition-mediated innate immunity targeting microbiome may play a more
important role in UC compared with CD. Our findings identified different
intervention targets for CD and UC, which may lead to more effective treatments
for IBD patients.

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are debilitating chronic inflammatory disorders
that develop as a result of a defective immune response toward intestinal
bacteria. Intestinal dysbiosis is associated with the onset of IBD and has been
reported to persist even in patients in deep remission. We investigated the
possibility of a dietary-induced switch to the gut microbiota composition using
Winnie mice as a model of spontaneous ulcerative colitis and chow enriched with
1% Bronze tomato. We used the near isogenic tomato line strategy to investigate
the effects of a diet enriched in polyphenols administered to mild but
established chronic intestinal inflammation. The Bronze-enriched chow
administered for two weeks was not able to produce any macroscopic effect on the 
IBD symptoms, although, at molecular level there was a significant induction of
anti-inflammatory genes and intracellular staining of T cells revealed a mild
decrease in IL17A and IFNγ production. Analysis of the microbial composition
revealed that two weeks of Bronze enriched diet was sufficient to perturb the
microbial composition of Winnie and control mice, suggesting that
polyphenol-enriched diets may create unfavorable conditions for distinct
bacterial species. In conclusion, dietary regimes enriched in polyphenols may
efficiently support IBD remission affecting the intestinal dysbiosis.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: The role of miR-15 in ulcerative colitis (UC) is unclear. In
this study, we found that miR-15 downregulated the expression of adenosine A2a
receptor (A2aAR) in the colonic tissues of patients with UC and in HT-29 human
colonic epithelial cells.
METHODS: The study population comprised patients with UC (n=23), irritable bowel 
syndrome (IBS, n=22), and healthy subjects (n = 20). The levels of miR-15, A2aAR,
and protein in colon tissue biopsies were determined by real-time quantitative
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, immunofluorescence staining, and
Western blotting. The TargetScan prediction algorithm was used to identify the
miR-15 binding site in the 3'-UTR of A2aAR. To assess the effects of miR-15 on
A2aAR levels, HT-29 cells were transfected with miR-15 mimics.
RESULTS: Relative to expression in healthy subjects, A2aAR expression was
decreased in UC patients and was similar in IBS patients. MiR-15 levels were
higher in UC patients than in IBS patients or healthy subjects. A2aAR was the
target of miR-15 in HT-29 cells, which downregulated A2aAR mRNA levels. MiR-15
mimics induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 and upregulated the expression 
of IL-8 and IFN-γ in colonic epithelial cells; these effects were reversed by an 
miR-15 inhibitor. A2aAR knockdown confirmed that miR-15 activated the NF-κB
cascade.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that miR-15 modulates inflammatory and immune
responses by suppressing the expression of A2aAR and regulating the NF-κB
cascade.

Background and Aims: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of European
populations have identified numerous susceptibility loci for Crohn's disease
(CD). Susceptibility genes differ by ethnicity, however, so GWASs specific for
Asian populations are required. This study aimed to clarify the Japanese-specific
genetic background for CD by a GWAS using the Japonica array (JPA) and subsequent
imputation with the 1KJPN reference panel.
Methods: Two independent Japanese case/control sets (Tohoku region [379 CD
patients, 1621 controls] and Kyushu region [334 CD patients, 462 controls]) were 
included. GWASs were performed separately for each population followed by a
meta-analysis. Two additional replication sets (254 + 516 CD patients and 287 +
565 controls) were analysed for top hit SNPs from novel genomic regions.
Results: Genotype data of 4,335,144 SNPs from 713 Japanese CD patients and 2083
controls were analysed. SNPs located in TNFSF15 (rs78898421, Pmeta = 2.59 ×
10-26, odds ratio [OR] = 2.10), HLA-DQB1 (rs184950714, Pmeta = 3.56 × 10-19, OR =
2.05), ZNF365 and 4p14 loci were significantly associated with CD in Japanese
individuals. Replication analyses were performed for four novel candidate loci (P
< 1 × 10-6), and rs488200 located upstream of RAP1A was significantly associated 
with CD (Pcombined = 4.36 × 10-8, OR = 1.31). Transcriptome analysis of CD4+
effector memory T cells from lamina propria mononuclear cells of CD patients
revealed a significant association of rs488200 with RAP1A expression.
Conclusion: RAP1A is a novel susceptibility locus for CD in the Japanese
population.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is one of the immune-related gastrointestinal
disorders, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, that affects the
life quality of millions of people worldwide. IBD symptoms include abdominal
pain, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding, which may result from the interactions among
gut microbiota, food components, intestinal epithelial cells, and immune cells.
It is of particular importance to assess how each key gene expressed in
intestinal epithelial and immune cells affects inflammation in the colon. G
protein-coupled taste receptors, including G protein subunit α-gustducin and
other signaling proteins, have been found in the intestines. Here, we use
α-gustducin as a representative and describe a dextran sulfate sodium
(DSS)-induced IBD model to evaluate the effect of gustatory gene mutations on gut
mucosal immunity and inflammation. This method combines gene knockout technology 
with the chemically induced IBD model, and thus can be applied to assess the
outcome of gustatory gene nullification as well as other genes that may exuberate
or dampen the DSS-induced immune response in the colon. Mutant mice are
administered with DSS for a certain period during which their body weight, stool,
and rectal bleeding are monitored and recorded. At different timepoints during
administration, some mice are euthanized, then the sizes and weights of their
spleens and colons are measured and gut tissues are collected and processed for
histological and gene expression analyses. The data show that the α-gustducin
knockout results in excessive weight loss, diarrhea, intestinal bleeding, tissue 
damage, and inflammation vs. wild-type mice. Since the severity of induced
inflammation is affected by mouse strains, housing environment, and diet,
optimization of DSS concentration and administration duration in a pilot
experiment is particularly important. By adjusting these factors, this method can
be applied to assess both anti- and pro-inflammatory effects.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Intestinal fibrosis is a long-term complication in
inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) that frequently results in functional damage,
bowel obstruction, and surgery. Interleukin (IL) 36 is a group of cytokines in
the IL1 family with inflammatory effects. We studied the expression of IL36 and
its receptor, interleukin 1 receptor like 2 (IL1RL2 or IL36R) in the development 
of intestinal fibrosis in human tissues and mice.
METHODS: We obtained intestinal tissues from 92 patients with Crohn's disease
(CD), 48 patients with ulcerative colitis, and 26 patients without inflammatory
bowel diseases (control individuals). Tissues were analyzed by histology to
detect fibrosis and by immunohistochemistry to determine the distribution of
fibroblasts and levels of IL36R ligands. Human and mouse fibroblasts were
incubated with IL36 or control medium, and transcriptome-wide RNA sequences were 
analyzed. Mice were given neutralizing antibodies against IL36R, and we studied
intestinal tissues from Il1rl2-/- mice; colitis and fibrosis were induced in mice
by repetitive administration of DSS or TNBS. Bone marrow cells were transplanted 
from Il1rl2-/- to irradiated wild-type mice and intestinal tissues were analyzed.
Antibodies against IL36R were applied to mice with established chronic colitis
and fibrosis and intestinal tissues were studied.
RESULTS: Mucosal and submucosal tissue from patients with CD or ulcerative
colitis had higher levels of collagens, including type VI collagen, compared with
tissue from control individuals. In tissues from patients with fibrostenotic CD, 
significantly higher levels of IL36A were noted, which correlated with high
numbers of activated fibroblasts that expressed α-smooth muscle actin. IL36R
activation of mouse and human fibroblasts resulted in expression of genes that
regulate fibrosis and tissue remodeling, as well as expression of collagen type
VI. Il1rl2-/- mice and mice given injections of an antibody against IL36R
developed less severe colitis and fibrosis after administration of DSS or TNBS,
but bone marrow cells from Il1rl2-/- mice did not prevent induction of colitis
and fibrosis. Injection of antibodies against IL36R significantly reduced
established fibrosis in mice with chronic intestinal inflammation.
CONCLUSION: We found higher levels of IL36A in fibrotic intestinal tissues from
patients with IBD compared with control individuals. IL36 induced expression of
genes that regulate fibrogenesis in fibroblasts. Inhibition or knockout of the
IL36R gene in mice reduces chronic colitis and intestinal fibrosis. Agents
designed to block IL36R signaling could be developed for prevention and treatment
of intestinal fibrosis in patients with IBD.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) regulates genes
involved in the inflammatory response, amino acid metabolism, autophagy, and
endoplasmic reticulum stress. We investigated whether its activity is altered in 
patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) and mice with enterocolitis.
METHODS: We obtained biopsy samples during endoscopy from inflamed and/or
uninflamed regions of the colon from 21 patients with active Crohn's disease
(CD), 22 patients with active ulcerative colitis (UC), and 38 control individuals
without IBD and of the ileum from 19 patients with active CD and 8 individuals
without IBD in China. Mice with disruption of Atf4 specifically in intestinal
epithelial cells (Atf4ΔIEC mice) and Atf4-floxed mice (controls) were given
dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) to induce colitis. Some mice were given injections
of recombinant defensin α1 (DEFA1) and supplementation of l-alanyl-glutamine or
glutamine in drinking water. Human and mouse ileal and colon tissues were
analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunoblots, and
immunohistochemistry. Serum and intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) amino acids were
measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.
Levels of ATF4 were knocked down in IEC-18 cells with small interfering RNAs.
Microbiomes were analyzed in ileal feces from mice by using 16S ribosomal DNA
sequencing.
RESULTS: Levels of ATF4 were significantly decreased in inflamed intestinal
mucosa from patients with active CD or active UC compared with those from
uninflamed regions or intestinal mucosa from control individuals. ATF4 was also
decreased in colonic epithelia from mice with colitis vs mice without colitis.
Atf4ΔIEC mice developed spontaneous enterocolitis and colitis of greater severity
than control mice after administration of DSS. Atf4ΔIEC mice had decreased serum 
levels of glutamine and reduced levels of antimicrobial peptides, such as Defa1, 
Defa4, Defa5, Camp, and Lyz1, in ileal Paneth cells. Atf4ΔIEC mice had
alterations in ileal microbiomes compared with control mice; these changes were
reversed by administration of glutamine. Injections of DEFA1 reduced the severity
of spontaneous enteritis and DSS-induced colitis in Atf4ΔIEC mice. We found that 
expression of solute carrier family 1 member 5 (SLC1A5), a glutamine transporter,
was directly regulated by ATF4 in cell lines. Overexpression of SLC1A5 in IEC-18 
or primary IEC cells increased glutamine uptake and expression of antimicrobial
peptides. Knockdown of ATF4 in IEC-18 cells increased expression of inflammatory 
cytokines, whereas overexpression of SLC1A5 in the knockdown cells reduced
cytokine expression. Levels of SLC1A5 were decreased in inflamed intestinal
mucosa of patients with CD and UC and correlated with levels of ATF4.
CONCLUSIONS: Levels of ATF4 are decreased in inflamed intestinal mucosa from
patients with active CD or UC. In mice, ATF4 deficiency reduces glutamine uptake 
by intestinal epithelial cells and expression of antimicrobial peptides by
decreasing transcription of Slc1a5. ATF4 might therefore be a target for the
treatment of IBD.

Background: A combination of genetic and environmental factors is thought to be
involved in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC). In Iceland, the
incidence of UC is one of the highest in the world. The aim of this study was to 
characterize patients with UC and identify potential germline mutations and
pathways that could be associated with UC in this population.
Methods: Exome sequencing and genome-wide microarray analysis on macroscopically 
noninflamed colonic mucosa from patients and controls were performed. Exome
sequence data were examined for very rare or novel mutations that were
over-represented in the UC cohort. Combined matching of variant analysis and
downstream influence on transcriptomic expression in the rectum were analyzed.
Results: One thousand eight hundred thirty-eight genes were differentially
expressed in rectal tissue from UC patients and identified an upregulation in
genes associated with cell cycle control and protein processing in the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Two missense mutations in thiopurine
S-methyltransferase (TPMT) with a minor allele frequency of 0.22 in the UC
patients compared with a reported 0.062 in the Icelandic population were
identified. A predicted damaging mutation in the gene SLC26A3 is potentially
associated with increased expression of DUOX2 and DUOXA2 in rectal tissue.
Conclusions: Colonic mucosa of UC patients demonstrates evidence of an elevation 
in genes involving cell proliferation and processing of proteins within the ER.
Exome sequencing identified a possible increased prevalence of 2 damaging TPMT
variants within the UC population, suggesting screening the UC population before 
initiation of thiopurine analogue therapy to avoid toxicity associated with these
mutations.

OBJECTIVE: S-nitrosogluthatione (GSNO), a S-nitrosothiol, is a commonly used as
nitric oxide (NO•) donor. However, its half-life is too short for a direct
therapeutic use. To protect and ensure a sustained release of NO•, the
encapsulation of GSNO into nanoparticles may be an interesting option.
METHODS: In this work, we have investigated the early (4 h) and late (24 h)
transcriptomic response of THP-1 human monocytes cells to two doses (1.4 and
6 µM) of either free or Eudragit® nano-encapsulated GSNO using RNA microarray.
RESULTS: After exposure to free GSNO, genes mainly involved in apoptosis, cell
differentiation, immune response and metabolic processes were differentially
expressed. Although, cells exposed to free or encapsulated GSNO behave
differently, activation of genes involved in blood coagulation, immune response
and cell cycle was observed in both conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the encapsulation of low doses of GSNO
into Eudragit® nanoparticles leads to a progressive release of GSNO making this
compound a possible oral therapy for several biomedical applications like
inflammatory bowel diseases.

Chronic inflammation is involved in the development of colon cancer by inducing
mutations and aberrant DNA methylation in colon epithelial cells. Furthermore,
there is growing evidence that colonic microbiota modulates the inflammation
response in the host and influences colon tumorigenesis. However, the influence
of colonic microbiota on aberrant DNA methylation remains unknown. Here, we show 
the effect of colonic microbes on DNA methylation and tumorigenicity using a
mouse model of human ulcerative colitis. Mice treated with azoxymethane (AOM) and
dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) showed an increase in degree of colitis, as
estimated by body weight, occult blood, and stool consistency/diarrhea at 2 weeks
after treatment, but treatment with antibiotics markedly reduced the severity of 
the colitis. Although mucosal hyperplasia and increased inflammation-related
genes were observed in the colonic epithelial cells of the AOM/DSS-treated mice, 
treatment with antibiotics abrogated these changes. In addition, treatment with
antibiotics significantly decreased the number of mucosal nodules from 5.9 ± 5.3 
to 0.2 ± 0.6 (P < .01) and area of occupancy from 50.1 ± 57.4 to 0.5 ± 1.4 mm2
(P < .01). Aberrant DNA methylation of three marker CpG islands (Cbln4, Fosb, and
Msx1) was induced by AOM/DSS treatment in colonic mucosae, but this increase was 
suppressed by 50%-92% (P < .05) with antibiotic treatment. Microbiome analysis
showed that this change was associated with a decrease of the Clostridium leptum 
subgroup. These data indicate that antibiotics suppressed tumorigenesis through
inhibition of aberrant DNA methylation induced by chronic inflammation.

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), encompassing both Crohn Disease (CD) and
ulcerative colitis (UC) are globally prevalent diseases, impacting children of
all ages. The hallmark of IBD is a perturbed immune system that leads to
continuous inflammation in the gut and challenges optimal treatment. Nuclear
factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κβ), a nuclear
transcription factor, plays a major role in gut homeostasis and contributes
significantly toward a balanced, homeostatic immune system. Dysregulation in the 
NF-κβ pathway and factors that regulate it lead to a state of uncontrolled
inflammation and altered immunity, as typically observed in IBD. Levels of
proinflammatory cytokines that are regulated through NF-κβ are increased in both 
CD and UC. Genes known to activate NF-κβ, such as, Nucleotide-binding
oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) and Interleukin 23 (IL-23),
are associated with IBD. Factors involved in inhibition of NF-κβ, such as A20 and
TOLLIP, are also affected in IBD, resulting in failed inflammation
suppression/regulation. NOD-2 and A20 have specifically been found to be strongly
associated with pediatric IBD. Gut commensals are known to exert
anti-inflammatory activities toward NF-κβ and can have a potential role in
attenuating inflammation that likely occurs due to microbial dysbiosis in IBD.
Failure to terminate/downregulate NF-κβ signaling results in chronic inflammation
in IBD. Well-regulated control of inflammation in children with IBD can help
better control the disease and suppress immune responses. Better understanding of
factors that control NF-κβ can potentially lead toward discovering targeted
therapeutic interventions for IBD. Suppression of NF-κβ can be achieved through
many modalities including anti-sense oligonucleotides (ASOs), siRNA (small
interfering RNA), factors regulating NF-κβ, and microbes. This review focuses on 
the role of NF-κβ, especially in pediatric IBD, and potential therapeutic venues 
for attenuating NF-κβ-induced inflammation.

Recent advance in very early-onset inflammatory bowel disease.

Recent studies on pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have revealed that
early-onset IBD has distinct phenotypic differences compared with adult-onset
IBD. In particular, very early-onset IBD (VEO-IBD) differs in many aspects,
including the disease type, location of the lesions, disease behavior, and
genetically attributable risks. Neonatal or infantile-onset IBD develops in less 
than 1% of pediatric patients. Children with infantile-onset IBD have high rates 
of affected first-degree relatives and severe disease course. The suspicion of a 
monogenic cause of VEO-IBD was first confirmed by the discovery of mutations in
the genes encoding the interleukin 10 (IL-10) receptors that cause impaired IL-10
signaling. Patients with such mutations typically presented with perianal
fistulae, shows a poor response to medical management, and require early surgical
interventions in the first year of life. To date, 60 monogenic defects have been 
identified in children with IBD-like phenotypes. The majority of monogenic
defects presents before 6 years of age, and many present before 1 year of age.
Next generation sequencing could become an important diagnostic tool in children 
with suspected genetic defects especially in children with VEO-IBD with severe
disease phenotypes. VEO-IBD is a phenotypically and genetically distinct disease 
entity from adult-onset or older pediatric IBD.

Genetic research has shaped the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) landscape
identifying nearly two hundred risk loci. Nonetheless, the identified variants
rendered only a partial success in providing criteria for the differential
diagnosis between ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Transcript
levels from affected intestinal mucosa may serve as tentative biomarkers for
improving classification and diagnosis of IBD. The aim of our study was to
identify gene expression profiles specific for UC and CD, in endoscopically
affected and normal intestinal colonic mucosa from IBD patients. We evaluated a
panel of 84 genes related to the IBD-inflammatory pathway on 21 UC and 22 CD
paired inflamed and not inflamed mucosa and on age-matched normal mucosa from 21 
non-IBD controls. Two genes in UC (CCL11 and MMP10) and two in CD (C4BPB and
IL1RN) showed an upregulation trend in both noninflamed and inflamed mucosa
compared to controls. Our results suggest that the transcript levels of CCL11,
MMP10, C4BPB, and IL1RN are candidate biomarkers that could help in clinical
practice for the differential diagnosis between UC and CD and could guide new
research on future therapeutic targets.

Cytosolic delivery is the major challenge that limits the clinical translation of
siRNA-based therapeutics. Although thousands of polymers have been developed for 
siRNA delivery, the efficiency-toxicity correlation is unsatisfactory. Here, we
report a facile strategy to fabricate core-shell-structured nanoparticles with
robust siRNA delivery efficiency. The nanoparticle is prepared by entropy-driven 
complexation of siRNA with a green tea catechin to yield a negatively charged
core, followed by coating low-molecular-weight polymers to form the shell. This
supramolecular strategy facilitates the polymers condensing siRNA into uniform
nanoparticles. The nanoparticle specifically down-regulates target genes in vitro
and in vivo, and efficiently attenuates chronic intestinal inflammation in an
inflammatory bowel disease model. Notably, the highly efficient nanoparticles are
applicable for various polymers with different topologies and chemical
compositions, providing a versatile technique to break down the
efficiency-toxicity correlation of cationic polymers. The proposed strategy in
this study permits the development of a promising platform for polymer-mediated
siRNA delivery.

Background/Aims: Intestinal barrier dysfunction is a hallmark of inflammatory
bowel diseases (IBDs) such as ulcerative colitis. This dysfunction is caused by
increased permeability and the loss of tight junctions in intestinal epithelial
cells. The aim of this study was to investigate whether estradiol treatment
reduces colonic permeability, tight junction disruption, and inflammation in an
azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) colon cancer mouse model.
Methods: The effects of 17β-estradiol (E2) were evaluated in ICR male mice 4
weeks after AOM/DSS treatment. Histological damage was scored by hematoxylin and 
eosin staining and the levels of the colonic mucosal cytokine myeloperoxidase
(MPO) were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). To evaluate the
effects of E2 on intestinal permeability, tight junctions, and inflammation, we
performed quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot
analysis. Furthermore, the expression levels of mucin 2 (MUC2) and mucin 4 (MUC4)
were measured as target genes for intestinal permeability, whereas zonula
occludens 1 (ZO-1), occludin (OCLN), and claudin 4 (CLDN4) served as target genes
for the tight junctions.
Results: The colitis-mediated induced damage score and MPO activity were reduced 
by E2 treatment (p＜0.05). In addition, the mRNA expression levels of intestinal
barrier-related molecules (i.e., MUC2, ZO-1, OCLN, and CLDN4) were decreased by
AOM/DSS-treatment; furthermore, this inhibition was rescued by E2
supplementation. The mRNA and protein expression of inflammation-related genes
(i.e., KLF4, NF-κB, iNOS, and COX-2) was increased by AOM/DSS-treatment and
ameliorated by E2.
Conclusions: E2 acts through the estrogen receptor β signaling pathway to elicit 
anti-inflammatory effects on intestinal barrier by inducing the expression of
MUC2 and tight junction molecules and inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines.

Background and Aims: The intestinal epithelium of inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD) patients is exposed to various pro-inflammatory cytokines, most notably
TNF-α. We have previously shown that the Notch signalling pathway is also
up-regulated in such an epithelium, contributing to intestinal epithelial cell
(IEC) proliferation and regeneration. We aimed to reproduce such environment in
vitro and explore the gene regulation involved.
Methods: Human IEC cell lines or patient-derived organoids were used to analyse
Notch- and TNF-α-dependent gene expression. Immunohistochemistry was performed to
analyse expression of ubiquitin D (UBD) in various patient-derived intestinal
tissues.
Results: In human IEC cell lines, we found that Notch signalling and
TNF-α-induced NFB signalling are reciprocally regulated to promote expression of 
a specific gene subset. Global gene expression analysis identified UBD to be one 
of the most highly up-regulated genes due to synergy of Notch and TNF-α. The
synergistic expression of UBD was regulated at the transcriptional level, whereas
the UBD protein had an extremely short half-life due to post-translational,
proteasomal degradation. In uninflamed intestinal tissues from IBD patients, UBD 
expression was limited to IECs residing at the crypt bottom. In contrast,
UBD-expressing IECs were seen throughout the crypt in inflamed tissues,
indicating substantial induction by the local inflammatory environment. Analysis 
using patient-derived organoids consistently confirmed conserved Notch- and
TNF-α-dependent expression of UBD. Notably, post-infliximab (IFX) down-regulation
of UBD reflected favourable outcome in IBD patients.
Conclusion: We propose that UBD is a novel inflammatory-phase protein expressed
in IECs, with a highly rapid responsiveness to anti-TNF-α treatment.

AIM: To analyze the distribution of SLC6A4 gene polymorphisms in Crohn's disease 
(CD) patients and their association with the disease.
METHODS: We evaluated the presence/absence of promoter (5-HTTLPR, rs25531) and
intron 2 (STin2 VNTR) polymorphic variants of SLC6A4 gene in a retrospective
case-control study including 192 CD patients and 157 healthy controls (HC).
Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction. The association of
polymorphisms with CD and its clinical subtypes was analyzed using χ2 and Fisher 
exact test, binary logistic regression, and haplotype analysis.
RESULTS: CD patients and healthy controls had similar sex (88 [45.8%] vs 84
[53.5%] women, respectively; P=0.154) and age (41.3±12.8 years vs 41.7±8.8 years,
respectively, P=0.091) distribution. Significant differences were observed in the
STin2 genotype and allele distribution between CD patients and healthy controls
(P=0.003 and P=0.002, respectively) and between the corresponding female
subgroups (P=0.004 and P=0.007, respectively), with a significant negative
association of biallelic ss (STin2.9 and Stin2.10) STin2 genotype with CD
(P=0.013, age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.5, 95% confidence interval [CI]
0.29-0.86; women: P=0.006, age-adjusted OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.14-0.72) and a
significantly higher S-STin2.12 (5-HTTLPR/rs25531: S-STin2: STin2.12) haplotype
distribution in CD patients (P=0.004, OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.16-2.26). There was no
significant association between 5-HTTLRP and rs25531 genotype or allele
frequencies and CD and between any SLC6A4 polymorphic loci with clinical CD
subtypes.
CONCLUSION: STin2 VNTR polymorphism of SLC6A4 gene may contribute to CD
pathogenesis.

Mast cells are typically linked to immediate hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis.
This review looks beyond this narrow role, focusing on how these cells have
evolved and diversified via natural selection promoting serine protease gene
duplication, augmenting their innate host defense function against helminths and 
snake envenomation. Plasticity of mast cell genes has come at a price. Somatic
activating mutations in the mast cell growth factor KIT gene cause cutaneous
mastocytosis in young children and systemic mastocytosis with a more guarded
prognosis in adults who may also harbor other gene mutations with oncogenic
potential as they age. Allelic TPSAB1 gene duplication associated with higher
basal mast cell tryptase is possibly one of the commonest autosomal dominantly
inherited multi-system diseases affecting the skin, gastrointestinal tract,
circulation and musculoskeletal system. Mast cells are also establishing a
new-found importance in severe asthma, and in remodeling of blood vessels in
cancer and atherosclerotic vascular disease. Furthermore, recent evidence
suggests that mast cells sense changes in oxygen tension, particularly in
neonates, and that subsequent degranulation may contribute to common lung, eye,
and brain diseases of prematurity classically associated with hypoxic insults.
One hundred and forty years since Paul Ehrlich's initial description of
"mastzellen," this review collates and highlights the complex and diverse roles
that mast cells play in health and disease.

Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4), mainly present in immune cells, epithelial cells, and
brain cells, manifests as an intracellular non-receptor enzyme that modulates
inflammation and epithelial integrity. Inhibition of PDE4 is predicted to have
diverse effects via the elevation of the level of cyclic adenosine monophosphate 
(cAMP) and the subsequent regulation of a wide array of genes and proteins. It
has been identified that PDE4 is a promising therapeutic target for the treatment
of diverse pulmonary, dermatological, and severe neurological diseases. Over the 
past decades, numerous PDE4 inhibitors have been designed and synthesized, among 
which roflumilast, apremilast, and crisaborole were approved for the treatment of
inflammatory airway diseases, psoriatic arthritis, and atopic dermatitis,
respectively. It is regrettable that the dramatic efficacies of a drug are often 
accompanied by adverse effects, such as nausea, emesis, and gastrointestinal
reactions. However, substantial advances have been made to mitigate the adverse
effects and obtain better benefit-to-risk ratio. This review highlights the
dialectical role of PDE4 in drug discovery and the disquisitive details of
certain PDE4 inhibitors to provide an overview of the topics that still need to
be addressed in the future.

BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of inflammatory
conditions characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI)
tract. Recent preclinical and clinical studies have shown the therapeutic value
of photodynamic therapy with low doses of photosensitizer and/or light in colitis
treatment, but the detailed mechanism is unclear.
METHODS: We examined 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) mediated photodynamic therapy 
(PDT) in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. Endoscopic and
macroscopic observations as well as the Disease Activity Index score (DAI) was
used to monitor the disease. Cytokine expression was measured by quantitative
RT-PCR analysis to evaluate the efficacy of PDT. We applied the Clariom™ D
bioinformatics analysis to investigate the differentially expressed genes after
PDT. Finally, we used quantitative RT-PCR analysis and Western blotting to
validate the targets of differentially expressed genes.
RESULTS: 5-ALA-PDT improved the DAI score and decreased the expression of various
inflammatory cytokines. The Clariom™ D bioinformatics analysis identified 2043
diﬀ ;erentially expressed genes (702 up-regulated and 1341 down-regulated). We
confirmed the down-regulation of lncRNA-Neat1, lncRNA-Snhg5 and lncRNA-Gm9926 and
the up-regulation of miRNA-204-5p, miRNA-218-5p, miRNA-200a-3p and miRNA-466h-5p.
Additionally, the decreased expression level of the AKT3, p-AKT3, PI3K, p-PI3K
protein were confirmed.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides in vivo comprehensive lncRNA and miRNA
microarray analysis after 5-ALA-PDT treatment in DSS-induced colitis, and it may 
help to develop novel lncRNA-miRNA-related therapeutic approaches, such as the
Neat1-miRNA204-5p-PI3K-AKT axis, to further increase the efficiency of PDT in
IBD.

Loss of gut integrity is linked to various human diseases including inflammatory 
bowel disease. However, the mechanisms that lead to loss of barrier function
remain poorly understood. Using D. melanogaster, we demonstrate that dietary
restriction (DR) slows the age-related decline in intestinal integrity by
enhancing enterocyte cellular fitness through up-regulation of dMyc in the
intestinal epithelium. Reduction of dMyc in enterocytes induced cell death, which
leads to increased gut permeability and reduced lifespan upon DR. Genetic mosaic 
and epistasis analyses suggest that cell competition, whereby neighboring cells
eliminate unfit cells by apoptosis, mediates cell death in enterocytes with
reduced levels of dMyc. We observed that enterocyte apoptosis was necessary for
the increased gut permeability and shortened lifespan upon loss of dMyc.
Furthermore, moderate activation of dMyc in the post-mitotic enteroblasts and
enterocytes was sufficient to extend health-span on rich nutrient diets. We
propose that dMyc acts as a barometer of enterocyte cell fitness impacting
intestinal barrier function in response to changes in diet and age.

Mutations in interleukin-10 receptor (IL-10R) genes are one cause of very
early-onset inflammatory bowel disease with perianal lesions, which can be cured 
by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Using a functional test, which
assesses responsiveness of peripheral monocytes to IL-10, we identified three
unrelated Portuguese patients carrying two novel IL-10RB mutations. In the three 
patients, sequencing of genomic DNA identified the same large deletion of exon 3 
which precluded protein expression. This mutation was homozygous in two patients 
born from consanguineous families and heterozygous in the third patient born from
unrelated parents. Microsatellite analysis of the IL10RB genomic region revealed 
a common haplotype in the three Portuguese families pointing to a founder
deletion inherited from a common ancestor 400 years ago. In the third patient,
surface expression of IL-10R was normal but signaling in response to IL-10 was
impaired. Complementary DNA sequencing and next-generation sequencing of IL10RB
locus with custom-made probes revealed a ≈ 6 Kb duplication encompassing the exon
6 which leads to a frameshift mutation and a loss of the TYK2-interacting Box 2
motif. Altogether, we describe two novel copy number variations in IL10RB, one
with founder effect and one preserving cell surface expression but abolishing
signaling.

Mutations in genes encoding subunits of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase complex are
recognized to cause chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), a severe primary
immunodeficiency. Here we describe how deficiency of CYBC1, a previously
uncharacterized protein in humans (C17orf62), leads to reduced expression of
NADPH oxidase's main subunit (gp91phox) and results in CGD. Analyzing two
brothers diagnosed with CGD we identify a homozygous loss-of-function mutation,
p.Tyr2Ter, in CYBC1. Imputation of p.Tyr2Ter into 155K chip-genotyped Icelanders 
reveals six additional homozygotes, all with signs of CGD, manifesting as
colitis, rare infections, or a severely impaired PMA-induced neutrophil oxidative
burst. Homozygosity for p.Tyr2Ter consequently associates with inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD) in Iceland (P = 8.3 × 10-8; OR = 67.6), as well as reduced height
(P = 3.3 × 10-4; -8.5 cm). Overall, we find that CYBC1 deficiency results in CGD 
characterized by colitis and a distinct profile of infections indicative of
macrophage dysfunction.

Functional characterization of the noncoding genome is essential for biological
understanding of gene regulation and disease. Here, we introduce the
computational framework PINES (Phenotype-Informed Noncoding Element Scoring),
which predicts the functional impact of noncoding variants by integrating
epigenetic annotations in a phenotype-dependent manner. PINES enables analyses to
be customized towards genomic annotations from cell types of the highest
relevance given the phenotype of interest. We illustrate that PINES identifies
functional noncoding variation more accurately than methods that do not use
phenotype-weighted knowledge, while at the same time being flexible and easy to
use via a dedicated web portal.

Background: Few studies have investigated the blood proteome of inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD). We characterized the serum abundance of proteins encoded at 
163 known IBD risk loci and tested these proteins for their biomarker discovery
potential.
Methods: Based on the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) antibody availability, 218
proteins from genes mapping at 163 IBD risk loci were selected. Targeted serum
protein profiles from 49 Crohn's disease (CD) patients, 51 ulcerative colitis
(UC) patients, and 50 sex- and age-matched healthy individuals were obtained
using multiplexed antibody suspension bead array assays. Differences in relative 
serum abundance levels between disease groups and controls were examined.
Replication was attempted for CD-UC comparisons (including disease subtypes) by
including 64 additional patients (33 CD and 31 UC). Antibodies targeting a
potentially novel risk protein were validated by paired antibodies, Western blot,
immuno-capture mass spectrometry, and epitope mapping.
Results: By univariate analysis, 13 proteins mostly related to neutrophil,
T-cell, and B-cell activation and function were differentially expressed in IBD
patients vs healthy controls, 3 in CD patients vs healthy controls and 2 in UC
patients vs healthy controls (q < 0.01). Multivariate analyses further
differentiated disease groups from healthy controls and CD subtypes from UC (P < 
0.05). Extended characterization of an antibody targeting a novel, discriminative
serum marker, the laccase (multicopper oxidoreductase) domain containing 1
(LACC1) protein, provided evidence for antibody on-target specificity.
Conclusions: Using affinity proteomics, we identified a set of IBD-associated
serum proteins encoded at IBD risk loci. These candidate proteins hold the
potential to be exploited as diagnostic biomarkers of IBD.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease that targets pancreatic islet beta
cells and incorporates genetic and environmental factors1, including complex
genetic elements2, patient exposures3 and the gut microbiome4. Viral infections5 
and broader gut dysbioses6 have been identified as potential causes or
contributing factors; however, human studies have not yet identified microbial
compositional or functional triggers that are predictive of islet autoimmunity or
T1D. Here we analyse 10,913 metagenomes in stool samples from 783 mostly white,
non-Hispanic children. The samples were collected monthly from three months of
age until the clinical end point (islet autoimmunity or T1D) in the The
Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study, to
characterize the natural history of the early gut microbiome in connection to
islet autoimmunity, T1D diagnosis, and other common early life events such as
antibiotic treatments and probiotics. The microbiomes of control children
contained more genes that were related to fermentation and the biosynthesis of
short-chain fatty acids, but these were not consistently associated with
particular taxa across geographically diverse clinical centres, suggesting that
microbial factors associated with T1D are taxonomically diffuse but functionally 
more coherent. When we investigated the broader establishment and development of 
the infant microbiome, both taxonomic and functional profiles were dynamic and
highly individualized, and dominated in the first year of life by one of three
largely exclusive Bifidobacterium species (B. bifidum, B. breve or B. longum) or 
by the phylum Proteobacteria. In particular, the strain-specific carriage of
genes for the utilization of human milk oligosaccharide within a subset of B.
longum was present specifically in breast-fed infants. These analyses of TEDDY
gut metagenomes provide, to our knowledge, the largest and most detailed
longitudinal functional profile of the developing gut microbiome in relation to
islet autoimmunity, T1D and other early childhood events. Together with existing 
evidence from human cohorts7,8 and a T1D mouse model9, these data support the
protective effects of short-chain fatty acids in early-onset human T1D.

OBJECTIVE: Activating mutations in the GUCY2C gene, which encodes the epithelial 
receptor guanylate cyclase C, cause diarrhea due to increased loss of sodium
chloride to the intestinal lumen. Patients with familial GUCY2C diarrhea syndrome
(FGDS) are predisposed to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We investigated
whether genes in the guanylate cyclase C pathway are enriched for association
with IBD and reversely whether genetic or transcriptional changes associated with
IBD are found in FGDS patients.
METHODS: (1) A set of 27 genes from the guanylate cyclase C pathway was tested
for enrichment of association with IBD by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, using
genome-wide association summary statistics from 12,882 IBD patients and 21,770
controls. (2) We genotyped 163 known IBD risk loci and sequenced NOD2 in 22
patients with FGDS. Eight of them had concomitant Crohn's disease. (3) Global
gene expression analysis was performed in ileal tissue from patients with FGDS,
Crohn's disease and healthy individuals.
RESULTS: The guanylate cyclase C gene set showed a significant enrichment of
association in IBD genome-wide association data. Risk variants in NOD2 were found
in 7/8 FGDS patients with concomitant Crohn's disease and in 2/14 FDGS patients
without Crohn's disease. In ileal tissue, downregulation of metallothioneins
characterized FGDS patients compared to healthy controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support a role of guanylate cyclase C signaling and
disturbed electrolyte homeostasis in development of IBD. Furthermore,
downregulation of metallothioneins in the ileal mucosa of FGDS patients may
contribute to IBD development, possibly alongside effects from NOD2 risk
variants.

Microflora dysbiosis is implicated in the pathophysiology of Crohn's disease.
This work analyzes differences in microbial communities and relevant metabolic
pathways among the nonstricturing nonpenetrating (B1), stricturing (B2), and
penetrating (B3) subphenotypes of Crohn's disease vs healthy controls. We
conducted a bioinformatics analysis using the QIIME pipeline and the Calypso,
linear discriminant analysis effect size, Phylogenetic Investigation of
Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States, and STAMP tools on publicly
available 16S bacterial rRNA sequencing data from terminal ileum mucosal biopsies
of healthy controls and the 3 subphenotypes of Crohn's disease. We analyzed
differences in microbial diversity and taxonomy, inferred active metabolic
pathways via relevant genes' abundance, and detected bacterial families that
could serve as biomarkers. Microbiota α-diversity was decreased within all 3
Crohn's disease subphenotypes vs control samples, with more significant
reductions in B2 and B3 compared with B1. β-diversity analysis identified similar
microbial patterns in B2 and B3 samples, different from those of B1 and from
those of healthy controls. Abundance analysis of microbial families in cohorts,
beyond altered abundances compared with healthy controls, highlighted significant
differences between the B2 and B3 subphenotypes and the B1 subphenotype. A
similar pattern was observed in the inference of microbial metabolomics: the B2
and B3 cohorts had different predicted metabolotypes from the B1 cohort, in
addition to differences observed in Crohn's disease vs healthy controls. Our
findings indicate distinct microbiome signatures in complicated Crohn's disease
subphenotypes and provide the basis for further investigation into the role of
gut microflora in the natural course of Crohn's disease.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: There is a heterogeneous subset innate myeloid cells, such as
macrophages and dendritic cells, in the human intestinal lamina propria. Several 
studies have demonstrated that these cells contribute to the maintenance of gut
homeostasis through the induction of inflammatory responses and tolerance via
cell type-specific mechanisms; whereas, disrupted innate immune responses are
implicated in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). However, the detailed
mechanisms by which each innate myeloid subset regulates gut homeostasis and
inflammation largely remain unknown. We aimed to clarify the comprehensive gene
expression profiles of innate myeloid cell -subsets in the lamina propria from
normal human colons (NC) and the inflamed colon sites from patients with Crohn's 
disease (CDi).
METHODS: We performed RNA-sequencing analysis and precise bioinformatics analysis
on 3 innate myeloid cell subsets, CD14-CD11c-, CD14-CD11c+, and
CD14+CD11c+CD163low cells from NC and CDi.
RESULTS: Transcriptional analysis of the 3 subsets from the NC showed distinct
gene expression patterns and gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed the 
associated innate myeloid subset-specific biological process (BP) terms. In
addition, changes in gene expression patterns were observed in innate myeloid
subsets from CDi. Furthermore, the core GO-BP terms for the genes upregulated in 
the innate myeloid cells from CDi were distinct from those found in NC.
CONCLUSION: Our data identified the innate myeloid cell subset-specific
transcriptomes and the associated enriched GO-BP terms in the NC and found these 
patterns were altered in CDi.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a multifactorial disease involving defective 
immune responses against invasive microbiota. Genes associated with innate immune
responses to microbes have been highlighted in the pathogenesis of IBD. To
determine the role of Rab32 in the pathogenesis of IBD, we administered dextran
sodium sulfate (DSS) to CD11c+ cell-specific Rab32 knockout (CD11c-Cre+Rab32f/f) 
mice to induce colitis. Rab32 deficiency in CD11c+ cells resulted in more severe 
disease progression and increased mortality. Histopathological analysis showed
extensive damage to the colon mucosa in DSS-treated CD11c-Cre+Rab32f/f mice,
including more severe damage to the epithelial layer and crypts, as well as more 
inflammatory cell infiltration. The pro-inflammatory cytokines IL1A, IL1B, IL6,
and CSF3 and chemokines CXCL1 and CXCL2 were significantly increased, and the
frequency of CD11b+Ly6G+ neutrophils was higher in CD11c-Cre+Rab32f/f colitis
mice. Furthermore, CD11c+ cells deficient for Rab32 exhibited a significant
increase in bacterial translocation in inflamed colon tissue. The present data
demonstrate that Rab32 knockout in CD11c+ cells aggravates the development of
DSS-induced colitis and suggest that the Rab32-related antimicrobial pathway is
involved in the pathogenesis of IBD.

50% of Caucasians carry a Thr300Ala variant (T300A) in the protein encoded by the
macroautophagy/autophagy gene ATG16L1. Here, we show that the T300A variant
confers protection against urinary tract infections (UTIs), the most common
infectious disease in women. Using knockin mice carrying the human T300A variant,
we show that the variant limits the UTI-causing bacteria, uropathogenic
Escherichia coli (UPEC), from establishing persistent intracellular reservoirs,
which can seed UTI recurrence. This phenotype is recapitulated in mice lacking
Atg16l1 or Atg7 exclusively in the urothelium. We further show that mice with the
T300A variant exhibit urothelial cellular abnormalities, including vesicular
congestion and aberrant accumulation of UPK (uroplakin) proteins. Importantly,
presence of the T300A variant in humans is associated with similar urothelial
architectural abnormalities, indicating an evolutionarily conserved impact.
Mechanistically, we show that the reduced bacterial persistence is independent of
basal autophagic flux or proinflammatory cytokine responses and does not involve 
Atg14 or Epg5. However, the T300A variant is associated with increased expression
of the small GTPase Rab33b; RAB33B interacts with ATG16L1, as well as other
secretory RABs, RAB27B and RAB11A, important for UPEC exocytosis from the
urothelium. Finally, inhibition of secretory RABs in bladder epithelial cells
increases intracellular UPEC load. Together, our results reveal that UPEC
selectively utilize genes important for autophagosome formation to persist in the
urothelium, and that the presence of the T300A variant in ATG16L1 is associated

Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal disorder. Genetic
association studies have implicated dysregulated autophagy in CD. Among risk loci
identified are a promoter single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)( rs13361189 ) and 
two intragenic SNPs ( rs9637876 , rs10065172 ) in immunity-related GTPase family 
M ( IRGM) a gene that encodes a protein of the autophagy initiation complex. All 
three SNPs have been proposed to modify IRGM expression, but reports have been
divergent and largely derived from cell lines. Here, analyzing RNA-Sequencing
data of human tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project, we found that 
rs13361189 minor allele carriers had reduced IRGM expression in whole blood and
terminal ileum, and upregulation in ileum of ZNF300P1, a locus adjacent to IRGM
on chromosome 5q33.1 that encodes a long noncoding RNA. Whole blood and ileum
from minor allele carriers had altered expression of multiple additional genes
that have previously been linked to colitis and/or autophagy. Notable among these
was an increase in ileum of LTF (lactoferrin), an established fecal inflammatory 
biomarker of CD, and in whole blood of TNF, a key cytokine in CD pathogenesis.
Last, we confirmed that risk alleles at all three loci associated with increased 
risk for CD but not ulcerative colitis in a case-control study. Taken together,
our findings suggest that genetically encoded IRGM deficiency may predispose to
CD through dysregulation of inflammatory gene networks. Gene expression profiling
of disease target tissues in genetically susceptible populations is a promising
strategy for revealing new leads for the study of molecular pathogenesis and,
potentially, for precision medicine. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Single nucleotide
polymorphisms in immunity-related GTPase family M ( IRGM), a gene that encodes an
autophagy initiation protein, have been linked epidemiologically to increased
risk for Crohn's disease (CD). Here, we show for the first time that subjects
with risk alleles at two such loci, rs13361189 and rs10065172 , have reduced IRGM
expression in whole blood and terminal ileum, as well as dysregulated expression 
of a wide array of additional genes that regulate inflammation and autophagy.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a persistent inflammatory illness, which is clinically
categorised as Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), affecting millions of people
worldwide. The precise cause behind the pathology of the disease remains unknown.
However, the involvement of multiple factors including genetic predisposition,
immunological deregulations, microbiota imbalance, and environmental triggers has
been suggested. Amongst all these factors, the over-active immunological response
reported in UC patients seems to be a promising target for therapy. Moreover,
identification of gene signatures associated with disease onset and progression
would help in better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the
disease pathogenesis. Here, we have conducted meta-analysis of gene expression
profiles of UC patient microarray datasets accessible in public databases and
further validated the in-silico findings in UC patients' blood samples. Our study
reveals that UC pathogenesis perturbs expression of several inflammatory genes.
In addition, we report a novel gene signature comprising of TIA1 (T cell
restricted intracellular antigen) and TIAR (TIA1 related protein; also known as
TIAL1), which were found to be significantly downregulated in UC patients. TIA1
and TIAR are RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), which function as a translational
represser by binding to ARE sequences in the 3' UTR of mRNAs encoding
inflammatory mediators including cytokines. Our findings demonstrate that
deletion of TIAR using gene specific siRNAs in-vitro results in enhanced
production of inflammatory cytokine IL-1β. In conclusion, the findings of this
study reveal that down regulation of TIA1/TIAR genes could be responsible for UC 
associated inflammation. This study highlights the usefulness of the
meta-analysis approach in the identification of unique gene signatures that might
deliver mechanistic insights into UC pathogenesis and possibly assist in
discovery of prognostic markers and therapeutic interventions.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: The CYLD lysine 63 deubiquitinase gene (CYLD) encodes tumor
suppressor protein that is mutated in familial cylindromatosus, and variants have
been associated with Crohn disease (CD). Splice forms of CYLD that lack exons 7
and 8 regulate transcription factors and functions of immune cells. We examined
the expression of splice forms of CYLD in colon tissues from patients with CD and
their effects in mice.
METHODS: We performed immunohistochemical analyses of colon tissues from patients
with untreated CD and patients without inflammatory bowel diseases (controls). We
obtained mice that expressed splice forms of CYLD (sCYLD mice) without or with
SMAD7 (sCYLD/SMAD7 mice) from transgenes and CYLD-knockout mice (with or without 
transgenic expression of SMAD7) and performed endoscopic analyses. Colitis was
induced in Rag1-/- mice by transfer of CD4+ CD62L+ T cells from C57/Bl6 or
transgenic mice. T cells were isolated from mice and analyzed by flow cytometry
and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and intestinal tissues were 
analyzed by histology and immunohistochemistry. CYLD forms were expressed in
mouse embryonic fibroblasts, primary T cells, and HEK293T cells, which were
analyzed by immunoblot, mobility shift, and immunoprecipitation assays.
RESULTS: The colonic lamina propria from patients with CD was infiltrated by T
cells and had higher levels of sCYLD (but not full-length CYLD) and SMAD7 than
tissues from controls. Incubation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts and T cells with
transforming growth factor β increased their production of sCYLD and decreased
full-length CYLD. Transgenic expression of sCYLD and SMAD7 in T cells prevented
the differentiation of regulatory T cells and T-helper type 17 cells and
increased the differentiation of T-helper type 1 cells. The same effects were
observed in colon tissues from sCYLD/SMAD7 mice but not in those from
CYLD-knockout SMAD7 mice. The sCYLD mice had significant increases in the numbers
of T-helper type 1 cells and CD44high CD62Llow memory-effector CD4+ T cells in
the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes compared with wild-type mice; sCYLD/SMAD7
mice had even larger increases. The sCYLD/SMAD7 mice spontaneously developed
severe colitis, with infiltration of the colon by dendritic cells, neutrophils,
macrophages, and CD4+ T cells and increased levels of Ifng, Il6, Il12a, Il23a,
and Tnf mRNAs. Co-transfer of regulatory T cells from wild-type, but not from
sCYLD/SMAD7, mice prevented the induction of colitis in Rag1-/- mice by CD4+ T
cells. We found increased levels of poly-ubiquitinated SMAD7 in sCYLD CD4+ T
cells. CYLD formed a nuclear complex with SMAD3, whereas sCYLD recruited SMAD7 to
the nucleus, which inhibited the expression of genes regulated by SMAD3 and
SMAD4. We found that sCYLD mediated lysine 63-linked ubiquitination of SMAD7. The
sCYLD-SMAD7 complex inhibited transforming growth factor β signaling in CD4+ T
cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Levels of the spliced form of CYLD are increased in colon tissues
from patients with CD. sCYLD mediates ubiquitination and nuclear translocation of
SMAD7 and thereby decreases transforming growth factor β signaling in T cells.
This prevents immune regulatory mechanisms and leads to colitis in mice.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Increased oxidative stress and decreased immune cell apoptosis
have been reported to be important factors in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease
(CD). Our aim was to characterize the genetic expression of molecules implicated 
in the regulation of oxidative stress and apoptosis in peripheral white
mononuclear cells of 18 healthy volunteers (controls) and 20 patients at the
onset of CD (active CD [aCD]): 10 who achieved remission (inactive CD [iCD]) and 
10 who did not present a complete and deep response to treatment (aCD-T).
METHODS: mRNA expression was measured by the Agena MassARRAY quantitative gene
expression analysis application. The genes analyzed were Fas-receptor (FASR),
Fas-ligand (FASL), signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1),
nuclear factor kappa-light-chain--enhancer of activated B cells (NFKB1),
apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), serine/threonine-protein kinase H1
(PSKH1), ATP-binding cassette sub-family B1 (ABCB1) and peptidylprolyl isomerase 
D (PPID).
RESULTS: During a CD flare, we found specific upregulated expression of the genes
STAT1 and PSKH1, whereas ABCB1 and FASL were downregulated. In the patients with 
iCD, FASR and NFKB1 were upregulated. The expression levels of NFKB1, STAT1 and
ABCB1 did not show any difference in patients with aCD at the onset of the
disease and after treatment (aCD-T). The expression levels of PPID and ASK1 did
not show any differences in the patients with aCD, iCD and the controls. We have 
also reviewed the cellular function and role of these genes in CD.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings contribute to improving the understanding of the
pathogenesis of CD and highlight potential genes involved.

Different computational approaches are employed to efficiently identify novel
repositioning possibilities utilizing different sources of information and
algorithms. It is critical to propose high-valued candidate-repositioning
possibilities before conducting lengthy in vivo validation studies that consume
significant resources. Here we report a novel multi-methodological approach to
identify opportunities for drug repositioning. We performed analyses of
real-world data (RWD) acquired from the United States Food and Drug
Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and the claims database
maintained by the Japan Medical Data Center (JMDC). These analyses were followed 
by cross-validation through bioinformatics analyses of gene expression data.
Inverse associations revealed using disproportionality analysis (DPA) and
sequence symmetry analysis (SSA) were used to detect potential drug-repositioning
signals. To evaluate the validity of the approach, we conducted a feasibility
study to identify marketed drugs with the potential for treating inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD). Primary analyses of the FAERS and JMDC claims databases
identified psycholeptics such as haloperidol, diazepam, and hydroxyzine as
candidates that may improve the treatment of IBD. To further investigate the
mechanistic relevance between hit compounds and disease pathology, we conducted
bioinformatics analyses of the associations of the gene expression profiles of
these compounds with disease. We identified common biological features among
genes differentially expressed with or without compound treatment as well as
disease-perturbation data available from open sources, which strengthened the
mechanistic rationale of our initial findings. We further identified pathways
such as cytokine signaling that are influenced by these drugs. These pathways are
relevant to pathologies and can serve as alternative targets of therapy.
Integrative analysis of RWD such as those available from adverse-event databases,
claims databases, and transcriptome analyses represent an effective approach that
adds value to efficiently identifying potential novel therapeutic opportunities.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects 10%-20% of people. Increased numbers of
Escherichia coli (E. coli) correlate with symptoms, and patients respond to
antimicrobials targeting E. coli. We examined whether specific E. coli strains,
phylogroups and pathotypes are associated with IBS. We evaluated 218 E. coli
isolates from 33 IBS patients and 23 healthy controls. RAPD analysis revealed 89 
E. coli strains (29 controls, 60 IBS), spanning the A, B1, B2 and D phylogroups. 
Strains were similarly enriched in virulence genes associated with
extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) and/or adherent-invasive E. coli
(AIEC). Three strains harbored a diarrheagenic virulence gene (2 IBS, 1 control).
Escherichia coli capable of invading epithelial cells or replicating in
macrophages were detected in 53% of IBS and 50% controls, and 67% IBS and 45%
controls respectively (P > 0.05). AIEC were identified in 33% of IBS patients vs 
20% of controls (P = 0.35). Virulence genes ibeA, ColV and pduC were associated
with intramacrophage persistence; ibeA and ColV were associated with epithelial
invasion and AIEC pathotype (P < 0.05). IBS patients and controls are commonly
colonized by E. coli that resemble ExPEC and display pathogen-like behavior in
vitro, similar to CD-associated AIEC. The relationship of these resident
pathosymbiont E. coli to IBS warrants further investigation.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize the current understanding and recent advances on 
the genetic aetiology in the pathogenesis of very early onset inflammatory bowel 
disease (VEO-IBD).
RECENT FINDINGS: IBD is a chronic disorder of the gastrointestinal tract whose
manifestation is a result of complex interactions between genetics, environment, 
immune system and microbial flora. Over 230 IBD risk loci have been reported in
genome wide association studies but the genetic contribution of the majority of
these loci in the manifestation of IBD is very low. Patients with VEO-IBD present
with a more severe disease than older patients, characterized by poor prognosis
and failure of conventional therapy. Recent studies have reported several
monogenic diseases with high penetrance that present with IBD and IBD-like
intestinal manifestations and overlap with primary immunodeficiencies. Increasing
body of evidence supports a prominent role of genetics in the onset of VEO-IBD.
New genetic variants and diagnoses in VEO-IBD are reviewed and current challenges
in therapy with potential strategy to manage the disease are discussed.
SUMMARY: Functional analysis of the genes implicated in monogenic IBD has
increased the understanding of the underlying pathobiological mechanism of the
disease. This knowledge can be used to personalize medicine for specific
patients, improving the standard of care and quality of life.

Sex differences in immunity are well described in the literature and thought to
be mainly driven by sex hormones and sex-linked immune response genes. The
gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is one of the largest immune organs in the body and 
contains multiple immune cells in the GIT-associated lymphoid tissue, Peyer's
patches and elsewhere, which together have profound effects on local and systemic
inflammation. The GIT is colonised with microbial communities composed of
bacteria, fungi and viruses, collectively known as the GIT microbiota. The GIT
microbiota drives multiple interactions locally with immune cells that regulate
the homeostatic environment and systemically in diverse tissues. It is becoming
evident that the microbiota differs between the sexes, both in animal models and 
in humans, and these sex differences often lead to sex-dependent changes in local
GIT inflammation, systemic immunity and susceptibility to a range of inflammatory
diseases. The sexually dimorphic microbiome has been termed the 'microgenderome'.
Herein, we review the evidence for the microgenderome and contemplate the role it
plays in driving sex differences in immunity and disease susceptibility. We
further consider the impact that biological sex might play in the response to
treatments aimed at manipulating the GIT microbiota, such as prebiotics, live
biotherapeutics, (probiotics, synbiotics and bacteriotherapies) and faecal
microbial transplant. These alternative therapies hold potential in the treatment
of both psychological (e.g., anxiety, depression) and physiological (e.g.,
irritable bowel disease) disorders differentially affecting males and females.

The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has markedly increased. Our
research findings during the past showed that medicinal plant extracts and the
derived phytochemical components from Wedelia chinensis (WC) can have strong
anti-colitis activities. Here, we further identified the key component
phytochemicals from active fractions of different WC preparations (WCHA) that are
responsible for the protective effect of WCHA in colitis mice. Of the 3 major
compounds (wedelolactone, luteolin and apigenin) in this fraction, luteolin had
the highest anti-inflammatory effect in vivo. Using a next-generation sequencing 
(NGS) (e.g., RNA-seq) system to analyze the transcriptome of colorectal
cells/tissues in mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis
with/without phytochemicals treatment, luteolin was found to strongly suppress
the DSS-activated IL-17 pathway in colon tissue. In addition, co-treatment with
wedelolactone and luteolin had a synergistic effect on the expression level of
some IL-17 pathway-related genes. Interestingly, our NGS analyses also indicated 
that luteolin and wedelolactone can specifically suppress the expression of NLRP3
and NLRP1. Using a 3-dimensional cell co-culture system, we further demonstrated 
that luteolin could efficiently suppress NLRP3 expression via disruption of
IL-17A signaling in inflamed colon tissue, which also indicates the
pharmacological potential of luteolin and wedelolactone in treating IBD.

Background: TNF-like cytokine 1A (TL1A) and its functional receptor,
death-domain-receptor-3 (DR3), are multifunctional mediators of effector and
regulatory immunity. We aimed to evaluate the functional role and therapeutic
potential of TL1A/DR3 signaling in Crohn's disease-like ileitis.
Methods: Ileitis-prone SAMP1/YitFc (SAMP) and TNFΔARE/+ mice were rendered
deficient for DR3 or TL1A by microsatellite marker-assisted backcrossing.
Pathological and immunological characteristics were compared between control and 
knockout mice, and mucosal immunophenotype was analyzed by Nanostring microarray 
assay. The therapeutic effect of pharmacological TL1A neutralization was also
investigated.
Results: DR3 deficiency was associated with restoration of a homeostatic mucosal 
immunostat in SAMP mice through the regulation of several pro- and
anti-inflammatory genes. This led to suppression of effector immunity,
amelioration of ileitis severity, and compromised ability of either
unfractionated CD4+ or CD4+CD45RBhi mucosal lymphocytes to transfer ileitis to
severe combined immunodeficient mice recipients. TNF-driven ileitis was also
prevented in TNFΔARE/+xDR3-/- mice, in association with decreased expression of
the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF and IFN-γ. In contrast to DR3, TL1A was
dispensable for the development of ileitis although it affected the kinetics of
inflammation, as TNFΔARE/+xTL1A-/- demonstrated delayed onset of inflammation,
whereas administration of a neutralizing, anti-TL1A antibody ameliorated early
but not late TNFΔARE/+ ileitis.
Conclusion: We found a prominent pro-inflammatory role of DR3 in chronic ileitis,
which is only partially mediated via interaction with TL1A, raising the
possibility for additional DR3 ligands. Death-domain-receptor-3 appears to be a
master regulator of mucosal homeostasis and inflammation and may represent a
candidate therapeutic target for chronic inflammatory conditions of the bowel.

AIM: Studies have evaluated the association of miRNA-423 C>A genotyping with the 
susceptibility to various diseases such cancers, atherosclerosis and inflammatory
bowel disease but the results were contradictory. However, no studies have
reported the association between miRNA-423 rs6505162 C>A polymorphism and
susceptibility of coronary artery disease. MicroRNAs regulate expression of
multiple genes involved in atherogenesis. Therefore, we investigated the
association of microRNA-423C>T gene variations with susceptibility to coronary
artery disease.
METHODOLOGY: This study was conducted on 100 coronary artery disease patients and
117 matched healthy controls. The genotyping of the microRNA-423 rs6505162C>A was
performed by using Amplification refractory mutation system PCR method
(ARMS-PCR).
RESULTS: A significant difference was observed in the genotype distribution among
the coronary artery disease cases and sex-matched healthy controls (P=0.048). The
frequencies of all three genotypes CC, CA, AA reported in the patient's samples
were 55%, 41% and 4% and in the healthy controls samples were 55%, 41% and 4%
respectively. Our findings showed that the microRNA-423 C>A variant was
associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease in codominant model 
(OR = 1.96, 95 % CI, 1.12-3.42; RR 1.35(1.05-1.75, p=0.017) of microRNA-423CA
genotype and significant association in dominant model (OR 1.97, 95% CI
(1.14-3.39), (CA+AA vs CC) and non-significant association for recessive model
(OR=1.42, 95%CI=0.42-4.83, P=0.56, AA vs CC+CA).While, the A allele significantly
increased the risk of coronary artery disease (OR =1.56, 95 % CI, 1.03-2.37;
p=0.035) compared to C allele. Therefore, it was observed that more than 1.96,
1.97 and 1.56 fold increased risk of developing coronary artery disease.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that microRNA-423 CA genotype and A allele are
associated with an increased susceptibility to Coronary artery disease.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a complex, functional gastrointestinal disorder
characterized by chronic abdominal pain or discomfort and altered bowel habits.
Despite the global prevalence and disease burden of IBS, its underlying
pathophysiology remains unclear. Inflammation may play a pathogenic role in IBS. 
Studies have highlighted the persistence of mucosal inflammation at the
microscopic and molecular level in IBS, with increased recruitment of
enteroendocrine cells. Substantial overlaps between IBS and inflammatory bowel
disease have also been reported. This review thus aimed to discuss the body of
evidence pertaining to the presence of mucosal inflammation in IBS, its putative 
role in the disease process of IBS, and its clinical relevance. Increased mast
cell density and activity in the gut may correlate with symptoms of visceral
hypersensitivity. As evidenced by patients who develop postinfectious IBS,
infective gastroenteritis could cause systemic inflammation and altered
microbiome diversity, which in turn perpetuates a cycle of chronic, low-grade,
subclinical inflammation. Apart from mucosal inflammation, neuroinflammation is
probably involved in the pathophysiology of IBS via the "gut-brain" axis,
resulting in altered neuroendocrine pathways and glucocorticoid receptor genes.
This gives rise to an overall proinflammatory phenotype and dysregulated
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and serotonergic (5-HT) functioning, which
could, at least in part, account for the symptoms of IBS. Although a definite and
reproducible pattern of immune response has yet to be recognized, further
research into anti-inflammatories may be of clinical value.

Genetic testing has become increasingly relevant in daily clinical practice due
to the identification of susceptibility genes for several diseases. This article 
focuses on genetic testing for hereditary pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel
disease and fatty liver disease. Several genetic variants that contribute to
chronic pancreatitis development have been identified. If the individual
aetiology of chronic pancreatitis is unclear, genetic testing for common
predisposing variants should be offered. Inflammatory bowel diseases are complex 
and multifactorial disorders. However, rare mono- or oligogenic forms of disease 
exist and should be screened for, as personalized therapies can be offered to
subsets of these patients. Genetic risk factors also promote the manifestation
and progression of fatty liver disease, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular
carcinoma. In conclusion, genetic testing plays an increasing role in delineating
the pathogenesis of gastroenterological and hepatic diseases, in the
stratification of patients at risk for severe disease complications, and in the
optimization of patient care.

Insects and mammals share evolutionary conserved innate immune responses to
maintain intestinal homeostasis. We investigated whether the larvae of the
greater wax moth Galleria mellonella may be used as an experimental organism to
distinguish between symbiotic Bacteroides vulgatus and pathobiotic Escherichia
coli, which are mammalian intestinal commensals. Oral application of the symbiont
or pathobiont to G. mellonella resulted in clearly distinguishable innate immune 
responses that could be verified by analyzing similar innate immune components in
mice in vivo and in vitro. The differential innate immune responses were
initiated by the recognition of bacterial components via pattern recognition
receptors. The pathobiont detection resulted in increased expression of reactive 
oxygen and nitrogen species related genes as well as antimicrobial peptide gene
expression. In contrast, the treatment/application with symbiotic bacteria led to
weakened immune responses in both mammalian and insect models. As symbionts and
pathobionts play a crucial role in development of inflammatory bowel diseases, we
hence suggest G. mellonella as a future replacement organism in inflammatory
bowel disease research.

Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus) is a ubiquitous fungus of clinical
importance associated with development of various pulmonary diseases and allergic
hypersensitivity reactions. It is protected against environmental stress by a
cell wall that contains polysaccharides such as chitin. We previously
demonstrated that fibrinogen C domain-containing protein 1 (FIBCD1) is a
membrane-bound protein that binds chitin through a conserved S1 binding site and 
is expressed in intestinal epithelium and salivary glands. Here, we further
localized FIBCD1 protein expression at the surface of bronchial and alveolar
human lung epithelium, observed recognition of A. fumigatus cell wall with S1
site-independent recognition. We observed FIBCD1-mediated suppression of IL-8
secretion, mucin production, and transcription of genes associated with airway
inflammation and homeostasis in FIBCD1-transfected lung epithelial cells. These
modulations were generally enforced by stimulation with A. fumigatus cell wall
polysaccharides. In parallel, we demonstrated a FIBCD1-mediated modulation of
IL-8 secretion induced by TLR2,-4, and -5. Collectively, our findings support
FIBCD1 as a human lung epithelial pattern recognition receptor that recognizes
the complex A. fumigatus cell wall polysaccharides and modulates the lung
epithelial inflammatory response by suppressing inflammatory mediators and
mucins.

Colonic inflammation, a hallmark of inflammatory bowel disease, can be influenced
by host intrinsic and extrinsic factors. There continues to be a need for models 
of colonic inflammation that can both provide insights into disease pathogenesis 
and be used to investigate potential therapies. Herein, we tested the utility of 
colonoscopic-guided pinch biopsies in mice for studying colonic inflammation and 
its treatment. Gene expression profiling of colonic wound beds after injury
showed marked changes, including increased expression of genes important for the 
inflammatory response. Interestingly, many of these gene expression changes
mimicked those alterations found in inflammatory bowel disease patients.
Biopsy-induced inflammation was associated with increases in neutrophils,
macrophages, and natural killer cells. Injury also led to elevated levels of
sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive lipid that is an important mediator of
inflammation mainly through its receptor, S1P1. Genetic deletion of S1P1 in the
endothelium did not alter the inflammatory response but led to increased colonic 
bleeding. Bacteria invaded into the wound beds, raising the possibility that
microbes contributed to the observed changes in mucosal gene expression. In
support of this, reducing bacterial abundance markedly attenuated the
inflammatory response to wounding. Taken together, this study demonstrates the
utility of the pinch biopsy model of colonic injury to elucidate the molecular
underpinnings of colonic inflammation and its treatment.

Intestinal mesenchymal cells play essential roles in epithelial homeostasis,
matrix remodeling, immunity, and inflammation. But the extent of heterogeneity
within the colonic mesenchyme in these processes remains unknown. Using unbiased 
single-cell profiling of over 16,500 colonic mesenchymal cells, we reveal four
subsets of fibroblasts expressing divergent transcriptional regulators and
functional pathways, in addition to pericytes and myofibroblasts. We identified a
niche population located in proximity to epithelial crypts expressing SOX6, F3
(CD142), and WNT genes essential for colonic epithelial stem cell function. In
colitis, we observed dysregulation of this niche and emergence of an activated
mesenchymal population. This subset expressed TNF superfamily member 14
(TNFSF14), fibroblastic reticular cell-associated genes, IL-33, and Lysyl
oxidases. Further, it induced factors that impaired epithelial proliferation and 
maturation and contributed to oxidative stress and disease severity in vivo. Our 
work defines how the colonic mesenchyme remodels to fuel inflammation and barrier
dysfunction in IBD.

Patients afflicted with ulcerative colitis (UC) are at increased risk of
colorectal cancer. While its causes are not fully understood, UC is associated
with defects in colonic epithelial barriers that sustain inflammation of the
colon mucosa caused by recruitment of lymphocytes and neutrophils into the lamina
propria. Based on genetic evidence that attenuation of the bridging integrator 1 
(Bin1) gene can limit UC pathogenicity in animals, we have explored Bin1
targeting as a therapeutic option. Early feasibility studies in the dextran
sodium sulfate mouse model of experimental colitis showed that administration of 
a cell-penetrating Bin1 monoclonal antibody (Bin1 mAb 99D) could prevent lesion
formation in the colon mucosa in part by preventing rupture of lymphoid
follicles. In vivo administration of Bin1 mAb altered tight junction protein
expression and cecal barrier function. Strikingly, electrophysiology studies in
organ cultures showed that Bin1 mAb could elevate resistance and lower 14
C-mannitol leakage across the cecal mucosa, consistent with a direct
strengthening of colonic barrier function. Transcriptomic analyses of colitis
tissues highlighted altered expression of genes involved in circadian rhythm,
lipid metabolism, and inflammation, with a correction of the alterations by Bin1 
mAb treatment to patterns characteristic of normal tissues. Overall, our results 
suggest that Bin1 mAb protects against UC by directly improving colonic
epithelial barrier function to limit gene expression and cytokine programs
associated with colonic inflammation.

Background: We evaluated the impact of variations in ATG16L1 and NOD2 and genes
on serologic responses in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
Methods: We recruited 308 IBD patients: 130 with Crohn's disease (CD), 67 with
ulcerative colitis (UC), 111 with UC and an ileal pouch (UC-pouch), and 74
healthy controls. NOD2 variants (1007fs, G908R, R702W) and the ATG16L1 A300T
variant were analyzed. The antiglycan antibodies anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae
(ASCA), antilaminaribioside (ALCA), antichitobioside (ACCA), and antimannobioside
carbohydrate (AMCA) were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
Results: Antichitobioside was positive in 28% of patients with CD carrying the
ATG16L1 A300T variant (either heterozygote or homozygote) compared with only 3%
in those without the variant (P < 0.001). Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae was
positive in 86% of patients with CD carrying the NOD2 1007fs variant compared
with 36% in those without the variant (P < 0.001). UC-pouch patients with the
NOD2 1007fs variant had elevated ASCA and ALCA levels compared with those without
the variant (50% vs 7%, P = 0.004, and 50% vs 8%, P = 0.006, respectively).
Importantly, ATG16L1 A300T and NOD2 variants were not associated with serologic
responses in healthy controls and unoperated UC patients. Multivariate analysis
demonstrated that these genetic variants are the main factors associated with
specific antiglycan antibody levels in CD and pouch patients.
Conclusions: Genetic variants may have disease-specific phenotypic (serotypic)
effects. This implies that genetic risk factors may also be disease modifiers.

Dietary nutrients have emerged as potential therapeutic adjuncts for inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD) given their impact on intestinal homeostasis through the
modulation of immune response, gut microbiota composition and epithelial barrier 
stability. Several nutrients have already been associated with a protective
phenotype. Yet, there is a lack of knowledge toward the most promising ones as
well as the most adequate phase of action. To unveil the most prominent therapy
candidates we characterized the colon metabolic profile during colitis
development. We have observed a twofold decrease in threonine levels in mice
subjected to DSS-induced colitis. We then assessed the effect of threonine
supplementation in the beginning of the inflammatory process (DSS + Thr) or when 
inflammation is already established (DSS + Thr D8). Colitis progression was
similar between the treated groups and control colitic mice, yet threonine had a 
surprisingly detrimental effect when administered in the beginning of the
disease, with mice displaying a delayed recovery when compared to control mice
and mice supplemented with threonine after day 8. Although no major changes were 
found in their metabolic profile, DSS + Thr mice displayed altered expression in 
mucin-encoding genes, as well as in goblet cell counts, unveiling an impaired
ability to produce mucus. Moreover, IL-22 secretion was decreased in DSS + Thr
mice when compared to DSS + Thr D8 mice. Overall, these results suggest that
supplementation with threonine during colitis induction impact goblet cell number
and delays the recovery period. This reinforces the importance of a deeper
understanding regarding threonine supplementation in IBD.

Altered response to the intestinal microbiota strongly associates with
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however, how commensal microbial cues are
integrated by the host during the pathogenesis of IBD is not understood.
Epigenetics represents a potential mechanism that could enable intestinal
microbes to modulate transcriptional output during the development of IBD. Here, 
we reveal a histone methylation signature of intestinal epithelial cells isolated
from the terminal ilea of newly diagnosed pediatric IBD patients. Genes
characterized by significant alterations in histone H3-lysine 4 trimethylation
(H3K4me3) showed differential enrichment in pathways involving immunoregulation, 
cell survival and signaling, and metabolism. Interestingly, a large subset of
these genes was epigenetically regulated by microbiota in mice and several
microbiota-sensitive epigenetic targets demonstrated altered expression in IBD
patients. Remarkably though, a substantial proportion of these genes exhibited
H3K4me3 levels that correlated with the severity of intestinal inflammation in
IBD, despite lacking significant differential expression. Collectively, these
data uncover a previously unrecognized epigenetic profile of IBD that can be
primed by commensal microbes and indicate sensitive targets in the epithelium
that may underlie how microbiota predispose to subsequent intestinal inflammation
and disease.

Entamoeba histolytica is the etiologic agent of amebic dysentery, though clinical
manifestation of infection is highly variable ranging from subclinical
colonization to invasive disease. We hypothesize that host genetics contribute to
the variable outcomes of E. histolytica infection; thus, we conducted a
genome-wide association study (GWAS) in two independent birth cohorts of
Bangladeshi infants monitored for susceptibility to E. histolytica disease in the
first year of life. Children with at least one diarrheal episode positive for E. 
histolytica (cases) were compared to children with no detectable E. histolytica
infection in the same time frame (controls). Meta-analyses under a fixed-effect
inverse variance weighting model identified multiple variants in a region of
chromosome 10 containing loci associated with symptomatic E. histolytica
infection. An intergenic insertion between CREM and CCNY (rs58000832) achieved
genome-wide significance (P value from meta-analysis [Pmeta] = 6.05 × 10-9), and 
each additional risk allele of rs58000832 conferred 2.42 increased odds of a
diarrhea-associated E. histolytica infection. The most strongly associated single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within a gene was in an intron of CREM (rs58468612;
Pmeta = 8.94 × 10-8), which has been implicated as a susceptibility locus for
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Gene expression resources suggest associated
loci are related to the lower expression of CREM Increased CREM expression is
also observed in early E. histolytica infection. Further, CREM-/- mice were more 
susceptible to E. histolytica amebic colitis. These genetic associations
reinforce the pathological similarities observed in gut inflammation between E.
histolytica infection and IBD.IMPORTANCE Diarrhea is the second leading cause of 
death for children globally, causing 760,000 deaths each year in children less
than 5 years old. Amebic dysentery contributes significantly to this burden,
especially in developing countries. The identification of host factors that
control or enable enteric pathogens has the potential to transform our
understanding of disease predisposition, outcomes, and treatments. Our discovery 
of the transcriptional regulator cAMP-responsive element modulator (CREM) as a
genetic modifier of susceptibility to amebic disease has implications for
understanding the pathogenesis of other diarrheal infections. Further, emerging
evidence for CREM in IBD susceptibility suggests that CREM is a critical
regulator of enteric inflammation and may have broad therapeutic potential as a
drug target across intestinal inflammatory diseases.

Probiotics are considered to be a potential treatment for ulcerative colitis
(UC). The aim of this study was to compare the preventive effect of a space
flight-induced mutant L. reuteri F-9-35 and its wild type on UC in vivo. Female
mice were randomly assigned to five groups: one normal and four colitic. Mice
from colitis groups were daily gavaged with 0.2 mL 12% (w/v) skim milk containing
the mutant or wild type (1 × 1011 CFU/mL), skim milk alone or distilled water for
the whole experiment period, starting 7 days before colitis induction. UC was
induced by administrating mice with 3.5% (w/v) dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in
drinking water for 7 days, after which DSS was removed and maintained for 3 days 
as a recovery phase. The results showed that the mice fed with L. reuteri F-9-35 
had less inflammatory phenotype according to macroscopic and histological
analysis, reduced myeloperoxidase activity, and lower expression of
proinflammatory genes (Tumor necrosis factor-α, cyclooxygenase-2 and
interleukin-6) in colonic tissue compared with control. Furthermore, L. reuteri
F-9-35 protected the mice from gut microbiota dysbiosis from DDS induced colitis.
Neither wild type nor the milk alone had such beneficial effects. From above we
conclude that L. reuteri F-9-35 has great potential in the prevention of UC as a 
dietary supplement.PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is the most
common inflammatory bowel diseases and there is still a lack of safe and
effective treatments. Consumption of L. reuteri F-9-35 may effective in
preventing human UC.

Background: Interleukin-10 (IL10)/interleukin-10 receptor (IL10R) deficiency is a
rare disease with life-threatening infantile-onset colitis. We sought to
accurately phenotype this disorder based on a large cohort of patients with a
proven defect of IL10 signaling and to clarify the effects of allogeneic
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
Methods: We analyzed the phenotypes of our 61 patients and reviewed 78 other
previously reported cases with identified mutations in the genes encoding IL10 or
IL10R. We also compared the clinical features of patients with interleukin-10
receptor B (IL10RB), interleukin-10 receptor A (IL10RA), and IL10 mutations. The 
therapeutic effects of allogeneic HSCT were evaluated.
Results: We found that the disease onset time was extremely early: 70.3% within
30 days postnatal and 94.9% within the first 6 months of life. In addition, 94.2%
of patients typically presented with perianal lesions. Oral ulcers and skin rash 
were common extra-intestinal manifestations (33.8% and 51.8%, respectively).
There was no statistically significant difference in disease onset time, perianal
lesion involvement, or mortality rate among patients with IL10RB, IL10RA, or IL10
deficiency. However, the surgery rate was higher in patients with IL10RB
mutations than in those with IL10 or IL10RA mutations (P < 0.05). Compared with
those with IL10RA deficiency, a higher percentage (32%, 9 of 28) of patients with
IL10RB mutations developed B-cell lymphoma (P < 0.01). Compared with other
regions, a higher percentage (98.7%) of IL10RA mutations was detected among
patients in East Asia countries (P < 0.01), with hot-spot mutation sites of
c.C301T and c.G537A. Allogeneic HSCT is efficacious but has a high mortality rate
(17.5%, 7 of 40).
Conclusions: Our study expands the current knowledge on the genotype-correlated
phenotypes with a defect of IL10 signaling. B-cell lymphoma was more frequent
than would be expected in patients with IL10RB mutations. There may be a unique
genetic architecture among Eastern Asia compared with other populations. Although
allogeneic HSCT represents a causal therapeutic approach for IL10-and
IL10R-deficient patients, a word of caution is warranted.

Compared with the general population, patients with inflammatory bowel disease
[IBD] have an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer. Molecular
mechanisms underlying colorectal carcinogenesis in the setting of IBD are not
well understood. However, modern molecular investigative tools have facilitated
the identification of features that help distinguish IBD-related carcinoma from
sporadic carcinoma. Moreover, with advances in endoscopic technology and improved
understanding of the natural history, the management of colorectal neoplastic
lesions in IBD patients has evolved. This review discusses the
clinicopathological and molecular features of colorectal neoplastic lesions
complicating IBD. Chronic inflammation is believed to promote the development of 
neoplasia, partly by producing reactive oxygen and nitrogen species [ROS and
NOS], which may interact with genes involved in carcinogenetic pathways.
Furthermore, alterations in microbiota and in the innate and adaptive immune
responses might contribute to this process, particularly by initiating,
regulating, and sustaining chronic inflammation. Earlier detection and better
characterization of neoplastic colorectal lesions complicating IBD and a better
knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying carcinogenesis in this setting
should facilitate improvements in the risk stratification of patients with
longstanding IBD and in the management of dysplastic and malignant colorectal
lesions that arise in this setting.

The proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin-6 (IL-6), plays a critical role in many
chronic inflammatory diseases, particularly inflammatory bowel disease. To
investigate the regulation of IL-6 gene expression at the molecular level,
genomic DNA sequencing of Jinghai yellow chickens (Gallus gallus) was performed
to detect single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the region -2200 base pairs
(bp) upstream to 500 bp downstream of IL-6. Transcription factor binding sites
and CpG islands in the IL-6 promoter region were predicted using bioinformatics
software. Twenty-eight SNP sites were identified in IL-6. Four of these 28 SNPs, 
three [-357 (G > A), -447 (C > G), and -663 (A > G)] in the 5' regulatory region 
and one in the 3' non-coding region [3177 (C > T)] are not labelled in GenBank.
Bioinformatics analysis revealed 11 SNPs within the promoter region that altered 
putative transcription factor binding sites. Furthermore, the C-939G mutation in 
the promoter region may change the number of CpG islands, and SNPs in the 5'
regulatory region may influence IL-6 gene expression by altering transcription
factor binding or CpG methylation status. Genetic diversity analysis revealed
that the newly discovered A-663G site significantly deviated from Hardy-Weinberg 
equilibrium. These results provide a basis for further exploration of the
promoter function of the IL-6 gene and the relationships of these SNPs to
intestinal inflammation resistance in chickens.

Chronic inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) results from a breakdown
of intestinal immune homeostasis and compromise of the intestinal barrier.
Genome-wide association studies have identified over 200 genetic loci associated 
with risk for IBD, but the functional mechanisms of most of these genetic
variants remain unknown. Polymorphisms at the TNFSF15 locus, which encodes the
TNF superfamily cytokine commonly known as TL1A, are associated with
susceptibility to IBD in multiple ethnic groups. In a wide variety of murine
models of inflammation including models of IBD, TNFSF15 promotes immunopathology 
by signaling through its receptor DR3. Such evidence has led to the hypothesis
that expression of this lymphocyte costimulatory cytokine increases risk for IBD.
In contrast, here we show that the IBD-risk haplotype at TNFSF15 is associated
with decreased expression of the gene by peripheral blood monocytes in both
healthy volunteers and IBD patients. This association persists under various
stimulation conditions at both the RNA and protein levels and is maintained after
macrophage differentiation. Utilizing a "recall-by-genotype" bioresource for
allele-specific expression measurements in a functional fine-mapping assay, we
localize the polymorphism controlling TNFSF15 expression to the regulatory region
upstream of the gene. Through a T cell costimulation assay, we demonstrate that
genetically regulated TNFSF15 has functional relevance. These findings indicate
that genetically enhanced expression of TNFSF15 in specific cell types may confer
protection against the development of IBD.

OBJECTIVES: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic and multifactorial
diseases resulting from a complex interaction of host genetic factors and
environmental stimuli. Although many genome-wide association studies have
identified host genetic factors associated with IBD, rare Mendelian forms of IBD 
have been reported in patients with very early onset forms. Therefore, this study
aimed to identify genetic variants associated with infantile-onset IBD.
PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: We obtained genomic DNA from whole blood samples of a
male patient with infantile-onset IBD and nonconsanguineous Korean parents.
Whole-exome sequencing was performed using trio samples. Then, we analyzed the
data using susceptibility genes for monogenic forms of IBD and various
immunodeficiencies and protein structural analysis.
RESULTS: The patient who presented with oral aphthous ulcers at the age of 14
days suffered from severe colitis and was refractory to medical treatment.
Compound heterozygous mutations in IL10RA (p.R101W; p.T179T) were found in the
patient. In addition, a hemizygous mutation in complement factor properdin (CFP) 
(p.L456V) located on the X-chromosome was detected, inherited from the patient's 
mother. Protein structural modeling suggested impaired properdin subunit
interactions by p.L456V that may hamper protein oligomerization required for
complement activation.
CONCLUSION: This study identified compound heterozygous mutations in IL10RA
combined with a hemizygous CFP mutation in infantile-onset IBD by using
whole-exome sequencing. CFP p.L456V may exacerbate symptoms of infantile-onset
IBD by disturbing oligomerization of properdin.

Surveys suggest that Cannabis provides benefit for people with inflammatory bowel
disease. However, mechanisms underlying beneficial effects are not clear. We
performed in situ hybridization RNAscope® combined with immunohistochemistry to
show cell-specific distribution and regulation of cannabinoid receptor 1 and 2
(CB1, CB2), G protein-coupled receptor 55 (GPR55), and monoacylglycerol lipase
(MGL) mRNA in immune cells using murine models of intestinal and systemic
inflammation. In healthy animals, the presence in enteric ganglia is high for CB1
mRNA, but low for CB2 and GPR55 mRNAs. MGL mRNA is predominant throughout the
intestinal wall including myenteric neurons, epithelium, circular and
longitudinal muscular layers, and the lamina propria. Within the immune system,
B220+ cells exhibit high gene expression for CB2 while the expression of CB2 in
F4/80+ and CD3+ cells is less prominent. In contrast, GPR55 mRNA is highly
present in F4/80+ and CD3+ cells. qRT-PCR of total colonic segments shows that
the expression of GPR55 and MGL genes drops during intestinal inflammation. Also 
at cellular levels, GPR55 and MGL gene expression is reduced in F4/80+, but not
CD3+ cells. As to systemic inflammation, reduced gene expression of MGL is
observed in ileum by qRT-PCR, while at cellular levels, altered gene expression
is also seen for CB1 and GPR55 in CD3+ but not F4/80+ cells. In summary, our
study reveals changes in gene expression of members of the endocannabinoid system
in situ attesting particularly GPR55 and MGL a distinct cellular role in the
regulation of the immune response to intestinal and systemic inflammation.

Th17 cells play a critical role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases,
including multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus,
Sjogren's syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease. Despite the extensive
investigation into this T cell lineage, little is understood regarding the role
of Th17 lineage-specific lncRNAs (long non-coding RNAs) > 200 nt. lncRNAs may
influence disease through a variety of mechanisms; their expression could be
regulated by SNPs. lncRNAs can also affect the expression of neighboring genes or
complementary miRNAs, and their expression may have lineage-specific patterns. In
the system biology study presented here, the effective lncRNAs from different
criteria were predicted for each autoimmune disease, and we then evaluated their 
expression levels in 50 MS patients compared to 25 controls using qRT-PCR. We
identified changes in the expression levels of AL450992.2, AC009948.5, and
RP11-98D18.3 as potential peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) biomarkers for
MS among our studied lncRNAs in which co-expression analysis of AL450992.2 had
the most AUCs, and the relationship to RORC was also assessed. We propose that
the recurrently deregulated lncRNAs identified in this report could provide a
valuable resource for studies aimed at delineating the relationship between
functional lncRNAs and autoimmune disorders.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Mucosal gene expression have not been fully enlightened in
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Aim of this study was to define IL23A, IL17A,
IL17F and TLR9 expression in different IBD phenotypes.
METHODS: Evaluation of mRNA levels was performed in paired non-inflamed and
inflamed mucosal biopsies of newly diagnosed 50 Crohn's disease (CD) and 54
ulcerative colitis (UC) patients by quantitative real-time PCR analysis.
RESULTS: IL17A and IL17F expression levels were significantly increased in
inflamed IBD mucosa. Inflamed CD ileal and UC mucosa showed increased IL23A,
while only inflamed CD ileal samples showed increased TLR9 mRNA level.
Correlation between analysed mRNAs levels and endoscopic and clinical disease
activity were found in UC, but only with clinical activity in CD.
CONCLUSION: Both CD and UC presented expression of Th17-associated genes.
Nevertheless, expression profiles between different disease forms varies which
should be taken into account for future research and therapeutics strategies.

BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) exhibits no defined aetiology.
However, such factors as genetic and nitro-oxidative stress are associated with
chronic inflammation and IBD progression to colorectal cancer (CRC). The present 
review discusses the association of nitro-oxidative stress, inflammation and
advanced glycation end products (AGE) and its corresponding receptor (RAGE) in
IBD and examines the connection between these factors and nuclear factors, such
as nuclear factor kappa B (NF- κB), factor-erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf2),
and p53 mutant (p53M).
METHODS: We searched the PubMed, ScienceDirect and Web of Science databases using
a combination of the following terms: IBD, CRC, oxidative stress, inflammation,
NF-κB, Nrf2, p53M, AGE and RAGE.
RESULTS: Oxidative stress and inflammation activated two cellular pathways, the
nuclear expression of pro-inflammatory, pro-oxidant and pro-oncogenic genes based
on NF-κB and p53M, which is associated with NF-κB activation, deoxyribonucleic
acid (DNA) damage and the expression of pro-oncogenic genes. Nrf2 stimulates the 
nuclear expression of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant systems and
anti-inflammatory genes, and is inhibited by chronic oxidative stress, NF-κB and 
p53M. AGE/RAGE are involved in inflammation progression because RAGE
polymorphisms and increased RAGE levels are found in IBD patients. Alterations of
these pathways in combination with oxidative damage are responsible for IBD
symptoms and the progression to CRC.
CONCLUSIONS: IBD is an inflammatory and nitro-oxidative stress-based bowel
disease. Achieving a molecular understanding.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have received increasing attention for their involvement
in the pathogenesis of cancer; however, the characterization and function of
circRNAs in colitis-induced colon carcinoma remains largely unknown. A
colitis-induced colon carcinoma model was established in mice treated with
azoxymethane-dextran sodium sulfate (AOM-DSS), and the circRNA profile was
screened by next generation sequencing. Bioinformatic tools, including Gene
Ontology (GO) analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway
analysis, and network analysis were used to predict the functions of
differentially expressed circRNAs and potentially coexpressed target genes. Among
the detected candidate 3069 circRNA genes, 126 circRNAs were upregulated, and 108
circRNAs were down regulated in colon tissues from AOM/DSS mice compared to those
from control mice. A total of six of these candidate circRNAs were validated by
RT-PCR. GO analysis revealed that numerous target genes including most microRNAs 
were involved in the Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway, actin cytoskeleton, focal adhesion,
and additional biological processes. Our study revealed a comprehensive
expression and functional profile for differentially expressed circRNAs in
AOM/DSS induced colon carcinogenesis, indicating possible involvement of these
dysregulated circRNAs in the development of colitis-induced colon carcinoma. The 
mmu-circ-001226/mmu-circ-000287-miRNA-mRNA network may provide a potential
mechanism for colitis-associated colorectal cancer.

Constant consumption of broad bean (Vicia faba L.) induces intestinal
inflammation and reduces growth rate in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus C.
et V). However, the mechanisms underlying these effects are unclear. In mammalian
models of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), endotoxin and flagellin cause
intestinal inflammation through upregulation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α
expression. We therefore speculated that broad bean consumption alters intestinal
microbiota composition, thereby increasing the relative abundance of
endotoxin-producing Gram-negative and flagellated bacteria and resulting in
upregulation of TNF-α and intestinal inflammation in grass carp. We tested this
hypothesis by comparing intestinal microbiota compositions of grass carp fed
broad bean (GCBB), hybrid giant napier (Pennisetum sinese Roxb, GCHG), or formula
feed (GCFF) by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We also performed a histological
analysis of the intestinal inner wall by scanning electron microscopy and
measured intestinal wall and serum concentrations of TNF-α. Our results revealed 
epithelial cell damage including microvillus effacement and synechia along with
increased TNF-α levels in the intestinal wall in the GCBB group as compared to
the GCHG and GCFF groups. The relative abundances of Gram-negative and
flagellated bacteria were also higher in the GCBB group than in the GCHG and GCFF
groups; this was accompanied by upregulation of genes expressing endotoxin and
flagellin in intestinal microbiota. Thus, broad bean-induced intestinal
inflammation in grass carp shares features with IBD. Our findings demonstrate
that the microbiome in fish is directly influenced by diet and provide a
reference for deconstructing host-intestinal microbiota interactions.

Propionibacterium freudenreichii is a beneficial Gram-positive bacterium,
traditionally used as a cheese-ripening starter, and currently considered as an
emerging probiotic. As an example, the P. freudenreichii CIRM-BIA 129 strain
recently revealed promising immunomodulatory properties. Its consumption
accordingly exerts healing effects in different animal models of colitis,
suggesting a potent role in the context of inflammatory bowel diseases. This
anti-inflammatory effect depends on surface layer proteins (SLPs). SLPs may be
involved in key functions in probiotics, such as persistence within the gut,
adhesion to host cells and mucus, or immunomodulation. Several SLPs coexist in P.
freudenreichii CIRM-BIA 129 and mediate immunomodulation and adhesion. A mutant
P. freudenreichii CIRM-BIA 129ΔslpB (CB129ΔslpB) strain was shown to exhibit
decreased adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells. In the present study, we
thoroughly analyzed the impact of this mutation on cellular properties. Firstly, 
we investigated alterations of surface properties in CB129ΔslpB. Surface
extractable proteins, surface charges (ζ-potential) and surface hydrophobicity
were affected by the mutation. Whole-cell proteomics, using high definition mass 
spectrometry, identified 1,288 quantifiable proteins in the wild-type strain,
i.e., 53% of the theoretical proteome predicted according to P. freudenreichii
CIRM-BIA 129 genome sequence. In the mutant strain, we detected 1,252 proteins,
including 1,227 proteins in common with the wild-type strain. Comparative
quantitative analysis revealed 97 proteins with significant differences between
wild-type and mutant strains. These proteins are involved in various cellular
process like signaling, metabolism, and DNA repair and replication. Finally, in
silico analysis predicted that slpB gene is not part of an operon, thus not
affecting the downstream genes after gene knockout. This study, in accordance
with the various roles attributed in the literature to SLPs, revealed a
pleiotropic effect of a single slpB mutation, in the probiotic P. freudenreichii.
This suggests that SlpB may be at a central node of cellular processes and
confirms that both nature and amount of SLPs, which are highly variable within
the P. freudenreichii species, determine the probiotic abilities of strains.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Both apoptotic and nonapoptotic cell extrusion preserve the
barrier functions of epithelia. Live cell extrusion is the paradigm for
homeostatic renewal of intestinal epithelial cells (IEC). By extension, as
extruded cells are not apoptotic, this form of cell shedding is thought to be
largely ignored by lamina propria phagocytes and without immune consequence.
RECENT FINDINGS: Visualization of apoptotic IEC inside distinct subsets of
intestinal phagocytes during homeostasis has highlighted apoptosis as a normal
component of the natural turnover of the intestinal epithelium. Analysis of
phagocytes with or without apoptotic IEC corpses has shown how apoptotic IEC
constrain inflammatory pathways within phagocytes and induce immunosuppressive
regulatory CD4 T-cell differentiation. Many of the genes involved overlap with
susceptibility genes for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
SUMMARY: Excessive IEC death and loss-of-barrier function is characteristic of
IBD. As regulatory and tolerogenic mechanisms are broken in IBD, a molecular
understanding of the precise triggers and modes of IEC death as well as their
consequences on intestinal inflammation is necessary. This characterization
should guide new therapies that restore homeostatic apoptosis, along with its
associated programs of immune tolerance and immunosuppression, to achieve mucosal
healing and long-term remission.

The incidence of early-onset paediatric inflammatory bowel disease is increasing 
worldwide. Defined as a diagnosis of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or
inflammatory bowel disease unclassified before the age of 10 years, the disease
is complex, multifactorial, and lifelong, and affects nutrition and psychological
wellbeing. Over 200 genes have been implicated and a further 52 genes are known
to cause monogenic disease, often presenting in infancy. Heritability of
early-onset inflammatory bowel disease is hypothesised to be between that of
infantile-onset (ie, <6 years old) and adult-onset disease, with genetic cause
characterised by a few genes with modest or large effect size. Although
early-onset disease is typically more severe than infantile-onset and adult-onset
disease, long-term morbidity has not been assessed. Disease management is
multifaceted and multidisciplinary, and is focused on the safe induction of
remission and prevention of relapse. Although the advent of monoclonal antibody
therapy has had a positive effect in the management of inflammatory bowel
disease, treatment effects in early-onset inflammatory bowel disease are less
certain. Additional challenges include maintenance of growth, navigation of
puberty, and transition to adult services for long-term management.

Rare variants are thought to contribute to the genetics of inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD), which is more common amongst the Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) population.
A family-based approach using exome sequencing of AJ individuals with IBD was
employed with a view to identify novel rare genetic variants for this disease.
Exome sequencing was performed on 960 Jewish individuals including 513 from 199
multiplex families with up to eight cases. Rare, damaging variants in loci
prioritized by linkage analysis and those shared by multiple affected individuals
within the same family were identified. Independent evidence of association of
each variant with disease was assessed. A number of candidate variants were
identified, including in genes involved in the immune system. The ability to
achieve statistical significance in independent case/control replication data
was limited by power and was only achieved for variants in the well-established
Crohn's disease gene, NOD2. This work demonstrates the challenges of identifying 
disease-associated rare damaging variants from exome data, even amongst a
favorable cohort of familial cases from a genetic isolate. Further research of
the prioritized rare candidate variants is required to confirm their association 
with the disease.

Crohn's disease is a complex genetic trait characterized by chronic relapsing
intestinal inflammation. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified
more than 170 loci associated with the disease, accounting for ∼14% of the
disease variance. We hypothesized that rare genetic variation in GWAS positional 
candidates also contribute to disease pathogenesis. We performed targeted,
massively-parallel sequencing of 101 genes in 205 children with Crohn's disease, 
including 179 parent-child trios and 200 controls, both of European ancestry. We 
used the gene burden test implemented in VAAST and estimated effect sizes using
logistic regression and meta-analyses. We identified three genes with nominally
significant p-values: NOD2, RTKN2, and MGAT3 Only NOD2 was significant after
correcting for multiple comparisons. We identified eight novel rare variants in
NOD2 that are likely disease-associated. Incorporation of rare variation and
compound heterozygosity nominally increased the proportion of variance explained 
from 0.074 to 0.089. We estimated the population attributable risk and total
heritability of variation in NOD2 to be 32.9% and 3.4%, respectively, with 3.7%
and 0.25% accounted for by rare putatively functional variants. Sequencing
probands (as opposed to genotyping) to identify rare variants and incorporating
phase by sequencing parents can recover a portion of the missing heritability of 
Crohn's disease.

Background and Aims: pH-sensing ovarian cancer G-protein coupled receptor-1
[OGR1/GPR68] is regulated by key inflammatory cytokines. Patients suffering from 
inflammatory bowel diseases [IBDs] express increased mucosal levels of OGR1
compared with non-IBD controls. pH-sensing may be relevant for progression of
fibrosis, as extracellular acidification leads to fibroblast activation and
extracellular matrix remodelling. We aimed to determine OGR1 expression in
fibrotic lesions in the intestine of Crohn's disease [CD] patients, and the
effect of Ogr1 deficiency in fibrogenesis.
Methods: Human fibrotic and non-fibrotic terminal ileum was obtained from CD
patients undergoing ileocaecal resection due to stenosis. Gene expression of
fibrosis markers and pH-sensing receptors was analysed. For the initiation of
fibrosis in vivo, spontaneous colitis by Il10-/-, dextran sodium sulfate
[DSS]-induced chronic colitis and the heterotopic intestinal transplantation
model were used.
Results: Increased expression of fibrosis markers was accompanied by an increase 
in OGR1 [2.71 ± 0.69 vs 1.18 ± 0.03, p = 0.016] in fibrosis-affected human
terminal ileum, compared with the non-fibrotic resection margin. Positive
correlation between OGR1 expression and pro-fibrotic cytokines [TGFB1 and CTGF]
and pro-collagens was observed. The heterotopic animal model for intestinal
fibrosis transplanted with terminal ileum from Ogr1-/- mice showed a decrease in 
mRNA expression of fibrosis markers as well as a decrease in collagen layer
thickness and hydroxyproline compared with grafts from wild-type mice.
Conclusions: OGR1 expression was correlated with increased expression levels of
pro-fibrotic genes and collagen deposition. Ogr1 deficiency was associated with a
decrease in fibrosis formation. Targeting OGR1 may be a potential new treatment
option for IBD-associated fibrosis.

Background: Crohn's disease and Ulcerative colitis are known as inflammatory
bowel disease with high morbidity which are as a result of increasing immune
responses to intestinal microbiota in genetically susceptible individuals. The
association of adherent invasive Escherichia coli with Crohn's disease in human
has been discussed for decades. The principal aim of this study was to assess the
relationship between adherent invasive Escherichia coli in Iranian patients with 
Crohn's disease. Methods: The presence of adherent invasive Escherichia coli DNA 
and viable adherent invasive Escherichia coli cells were identified through PCR
and conventional culture methods, respectively. All the specimens were
subsequently cultured in Hi Chrome Agar medium. Results: Using molecular assay,
the invasive plasmid antigen H and invasion-association locus genes were detected
from tissue samples confirming the presence of adherent-invasive Escherichia
coli. The invasive plasmid antigen H was detected in 46.7% of CD and 13.3% of
healthy peoples. The invasion-association locus gene was found in 36.7% of
patients with Crohn's disease and 10% in individuals without IBD. Conclusion:
This study demonstrated an increased frequency of adherent invasive E. coli with 
invasive plasmid antigen H and invasion-association locus genes from patients
with CD in comparison to control individuals. Moreover, it was shown that
adherent invasive E. coli with the invasive plasmid antigen H and
invasion-association locus genes can act as a predisposing factor in the
development of IBD.

Inflammatory bowel disease refers to chronic inflammatory disorders that affect
the gastrointestinal tract. Ubiquitination is an important protein
post-translational modification. In recent years, the research of
ubiquitination-deubiquitination system in the development of inflammatory bowel
disease has become a hot spot. Up to now, the E3 ubiquitin ligases such as ring
finger protein 183 (RNF183), RNF20, Itch and A20 were well studied in
inflammatory bowel disease. RNF183 promotes the activation of the NF-κB pathway
by increasing the ubiquitination and degradation of IκBα; RNF20 drives histone
H2B monoubiquitylation, downregulates a panel of inflammation-associated genes;
Itch inhibits IL-17-mediated colon inflammation by retinoid acid related orphan
receptor γt ubiquitination; A20 has ubiquitinating-deubiquitinating activity to
regulates colon inflammation. This article reviews the role and regulatory
mechanism of RNF183, RNF20, Itch and A20 in the pathogenesis of inflammatory
bowel disease.

Interleukin 33 (IL33) is a cytokine found in the extracellular space (mature
IL33) or in the cell nucleus (full-length IL33). Nuclear accumulation of IL33 has
been reported in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) during intestinal inflammation
and cancer, but a functional role for this nuclear form remains unclear. To study
the role of nuclear IL33 in IEC, we generated transgenic mice expressing
full-length IL33 in the intestinal epithelium (Vfl33 mice). Expression of
full-length IL33 in the epithelium resulted in accumulation of IL33 protein in
the nucleus and secretion of IL33. Over-expression of full-length IL33 by IEC did
not promote gut inflammation, but induced expression of genes in the IEC and
lamina propria lymphocytes (LPL) that correlated negatively with genes expressed 
in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Because the IL33 receptor ST2 is expressed 
by IEC, there was the potential that both the mature and full-length forms could 
mediate this effect. To specifically interrogate the transcriptional role of
nuclear IL33, we intercrossed the Vfl33 mice with ST2- deficient mice. ST2
deficiency completely abrogated the transcriptional effects elicited by IL33
expression, suggesting that the transcriptional effects of IL33 on IEC are
mediated by its mature, not its nuclear form.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms inducing and regulating
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) upon chronic intestinal inflammation
is critical for understanding the exact pathomechanism of inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD). The aim of this study was to determine the expression profile of
TAM family receptors in an inflamed colon. For this, we used a rat model of
experimental colitis and also collected samples from colons of IBD patients.
Samples were taken from both inflamed and uninflamed regions of the same colon;
the total RNA was isolated, and the mRNA and microRNA expressions were monitored.
We have determined that AXL is highly induced in active-inflamed colon, which is 
accompanied with reduced expression of AXL-regulating microRNAs. In addition, the
expression of genes responsible for inducing or maintaining mesenchymal
phenotype, such as SNAI1, ZEB2, VIM, MMP9, and HIF1α, were all significantly
induced in the active-inflamed colon of IBD patients while the epithelial marker 
E-cadherin (CDH1) was downregulated. We also show that, in vitro, monocytic and
colonic epithelial cells increase the expression of AXL in response to LPS or
TNFα stimuli, respectively. In summary, we identified several interacting genes
and microRNAs with mutually exclusive expression pattern in active-inflamed colon
of IBD patients. Our results shed light onto a possible AXL- and
microRNA-mediated regulation influencing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in 
IBD.

Background and Aims: The aim of this study was to investigate the genome-wide DNA
methylation status in treatment-naïve ulcerative colitis [UC], and to explore the
relationship between DNA methylation patterns and gene expression levels in
tissue biopsies from a well-stratified treatment-naïve UC patient group.
Methods: Mucosal biopsies from treatment-naïve patients [n = 10], and a healthy
control group [n = 11] underwent genome-wide DNA bisulfite sequencing. Principal 
component analysis [PCA] and diverse statistical methods were applied to obtain a
dataset of differentially methylated genes. DNA methylation annotation was
investigated using the UCSC Genome Browser. Gene set enrichments were obtained
using the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes [KEGG] and PANTHER.
Results: Of all significantly differentially expressed genes [DEGs], 25%
correlated with DNA methylation patterns; 30% of these genes were methylated at
CpG sites near their transcription start site [TSS]. Hyper-methylation was
observed for genes involved in homeostasis and defence, whereas hypo-methylation 
was observed for genes playing a role in immune response [i.e. chemokines and
interleukins]. Of the differentially DNA methylated genes, 25 were identified as 
inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] susceptibility genes. Four genes [DEFFA6, REG1B,
BTNL3, OLFM4] showed DNA methylation in the absence of known CpG islands.
Conclusions: Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis revealed distinctive functional
patterns for hyper-and hypo-methylation in treatment-naïve UC. These distinct
patterns could be of importance in the development and pathogenesis of UC.
Further investigation of DNA methylation patterns may be useful in the
development of the targeting of epigenetic processes, and may allow new treatment
and target strategies for UC patients.

It is suggested that subtyping of complex inflammatory diseases can be based on
genetic susceptibility and relevant environmental exposure (G+E). We propose that
using matched cellular phenotypes in human subjects and corresponding preclinical
models with the same G+E combinations is useful to this end. As an example,
defective Paneth cells can subtype Crohn's disease (CD) subjects; Paneth cell
defects have been linked to multiple CD susceptibility genes and are associated
with poor outcome. We hypothesized that CD susceptibility genes interact with
cigarette smoking, a major CD environmental risk factor, to trigger Paneth cell
defects. We found that both CD subjects and mice with ATG16L1T300A (T300A; a
prevalent CD susceptibility allele) developed Paneth cell defects triggered by
tobacco smoke. Transcriptional analysis of full-thickness ileum and Paneth
cell-enriched crypt base cells showed the T300A-smoking combination altered
distinct pathways, including proapoptosis, metabolic dysregulation, and selective
downregulation of the PPARγ pathway. Pharmacologic intervention by either
apoptosis inhibitor or PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone prevented smoking-induced
crypt apoptosis and Paneth cell defects in T300A mice and mice with conditional
Paneth cell-specific knockout of Atg16l1. This study demonstrates how explicit
G+E can drive disease-relevant phenotype and provides rational strategies for
identifying actionable targets.

BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) mostly comprised of Crohn's disease 
(CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) is a condition arising from the combined effects
of genetic, environmental, and immunological factors. IBD is associated with
inflammation and altered cytokine profile.
OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed at assessing the association between T helper
type 1 (Th1) cytokine polymorphisms (interferon gamma [IFN-γ] +874 A/T,
interleukin-12 [IL-12] -1188 A/C, IL-2 -330 G/T, IL-2 +166 G/T) and
susceptibility to and clinical features of IBD.
METHODS: The study population was composed of 75 IBD patients (40 CD patients and
35 UC patients) and 140 healthy controls. Genotyping was performed using
polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers.
RESULTS: The A allele of IFN-γ +874 polymorphism was overrepresented in the whole
population of patients with IBD (OR 1.63; 95% CI 1.08-2.47; p = 0.020) and as
well in the subpopulation of patients with CD (OR 2.14; 95% CI 1.26-3.63; p =
0.004), but not in UC. Multiple pairwise comparisons indicated that genotypes of 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the IL-2 and IFN-γ genes are
correlated with IBD, CD, and UC, while neither allele nor genotype frequency of
th1 IL-12 -1188 polymorphism was associated with IBD, CD, or UC. Haplotype
analysis also revealed that the presence of IL-2 -330/+166 TG haplotype versus
the remaining haplotypes (GG, TT, and GT) is a protective factor against IBD (OR 
0.62; p = 0.046).
CONCLUSIONS: The present study reports (for the first time) significant
associations between SNPs within the IFN-γ and IL-2 genes and IBD.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Lymphangiogenesis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of
inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), and vascular endothelial growth factor-C
(VEGF-C) is a powerful lymphangiogenic factor. Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs)
are a promising therapeutic modality for several diseases because ADSCs secret
growth factors and exosomes, which modulate hostile microenvironments affected by
diseases. However, the effect of exosomes on VEGF-C-dependent lymphangiogenesis
and its mechanism remain unclear.
METHODS: ADSCs were cultured in media with or without recombinant VEGF-C and
exosomes were extracted from conditioned medium (CM). Lymphatic endothelial cells
(LECs) were treated with ADSCs-derived exosomes, then proliferation, migration
and tube formation of LECs were assayed using cell counting Kit-8 (CCK-8),
transwell chamber inserts and matrigel-based tube formation assay respectively.
RESULTS: We identified significantly higher levels of miR-132 in exosomes
isolated from VEGF-C-treated ADSCs (ADSCs/VEGF-C) than in those from ADSCs
control. miR-132 was directly transferred from ADSCs to the LECs by the mediation
of exosomes. The exosomes from ADSCs/VEGF-C promoted LECs proliferation,
migration, and tube formation more potently than the exosomes from ADSCs, whereas
pretreatment of ADSCs with miR-132 inhibitor attenuates VEGF-C-dependent
lymphangiogenic response. Finally we reveal that miR-132 promotes lymphangiogenic
response by directly targeting Smad-7 and regulating TGF-β/Smad signaling.
CONCLUSION: These data provide new insights into the role of ADSCs-derived
exosomes as an important player in VEGF-C-dependent lymphangiogenesis.

BACKGROUND: Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor auto-antibodies
(GMAbs) suppress neutrophil-extrinsic GM-CSF signaling and increase risk for
stricturing behavior in Crohn's disease (CD). We aimed to define clinical,
genomic, and functional associations with neutrophil-intrinsic GM-CSF signaling.
METHODS: Missense mutations in CSF2RA, CSF2RB, JAK2, STAT5A, and STAT5B were
identified using whole-exome sequencing in 543 pediatric inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD) patients. Neutrophil-intrinsic GM-CSF signaling was defined using
the GM-CSF-induced STAT5 stimulation index (GMSI) in 180 pediatric IBD patients
and 26 non-IBD controls. Reduced GM-CSF signaling (GMSI-Lo) was defined as the
20th percentile within the control group. Variation in neutrophil phospho-protein
abundance, bacterial killing, and the global pattern of gene expression with the 
GMSI was determined.
RESULTS: We validated 18 potentially damaging missense mutations in CSF2RA and
CSF2RB. CSF2RA A17G carriage increased from 10% in those with intact neutrophil
GMSI to 32% in those with low GMSI (P = 0.02). The frequency of reduced
Staphylococcus aureus killing increased from 17% in those with intact neutrophil 
GMSI to 35% in GMSI-Lo neutrophils (P = 0.043). Crohn's disease neutrophils with 
low GMSI exhibited specific alterations in phospho-protein networks and genes
regulating cytokine production, wound healing, and cell survival and
proliferation. Stricturing behavior increased from 7% in patients with both low
GMAb and intact GMSI to 64% in patients with both elevated GMAb and low GMSI (P <
0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Low/normal neutrophil-intrinsic GM-CSF signaling is associated with 
CSF2RA missense mutations, alterations in gene expression networks, and higher
rates of disease complications in pediatric CD.

Chronic intestinal inflammation predisposes patients with Inflammatory Bowel
Disease (IBD) to Colitis-Associated Cancer (CAC). In the setting of chronic
inflammation, microsatellite instability (MSI) results from early loss of DNA
damage response (DDR) genes, ultimately leading to tumor formation. Despite
continued efforts to improve early detection of high risk, pre-dysplastic regions
in IBD patients, current macroscopic and genetic surveillance modalities remain
limited. Therefore, understanding the regulation of key DDR genes in the
progression from colitis to cancer may improve molecular surveillance of CAC. To 
evaluate DDR gene regulation in the transition from colitis to tumorigenesis, we 
utilized the well-established Azoxymethane/Dextran Sodium Sulfate (AOM/DSS)
pre-clinical murine model of CAC in C57BL/6 mice. In order to assess colonic
tumor burden in the setting of mutagen and intestinal irritation, tumors were
visualized and graded in real time through high-resolution murine colonoscopy.
Upon sacrifice, colons were opened and assessed for macroscopic tumor via high
magnification surgical lenses (HMSL). Tissues were then sectioned and separated
into groups based on the presence or absence of macroscopically visible tumor.
Critical DDR genes were evaluated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Interestingly,
colon tissue with macroscopically visible tumor (MVT) and colon tissue prior to
observable tumor (the non-macroscopically visible tumor-developing group, NMVT)
were identical in reduced mRNA expression of mlh1, anapc1, and ercc4 relative to 
colitic mice without mutagen, or those receiving mutagen alone. Colitis alone was
sufficient to reduce colonic ercc4 expression when compared to NMVT mice.
Therefore, reduced ercc4 expression may mark the early transition to CAC in a
pre-clinical model, with expression reduced prior to the onset of observable
tumor. Moreover, the expression of select DDR genes inversely correlated with
chronicity of inflammatory disease. These data suggest ercc4 expression may
define early stages in the progression to CAC.

The majority of variants identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
reside in the noncoding genome, affecting regulatory elements including
transcriptional enhancers. However, characterizing their effects requires the
integration of GWAS results with context-specific regulatory activity and linkage
disequilibrium annotations to identify causal variants underlying noncoding
association signals and the regulatory elements, tissue contexts, and target
genes they affect. We propose INFERNO, a novel method which integrates hundreds
of functional genomics datasets spanning enhancer activity, transcription factor 
binding sites, and expression quantitative trait loci with GWAS summary
statistics. INFERNO includes novel statistical methods to quantify empirical
enrichments of tissue-specific enhancer overlap and to identify co-regulatory
networks of dysregulated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). We applied INFERNO to two
large GWAS studies. For schizophrenia (36,989 cases, 113,075 controls), INFERNO
identified putatively causal variants affecting brain enhancers for known
schizophrenia-related genes. For inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (12,882 cases, 
21,770 controls), INFERNO found enrichments of immune and digestive enhancers and
lncRNAs involved in regulation of the adaptive immune response. In summary,
INFERNO comprehensively infers the molecular mechanisms of causal noncoding
variants, providing a sensitive hypothesis generation method for post-GWAS
analysis. The software is available as an open source pipeline and a web server.

The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasing worldwide, most
notably in young children. The development of disease is a combination of several
factors, including genetics, environment, the microbiota, and immune system.
Recently, next-generation sequencing has allowed for the identification of novel 
genetic causes for intestinal disease, including pediatric inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD). These IBD genes can generally be grouped into genes causing either
primary immunodeficiency or intestinal epithelial defects (the focus of this
review). Most of these genes have been functionally validated with in vitro
and/or animal models, and have been demonstrated to cause intestinal disease.
Intestinal epithelial IBD genes are of particular interest since they are the
least amenable to current therapies; therefore, further research is warranted to 
develop potential therapies. A number of cellular pathways are impacted with
intestinal epithelial IBD genes, including intestinal epithelial cell adhesion
and generation of reactive oxygen species. Here, we describe the currently known 
IBD risk alleles and monogenic causal intestinal epithelial genes, their putative
roles in preserving intestinal epithelial cell homeostasis, and their
implications for IBD pathophysiology.

Background & Aims: Chronic inflammation is a predisposing condition for
colorectal cancer. Many studies to date have focused on proinflammatory signaling
pathways in the colon. Understanding the mechanisms that suppress inflammation,
particularly in epithelial cells, is critical for developing therapeutic
interventions. Here, we explored the roles of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)
family signaling through SMAD4 in colonic epithelial cells.
Methods: The Smad4 gene was deleted specifically in adult murine intestinal
epithelium. Colitis was induced by 3 rounds of dextran sodium sulfate in drinking
water, after which mice were observed for up to 3 months. Nontransformed mouse
colonocyte cell lines and colonoid cultures and human colorectal cancer cell
lines were analyzed for responses to TGFβ1 and bone morphogenetic protein 2.
Results: Dextran sodium sulfate treatment was sufficient to drive carcinogenesis 
in mice lacking colonic Smad4 expression, with resulting tumors bearing striking 
resemblance to human colitis-associated carcinoma. Loss of SMAD4 protein was
observed in 48% of human colitis-associated carcinoma samples as compared with
19% of sporadic colorectal carcinomas. Loss of Smad4 increased the expression of 
inflammatory mediators within nontransformed mouse colon epithelial cells
in vivo. In vitro analysis of mouse and human colonic epithelial cell lines and
organoids indicated that much of this regulation was cell autonomous.
Furthermore, TGFβ signaling inhibited the epithelial inflammatory response to
proinflammatory cytokines.
Conclusions: TGFβ suppresses the expression of proinflammatory genes in the colon
epithelium, and loss of its downstream mediator, SMAD4, is sufficient to initiate
inflammation-driven colon cancer. Transcript profiling: GSE100082.

Autophagy is a complicated cellular mechanism that maintains cellular and tissue 
homeostasis and integrity via degradation of senescent, defective subcellular
organelles, infectious agents, and misfolded proteins. Accumulating evidence has 
shown that autophagy is involved in numerous immune processes, such as removal of
intracellular bacteria, cytokine production, autoantigen presentation, and
survival of lymphocytes, indicating an apparent and important role in innate and 
adaptive immune responses. Indeed, in genome-wide association studies,
autophagy-related gene polymorphisms have been suggested to be associated with
the pathogenesis of several autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, such as
systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel
disease, and multiple sclerosis. In addition, conditional knockdown of
autophagy-related genes in mice displayed therapeutic effects on several
autoimmune disease models by reducing levels of inflammatory cytokines and
autoreactive immune cells. However, the inhibition of autophagy accelerates the
progress of some inflammatory and autoimmune diseases via promotion of
inflammatory cytokine production. Therefore, this review will summarize the
current knowledge of autophagy in immune regulation and discuss the therapeutic
and pathogenic role of autophagy in autoimmune diseases to broaden our
understanding of the etiopathogenesis of autoimmune diseases and shed light on
autophagy-mediated therapies.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder that is
associated with psychological stress. However, the full landscape of IBS‑related 
epigenetic factors remains unveiled and needs to be elucidated. The
water‑avoidance stress (WAS) method was used to induce a rat IBS model. Each rat 
was monitored, and its defecation and behavior were recorded. Total colon RNA was
isolated and subjected to Affymetrix GeneChip analysis. Reduced Representation
Bisulfate Sequencing (RRBS) was applied to determine the genome‑wide methylation 
pattern in both IBS and control rats. Rats with IBS egested a significantly
increased amount of dry and loose stools compared with the control animals,
without significant changes in body weight. Compared with the control group,
309 genes were upregulated and 224 genes were downregulated in the colon of the
IBS rats. Notch signaling and focal adhesion were increased in the differentially
expressed genes (DEGs). A total of 541 genes had significant lower methylation
level and 626 genes had significantly higher methylation level in their promoter 
regions. Adherens junction and leukocyte transendothelial migration were enriched
in the differentially methylated genes (DMGs). Few genes were identified in
common in both DEGs and DMGs, suggesting that gene expression was not altered by 
promoter methylation. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain
reaction validation revealed that the mRNA levels of SSX2IP, PARD3 and VCL were
significantly downregulated in the IBS group, in accordance with hypermethylation
of their promoters. In summary, the present study used a WAS‑induced IBS rat
model to provide transcriptome and methylome profiling. Most DEGs were associated
with Notch signaling and focal adhesion, and only a few were altered by promoter 
methylation. The present results demonstrated that psychological stress could
influence the integrity of the intestinal mucosa barrier and regulate
inflammatory response.

SP140 locus has been associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) as well as other
autoimmune diseases by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The causal variant
of these associations (rs28445040-T) alters the splicing of the SP140 gene
transcripts reducing the protein expression. We aimed to understand why the
reduction of SP140 expression produced by the risk variant can increase the
susceptibility to MS. To this end, we determined by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)
analysis the differentially expressed genes after SP140 silencing in
lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). We analyzed these genes by gene ontology (GO), 
comparative transcriptome profiles, enrichment of transcription factors (TFs) in 
the promoters of these genes and colocalization with GWAS risk variants. We also 
monitored the activity of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of
activated B cells (NF-κB) in SP140-silenced cells by luciferase reporter system. 
We identified 100 genes that were up-regulated and 22 genes down-regulated in
SP140-silenced LCLs. GO analysis revealed that genes affected by SP140 were
involved in regulation of cytokine production, inflammatory response and
cell-cell adhesion. We observed enrichment of NF-κB TF in the promoter of
up-regulated genes and NF-κB-increased activity in SP140-silenced cell lines. We 
showed enrichment of genes regulated by SP140 in GWAS-detected risk loci for MS
(14.63 folds), Crohn's disease (4.82 folds) and inflammatory bowel disease (4.47 
folds), not observed in other unrelated immune diseases. Our findings showed that
SP140 is an important repressor of genes implicated in inflammation, suggesting
that decreased expression of SP140, promoted by the rs28445040-T risk variant,
may lead to up-regulation of these genes by means of NF-κB inhibition in B cells.

Background: The risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC) is increased in
patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) of the colon. The aim of the study
was to evaluate the effectiveness of selected methylation gene panel for the
early detection of CRC in high-risk IBD patients.
Methods: In a discovery phase, 73 biopsies of 48 IBD patients (associated or not 
to CRC) were analyzed from genome-wide DNA methylation analysis using the
Illumina Human Methylation 450K BeadChip. The panel of 5 genes selected (EYA4,
SLIT2, FLI1, USP44, and SND1) was validated prospectively using
methylation-specific melting curve analysis in biopsies of diseased and adjacent 
healthy tissue of 203 patients: 38 with IBD and associated neoplasia, 81 patients
with IBD (25 of them with high risk), 48 with sporadic CRC, and 36 healthy
controls.
Results: The prevalence of methylation was higher in patients with IBD and
associated neoplasia (both in diseased and adjacent healthy tissue, 71% and 52%, 
respectively) than in healthy controls (2/36, 6%; P = 6.72E-05). Methylation in
IBD patients at high risk of dysplasia or cancer was more frequently detected
than in patients at low risk (92% vs 57%; odds ratio, 8.63; P = 0.001). EYA4 and 
SLIT2 were the markers most frequently methylated. Differences in methylation
levels were more evident in healthy mucosa (82% vs 15% high vs low risk,
respectively; P = 1.25E-05).
Conclusions: Analysis of this panel of methylation markers may help in the early 
identification of colorectal dysplasia or cancer in high-risk IBD patients.

Pathogens have been a strong driving force for natural selection. Therefore,
understanding how human genetic differences impact infection-related cellular
traits can mechanistically link genetic variation to disease susceptibility. Here
we report the Hi-HOST Phenome Project (H2P2): a catalog of cellular genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) comprising 79 infection-related phenotypes in response
to 8 pathogens in 528 lymphoblastoid cell lines. Seventeen loci surpass
genome-wide significance for infection-associated phenotypes ranging from
pathogen replication to cytokine production. We combined H2P2 with clinical
association data from patients to identify a SNP near CXCL10 as a risk factor for
inflammatory bowel disease. A SNP in the transcriptional repressor ZBTB20
demonstrated pleiotropy, likely through suppression of multiple target genes, and
was associated with viral hepatitis. These data are available on a web portal to 
facilitate interpreting human genome variation through the lens of cell biology
and should serve as a rich resource for the research community.

Historically, Campylobacteriosis has been considered to be zoonotic; the
Campylobacter species that cause human acute intestinal disease such as
Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli originate from animals. Over the past
decade, studies on human hosted Campylobacter species strongly suggest that
Campylobacter concisus plays a role in the development of inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD). C. concisus primarily colonizes the human oral cavity and some
strains can be translocated to the intestinal tract. Genome analysis of C.
concisus strains isolated from saliva samples has identified a bacterial marker
that is associated with active Crohn's disease (one major form of IBD). In
addition to C. concisus, humans are also colonized by a number of other
Campylobacter species, most of which are in the oral cavity. Here we review the
most recent advancements on C. concisus and other human hosted Campylobacter
species including their clinical relevance, transmission, virulence factors,
disease associated genes, interactions with the human immune system and
pathogenic mechanisms.

Background: Transcriptional profiling has been performed on biopsies from
ulcerative colitis patients. Limitations in prior studies include the variability
introduced by inflammation, anatomic site of biopsy, extent of disease, and
medications. We sought to more globally understand the variability of gene
expression from patients with ulcerative colitis to advance our understanding of 
its pathogenesis and to guide clinical study design.
Methods: We performed transcriptional profiling on 13 subjects, including
pediatric and adult patients from 2 hospital sites. For each patient, we
collected 6 biopsies from macroscopically inflamed tissue and 4 biopsies from
macroscopically healthy-appearing tissue. Isolated RNA was used for microarray
gene expression analysis utilizing Affymetrix Human Primeview microarrays.
Ingenuity pathway analysis was used to assess over-representation of gene
ontology and biological pathways. RNAseq was also performed, and differential
analysis was assessed to compare affected vs unaffected samples. Finally, we
modeled the minimum number of biopsies required to reliably detect gene
expression across different subject numbers.
Results: Transcriptional profiles co-clustered independently of the hospital
collection site, patient age, sex, and colonic location, which parallels prior
gene expression findings. A small set of genes not previously described was
identified. Our modeling analysis reveals the number of biopsies and patients per
cohort to yield reliable results in clinical studies.
Conclusions: Key findings include concordance, including some expansion, of
previously published gene expression studies and similarity among different age
groups. We also established a reliable statistical model for biopsy collection
for future clinical studies.

Background and Aims: Inflammatory Bowel Diseases [IBDs] are chronic intestinal
inflammatory conditions in part mediated by CD4+ T cells. Anti-inflammatory
Foxp3+ regulatory T cells [Tregs] maintain immune homeostasis and protect against
IBD development via multiple mechanisms, including cytokine secretion and
cell-cell interaction. CCAAT enhancer binding protein-beta [C/EBPβ] is a
stress-responsive transcription factor linked with IBD susceptibility. Whole-body
C/EBPβ deficiency induces CD4+ T cell-predominant hyperproliferation, and we
hypothesize that this may be due to impaired Treg function.
Methods: We used the C/EBPβ-/- mice in the CD45RBHigh adoptive transfer model, to
assess C/EBPβ-/- CD4+ T cells for their colitiogenic potential, and C/EBPβ-/-
CD4+ Foxp3+ Tregs for their ability to inhibit colitis. We assessed Tregs from
the C/EBPβ-/- mice for expression of Treg functional genes and proteins.
Results: Naïve C/EBPβ-/- CD4+ T cells are more colitogenic in vivo. The
exacerbated colitis does not appear to reflect impaired Treg development,
however, as C/EBPβ-/- mice displayed more, rather than fewer intestinal
CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs in vivo. Instead, this reflects impaired Treg function as seen
by the reduced capacity to suppress T cell proliferation in vitro, along with
decreased secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. These findings were 
corroborated in vivo by additional adoptive co-transfer studies in which wildtype
Tregs prevented colitis but C/EBPβ-/- Tregs did not.
Conclusion: C/EBPβ deficiency impairs Treg function and potentiates T
cell-mediated colitis. A clearer understanding of the function of this
transcription factor may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for IBD.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease and its involvement
area in colon is influenced by a complex network of gene interactions. We
analyzed the weighted gene co-expression networks in microarray dataset from
colonic mucosa of patients with UC and identified one gene co-expression module
that was highly associated with the progression of involved area in UC colon
(Pearson coefficient=0.81, P<0.0001). In total, 523 hub genes in this module were
found to be involved in immune system process after enrichment analysis in Gene
Ontology. By the STRING and Cytoscape analysis, we observed that interleukin-8
(IL-8) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) were centered in the network of hub
genes. We then detected the expression of IL-8 and MMP-9 in mucosa from
left-sided colon of patients using quantitative PCR and immunofluorescence assay 
respectively. Both quantitative PCR and immunofluorescence assay revealed the
expression levels of IL-8 and MMP-9 were significantly different among the
healthy controls, left-sided colitis group and pancolitis group (P<0.05). IL-8
and MMP-9 were detected with an enhanced expression in pancolitis as compared
with leftsided colitis and healthy controls, respectively (P<0.05). This study
demonstrates that immune system process is indispensable in the progression of
disease in colon, and identifies that IL-8 and MMP-9 play potential critical
roles for the progression.

The present study aimed to evaluate the anti-colitis effect and underlying
mechanisms of cardamonin, a natural flavone isolated from Alpinia katsumadai
Hayata. The results showed that oral cardamonin significantly inhibited dextran
sulfate sodium (DSS)- and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced
colitis in mice, evidenced by improvement of disease activity index scores,
myeloperoxidase activity, length shortening and histopathological changes of
colons. A rectal administration of cardamonin also exhibited marked anti-colitis 
effect, suggesting that oral cardamonin might function in a prototype form.
Cardamonin down-regulated levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1,
ASC, cleaved IL-1β in colons of colitis mice. In vitro, cardamonin inhibited
NLRP3 inflammasome activation in THP-1 and bone marrow-derived macrophages. It
acted as an AhR activator, enhanced dissociation of AhR/HSP90 complexes,
association of AhR/ARNT complexes, AhR nuclear translocation, XRE reporter gene
activity, and AhR/ARNT/XRE DNA binding activity in THP-1 cells. The AhR
antagonist CH223191 obviously abolished NLRP3 inflammasome activation inhibited
by cardamonin. Furthermore, cardamonin elevated levels of Nrf2 and its target
genes NQO1, Trx1, SOD2, HO-1, and the effect on NQO1 was the most obvious. The
relationship of cardamonin-adjusted AhR activation, expressions of Nrf2 and NQO1,
and NLRP3 inflammasome activation was confirmed by using CH223191, siAhR, ML385
and siNQO1, respectively. Finally, CH223191 was shown to abolish amelioration of 
cardamonin on DSS- and TNBS-induced colitis, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome
activation and up-regulation of Nrf2 and NQO1 levels in colons. Taken together,
cardamonin ameliorated colitis in mice through the activation of AhR/Nrf2/NQO1
pathway and consequent inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

Objective: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can regulate various genes after binding to target 
mRNAs. Studies on Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) in relation with miRNA are
much less shown. The aim of the present study was to assess the expression
patterns of microRNA 106a and microRNA 362-3p in peripheral blood samples of
Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) patients including Crohn's Disease(CD) and
Ulcerative Colitis (UC).
Methods: This study consisted of 32 CD, 32 UC patients and 32 controls. The
expression level of the micro-RNAs -106a and -362-3p was determined using reverse
transcription and real-time RT-PCR.
Results: Our findings showed that MiR-106a and miR-362-3p are expressed at
significantly higher levels in the peripheral blood from patients with CD and UC 
compared to controls. MiR-106a and miR-362-3p expression are also different in
the peripheral blood of patients regarding the activity score of the disease.
There were significant differences of miR362-3p in active UC relative to inactive
UC.
Conclusion: Altogether our findings suggest that miR-106a and miR-363-3p can play
an important role in the pathogenesis of IBD. The differences in expression of
miR106a and miR362-3p in peripheral blood of the UC and CD patients in an active 
phase in comparison to inactive disease suggest that these miRNAs may be useful
as potential biomarkers for diagnosis and monitoring the disease activity.

BACKGROUND: The Mediterranean diet is considered one of the healthier food habits
and olive oil is one of its key components. Olive oil polyphenols are known to
induce beneficial effects in several pathological conditions, such as
inflammatory bowel disease, and to contrast the proliferation of cancer cells or 
hypercholesterolemia. Polyphenols are also present in waste products derived from
the olive industry: olive mill wastewaters (OMWW) are rich in polyphenols and
there is an increasing interest in using OMWW in animal nutrition. OMWW are
attributed with positive effects in promoting chicken performance and the quality
of food-derived products. However, a tissue-specific transcriptome target
analysis of chickens fed with OMWW has never been attempted.
RESULTS: We explored the effect of dietary OMWW on the intestinal function in
broilers. A morphological analysis of the jejunum revealed that OMWW reduced
crypt depth, whereas no significant modifications were observed for villus height
and the villus height/crypt depth ratio. An RNA Sequencing analysis was performed
on isolated, intestinal, epithelial cells and 280 differentially expressed genes 
were found using a count-based approach. An enrichment analysis revealed that the
majority of up regulated genes in the OMWW group were over-represented by the
regulation of viral genome replication-related GO-Terms, whereas down regulated
genes were mainly involved in cholesterol and lipid metabolism.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed how an industrial waste product can be recycled as 
a feed additive with a positive relapse. OMWW dietary supplementation can be a
nutritional strategy to improve chicken performance and health, prevent
intestinal damage, enhance innate immunity and regulate cholesterol metabolism
and fat deposition.

The widespread use of capsule endoscopy and balloon-assisted endoscopy has
provided easy access for detailed mucosal assessment of the small intestine.
However, the diagnosis of rare small bowel diseases, such as cryptogenic
multifocal ulcerous stenosing enteritis (CMUSE), remains difficult because
clinical and morphological features of these diseases are obscure even for
gastroenterologists. In an issue of this journal in 2017, Hwang et al reviewed
and summarized clinical and radiographic features of 20 patients with an
established diagnosis of CMUSE. Recently, recessive mutations in the PLA2G4A and 
SLCO2A1 genes have been shown to cause small intestinal diseases. The small bowel
ulcers in each disease mimic those in the other and furthermore those found in
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced enteropathy. These recent and novel
findings suggest that a clinical diagnosis exclusively based on the
characteristics of small bowel lesions is possibly imprecise. Genetic analyses
seem to be inevitable for the diagnosis of rare small bowel disorders such as
CMUSE.

The local environment is crucial for shaping the identities of tissue-resident
macrophages (Mϕs). When hemorrhage occurs in damaged tissues, hemoglobin induces 
differentiation of anti-inflammatory Mϕs with reparative function. Mucosal
bleeding is one of the pathological features of inflammatory bowel diseases.
However, the heme-mediated mechanism modulating activation of intestinal innate
immune cells remains poorly understood. Here, we show that heme regulates gut
homeostasis through induction of Spi-C in intestinal CX3CR1high Mϕs. Intestinal
CX3CR1high Mϕs highly expressed Spi-C in a heme-dependent manner, and myeloid
lineage-specific Spic-deficient (Lyz2-cre; Spicflox/flox ) mice showed severe
intestinal inflammation with an increased number of Th17 cells during dextran
sodium sulfate-induced colitis. Spi-C down-regulated the expression of a subset
of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-inducible genes in intestinal CX3CR1high Mϕs to
prevent colitis. LPS-induced production of IL-6 and IL-1α, but not IL-10 and
TNF-α, by large intestinal Mϕs from Lyz2-cre; Spicflox/flox mice was markedly
enhanced. The interaction of Spi-C with IRF5 was linked to disruption of the
IRF5-NF-κB p65 complex formation, thereby abrogating recruitment of IRF5 and
NF-κB p65 to the Il6 and Il1a promoters. Collectively, these results demonstrate 
that heme-mediated Spi-C is a key molecule for the noninflammatory signature of
intestinal Mϕs by suppressing the induction of a subset of TLR-inducible genes
through binding to IRF5.

Cardiology, dermatology, and rheumatology form a fascinating triad. Many skin and
joint disorders are associated with cardiovascular comorbidities because they
share etiologic elements. Female predominance is often remarkable and likely
related to autoimmune pathology. Although studies have shown that X-encoded genes
may be involved in the differences in immunity between males and females, other
studies have also shown that sex chromosomes are irrelevant and that estrogens
and androgens are responsible for the differences. The elevated immune activity
in females provides a beneficial position in coping with a pathogenic stimulus
but may also enhance their susceptibility to autoimmunity. The complexity of the 
immune system and its role as a defensive force against infection requires an
armamentarium to precisely identify and selectively control inflammatory
processes or cells which promote atherosclerosis. On the other hand, the
inflammation in skin diseases seems to be an active source of diverse
proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines which can predispose to cardiovascular
comorbidities. Also, it has been shown that comorbidity disproportionately
accelerates risk in women.The skin offers a readily available window to
facilitate detection of risk factors or even to assist the diagnostic process
regarding a variety of disorders, including those with cardiovascular
involvement. Current imaging techniques provide exquisite capabilities for
diagnosing and possibly even counteracting atherosclerotic plaque formation,
before serious cardiovascular events occur. Combining imaging approaches (such as
videocapillaroscopy, intravascular ultrasound, and FDG positron emission
tomography) with insights based on immunology will likely accelerate advances in 
this area.We review major dermatologic manifestations and rheumatologic disorders
which are associated with cardiac and vascular abnormalities. In particular we
discuss sex-specific aspects concerning incidence and severity of cardiovascular 
disease associated with systemic sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus 
erythematosus, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and hidradenitis suppurativa.

5-aminosalicylate (5-ASA) is widely prescribed for the treatment of inflammatory 
bowel disease (IBD) and prevention of inflammation-associated colorectal cancer
(CRC). Its clinical effect is widely attributed to modulation of host
inflammatory responses. However, the recent association of intestinal dysbiosis
and selective enrichment in Escherichia coli in patients with IBD and CRC raises 
the possibility that 5-ASA might also affect the enteric microflora. The aim of
this study was to investigate the effect of 5-ASA on the growth and virulence of 
E. coli associated with IBD and CRC, and its impact on host cell inflammatory
responses. Our results show that 5-ASA inhibited E. coli growth in a
dose-dependent manner and downregulated the expression of bacterial virulence
genes associated with IBD (fliC, fimH, ompC, yfgL, nlpL, lpfA, htrA, dsbA, fyuA, 
and chuA) and CRC (pks). 5-ASA inhibited E. coli motility (30-70%), epithelial
adherence and invasion, and IL-8 secretion (p < 0.05). 5-ASA reduced E. coli
survival in J774A.1 macrophages by 20 to 50% (p < 0.01) and TNF-α secretion by
infected macrophages up to 30% (p < 0.05). In addition, 5-ASA reduced DNA damage 
in epithelial cells (Caco-2) induced by pks-positive E. coli. Our results reveal 
a multifaceted and previously unrecognized effect of 5-ASA on the growth and
virulence of IBD- and CRC-associated E. coli, in addition to its inhibitory
effect on host cell inflammatory responses. These results suggest that 5-ASA may 
abrogate the proinflammatory and oncogenic effects of E. coli in patients with
IBD and CRC.

Phagocyte microbiocidal mechanisms and inflammatory cytokine production are
temporally coordinated, although their respective interdependencies remain
incompletely understood. Here, we identify a nitric-oxide-mediated antioxidant
response as a negative feedback regulator of inflammatory cytokine production in 
phagocytes. In this context, Keap1 functions as a cellular redox sensor that
responds to elevated reactive nitrogen intermediates by eliciting an adaptive
transcriptional program controlled by Nrf2 and comprised of antioxidant genes,
including Prdx5. We demonstrate that engaging the antioxidant response is
sufficient to suppress Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced cytokine production in
dendritic cells and that Prdx5 is required for attenuation of inflammatory
cytokine production. Collectively, these findings delineate the reciprocal
regulation of inflammation and cellular redox systems in myeloid cells.

The appendix contains abundant lymphoid tissue and is constantly exposed to gut
flora. When completed at a young age, appendicitis followed by appendectomy (AA) 
prevents or significantly ameliorates Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBDs) in later
life. Inflammatory bowel disease comprises Crohn's disease and ulcerative
colitis. Our murine AA model is the only existing experimental model of AA. In
our unique model, AA performed in the most proximal colon limits colitis
pathology in the most distal colon by curbing T-helper 17 cell activity,
diminishing autophagy, modulating interferon activity-associated molecules, and
suppressing endothelin vaso-activity-mediated immunopathology. In the research
presented in this paper, we have examined the role of chemokines in colitis
pathology with our murine AA model. Chemokines are a family of small cytokines
with four conserved cysteine residues. Chemokines induce chemotaxis in adjacent
cells with corresponding receptors. All 40 known chemokine genes and 24 chemokine
receptor genes were examined for gene expression levels in distal colons three
days post-AA and 28 days post-AA. At 28 days post-AA, the chemokine gene CCL5 was
significantly upregulated. Furthermore, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)
showed upregulation of seven CCL5-associated gene-sets 28 days post-AA in
contrast to just one gene-set downregulated at the same time-point. The chemokine
gene CXCL11 was significantly upregulated three days post-AA and 28 days post-AA.
Evaluation using GSEA showed upregulation of six CXCL11-associated gene sets but 
no downregulation of any gene set. At 28 days post-AA, CCL17 gene expression was 
significantly downregulated. There was no expression of any chemokine receptor
gene three days post-AA, but CCR10 was the only chemokine receptor gene that
displayed differential gene expression (upregulation) 28 days post-AA. No
CCR10-associated gene set was upregulated in GSEA in contrast to one
downregulated gene set. Our analysis resulted in identifying three new
therapeutic targets towards ameliorating colitis: CCL5, CXCL11, and CCL17. While 
CCL5 and CXCL11 are good therapeutic chemokine candidates to be exogenously
administered, CCL17 is a good candidate chemokine to competitively inhibit or
limit colitis pathology.

Background and Aims: We aimed to investigate the underlying mechanism of action
of risankizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the IL-23 p19 subunit,
previously reported to induce clinical and endoscopic remission in a randomised
phase II study in patients with active Crohn's disease.
Methods: Ileum and colon biopsies obtained at screening and Week 12 from a
subgroup of patients [n = 106] in the risankizumab phase II study were analysed
by transcriptome-wide RNA-Seq profiling. Univariate associations were assessed
using linear modelling.
Results: By Week 12, risankizumab significantly decreased [p < 0.005] the
expression of 1880 and 765 genes in the colon [false-discovery rate = 0.02] and
ileum [false-discovery rate = 0.05], respectively. These genes were associated
with the IL-23/IL-17 axis, Th1 pathway, innate immunity, and tissue turnover.
Colonic transcriptomic profiles following risankizumab treatment reflected the
transcriptomic changes observed in patients achieving endoscopic response and
remission at Week 12 and were significantly different from placebo [p < 0.005].
The colonic transcriptomic profile, significantly modulated by risankizumab at
Week 12, was indicative of suppression of pathways associated with epithelial
biology. Furthermore, pathways associated with Crohn's disease modulated by
risankizumab treatment included second messenger-mediated signalling, immune
response, lymphocyte and leucocyte activation, lymphocyte differentiation and
cell-cell adhesion.
Conclusions: Endoscopic remission and response observed with risankizumab in
patients with active Crohn's disease was associated with significant
transcriptomic changes in the colon, compared with placebo. Differentiated
expression of genes associated with the IL-23/IL-17 axis was observed in the
colon and ileum 12 weeks after risankizumab treatment.

Canine Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is considered a multifactorial disease
caused by complex interactions between the intestinal immune system, intestinal
microbiota and environmental factors in genetically susceptible individuals.
Although IBD can affect any breed, German shepherd dogs (GSD) in the UK are at
increased risk of developing the disease. Based on previous evidence, the aim of 
the present study was to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which
may confer genetic susceptibility or resistance to IBD using a genome-wide
association study (GWAS). Genomic DNA was extracted from EDTA blood or saliva
samples of 96 cases and 98 controls. Genotyping of cases and controls was
performed on the Canine Illumina HD SNP array and data generated was analyzed
using PLINK. Several SNPs and regions on chromosomes 7,9,11 and 13 were detected 
to be associated with IBD using different SNP-by-SNP association methods and FST 
windows approach. Searching one Mb up-and down-stream of the most significant
SNPs, as identified by single SNP analysis as well as 200Kb before and after the 
start and the end position of the associated regions identified by FST windows
approach, we identified 63 genes. Using a combination of pathways analysis and a 
list of genes that have been reported to be involved in human IBD, we identified 
16 candidate genes potentially associated with IBD in GSD.

RIPK1 (receptor-interacting serine/threonine kinase 1) is a master regulator of
signaling pathways leading to inflammation and cell death and is of medical
interest as a drug target. We report four patients from three unrelated families 
with complete RIPK1 deficiency caused by rare homozygous mutations. The patients 
suffered from recurrent infections, early-onset inflammatory bowel disease, and
progressive polyarthritis. They had immunodeficiency with lymphopenia and altered
production of various cytokines revealed by whole-blood assays. In vitro,
RIPK1-deficient cells showed impaired mitogen-activated protein kinase activation
and cytokine secretion and were prone to necroptosis. Hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation reversed cytokine production defects and resolved clinical
symptoms in one patient. Thus, RIPK1 plays a critical role in the human immune
system.

Background: Since the description of the normal human gut microbiome in healthy
individuals using broad-range polymerase chain reaction, there has been great
advancement in the techniques used to conduct microbiome research and
applications of this research across health, gastrointestinal diseases, and
nongastrointestinal diseases.
Summary and Key Messages: In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), studies have
reported gut dysbiosis meaning that the microbial composition, diversity, and
richness are altered. Persons with IBD harbor on average 25% fewer microbial
genes than healthy persons. Reduced diversity has been reported in both the fecal
and mucosal microbiome of IBD. Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis are systemic 
diseases with immunological alterations in both intestinal and circulating
compartments. As knowledge about the impact of the gut microbiome on the
intestinal and systemic immune response has grown, researchers have begun
exploring how the gut microbiome may impact on other systemic conditions.
Considering the role of microbes especially on regulatory T cells, it was
plausible that the gut microbiome may have a role in other chronic
immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. In this review, studies of the gut
microbiome in other chronic immune-mediated inflammatory diseases are discussed
including how the information can inform our understanding of the gut microbiome 
in IBD.

Crohn's disease (CD) is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that cannot be fully
cured by medication or surgery. In the present study, the aim was to understand
the underlying mechanisms of CD. Two CD microarray datasets were downloaded from 
The Gene Expression Omnibus database: GSE36807 (13 CD and 7 normal samples) and
GSE59071 (8 CD and 11 normal samples). A series of bioinformatics analyses were
conducted, including weighted gene co‑expression network analysis to identify
stable modules, and analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between CD 
and normal samples. The common DEGs in the GSE36807 and GSE59071 datasets were
screened. Subsequently, overlapping genes in the stable modules and the DEGs were
selected to construct a protein‑protein interaction (PPI) network using Cytoscape
software. Enrichment analysis of genes in the network was performed to explore
their biological functions. A total of 10 stable modules and 927 DEGs were
identified, of which 234 genes were shared in the stable modules and the DEGs.
After removal of 32 uncharacterized genes, 202 genes were selected to build the
PPI network. Low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), toll‑like receptor 2
(TLR2), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), forkhead box protein M1 (FOXM1) and
neuropeptide Y (NPY) were revealed as key nodes with high degree. Pathway
enrichment analysis demonstrated that LPL was enriched in the peroxisome
proliferator‑activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway. In conclusion, LDLR,
TLR2, FOXM1 and NPY, as well as LPL in the PPAR signaling pathway may serve
critical roles in the pathogenesis of CD.

Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)is a non-coding RNA which lacks a complete open
reading frame(ORF) and plays an important role in biological processes such as
cell proliferation,differentiation and apoptosis. At present,the expression of
lncRNA has been found to be abnormal in inflammatory reaction and inflammatory
diseases. It might be involved in the development and progression of inflammatory
diseases by regulating the expression of multiple genes and activation of
signaling pathways. This article overviewed the progress in study on relationship
between lncRNA and inflammatory diseases.

Establishing and maintaining beneficial interactions between the host and
associated gut microbiota are pivotal requirements for host health. Autophagy is 
an important catabolic recycling pathway that degrades long-lived proteins and
some organelles by lysosome to maintain cellular homeostasis. Although impaired
autophagy is thought to be closely correlated with Crohn's disease (CD), the
functional role of autophagy in the maintenance of gut microbiota is poorly
understood. As autophagy-related 5 (Atg5) is a key gene associated with the
extension of the phagophoric membrane in autophagic vesicles, we established a
gut-specific Atg5 knockout mouse model, and we found that the disruption of
autophagic flux in the intenstinal epithelium cells dramatically altered the
composition of the gut microbiota and reduced alpha diversity. Microbial function
prediction indicated that the pathway allocated for infectious diseases was
enriched in Atg5-/- mice. "Candidatus Arthromitus" and the Pasteurellaceae family
were increased in Atg5-/- mice, whereas Akkermansia muciniphila and the
Lachnospiraceae family were reduced. Transcriptome analysis revealed that two key
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-related transcription factors, RORC and TBX21,
of host cells were upregulated in Atg5-/- mice, thus elevating the Muc2-related
immunological response. The findings suggest that intestinal autophagy plays a
vital role in modulating the diversity and composition of gut
microbiota.IMPORTANCE The homeostasis of host-microbiota interactions is of great
importance to host health. Previous studies demonstrated that disruption of
autophagy was linked to inflammatory bowel disease. However, the interaction
mechanism of gut microbiota regulated by autophagy was obscure. In an intestinal 
epithelium-specific autophagy-related 5 (Atg5) knockout mouse model, we observed 
a significant alteration and decreased diversity in the gut microbiota of
Atg5-deficient mice compared with that of wild-type mice. Although the numbers of
some organisms (e.g., Akkermansia muciniphila and members of the Lachnospiraceae 
family) associated with the control of inflammation decreased, those of
proinflammationory bacteria (e.g., "Candidatus Arthromitus") and potential
pathogens (the Pasteurellaceae family) increased in Atg5-/- mice. Differential
gene expression analysis revealed that two key genes, RORC and TBX21, involved in
inflammatory bowel disease were upregulated in Atg5-/- mice. Our study suggests
that Atg5 deficiency results in an imbalance of the host-microbe interaction and 
deterioration of the gut microenvironment.

BACKGROUND: There are different and complicated associations between genes and
diseases. Finding the causal associations between genes and specific diseases is 
still challenging. In this work we present a method to predict novel associations
of genes and pathways with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by integrating
information of differential gene expression, protein-protein interaction and
known disease genes related to IBD.
RESULTS: We downloaded IBD gene expression data from NCBI's Gene Expression
Omnibus, performed statistical analysis to determine differentially expressed
genes, collected known IBD genes from DisGeNet database, which were used to
construct a IBD related PPI network with HIPPIE database. We adapted our
graph-based clustering algorithm DPClusO to cluster the disease PPI network. We
evaluated the statistical significance of the identified clusters in the context 
of determining the richness of IBD genes using Fisher's exact test and predicted 
novel genes related to IBD. We showed 93.8% of our predictions are correct in the
context of other databases and published literatures related to IBD.
CONCLUSIONS: Finding disease-causing genes is necessary for developing drugs with
synergistic effect targeting many genes simultaneously. Here we present an
approach to identify novel disease genes and pathways and discuss our approach in
the context of IBD. The approach can be generalized to find disease-associated
genes for other diseases.

Objective: To explore the relationship between ulcerative colitis (UC)
susceptibility and tumor necrosis factor superfamily member (TNFSF) 15 gene
polymorphisms and haplotypes in Han nationality in Zhejiang province of China.
Methods: A total of 408 UC patients and 574 healthy controls were recruited in
this study. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms of TNFSF15 (rs3810936,
rs4263839, rs4979462) were examined by improved multiple ligase detection
reaction (iMLDR) technique. Analyses of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and haplotype
were performed by Haploview 4.2 software in all study subjects. Results: The
variant allele A and genotype (GA+AA) of rs4263839 were less frequent in UC
patients than in controls (45.34% vs. 50.17%, P=0.035;68.38% vs. 76.66%,
P=0.004). According to the severity and location of disease, UC patients were
divided into different subgroups. After multiple comparison correction(α=0.012
5), the frequencies of variant allele A and genotype (GA+AA) of rs4263839 were
lower in patients with severe UC than in the controls (37.69% vs. 50.17%,
P=0.007; 60.00% vs. 76.66%, P=0.004). Similar findings were also drawn for
patients with extensive colitis in contrast with the controls (42.22% vs. 50.17%,
P=0.009; 63.33% vs. 76.66%, P<0.001). Furthermore, the haplotype analysis
indicated that three SNPs above were in a strong LD. The frequency of haplotype
TAC was lower in UC patients than in the controls(40.83% vs. 46.04%, P=0.023).
Also it was less prevalent in patients with severe UC and patients with extensive
colitis when compared with controls respectively (33.38% vs. 46.04%,
P=0.005;37.22% vs. 46.04%, P=0.003). Conclusions: TNFSF15 (rs4263839) variation
might not only reduce the risk of UC, but also affect the severity and lesion
location of UC. The haplotype TAC formed by rs3810936, rs4263839 and rs4979462
might be related to a lower risk of UC, especially in patients with severe
colitis or patients with extensive colitis.

收集408例UC患者和574名性别、年龄相匹配的健康对照者，采用"改良多重高温连接酶检测反应技术（iMLDR）"检测TNFSF15基因3个单核苷酸多态性(SNP)
位点(rs3810936、rs4263839、rs4979462)，并进行连锁不平衡和单倍型分析。 结果：
UC组中rs4263839的变异等位基因A和基因型(GA+AA)频率均低于对照组(45.34%比50.17%，P=0.035；68.38%比76.66%，P=0.
004)。依据UC严重程度和疾病部位进一步分层分析，经多重比较校正检验水准(α=0.012
5)，结果发现重度结肠炎患者中rs4263839的变异等位基因A和基因型(GA+AA)频率低于对照组(37.69%比50.17%，P=0.007；60.00%比7
6.66%，P=0.004)；广泛性结肠炎患者中rs4263839的变异等位基因A和基因型(GA+AA)频率亦低于对照组(42.22%比50.17%，P=0.00
9；63.33%比76.66%，P<0.001)。Haploview
4.2软件分析发现，rs3810936、rs4263839和rs4979462彼此紧密连锁，所构建的单倍型TAC在UC组中的频率低于对照组(40.83%比46.0
4%，P=0.023)；并且与对照组相比，重度结肠炎患者和广泛性结肠炎患者中，单倍型TAC的频率均显著降低(33.38%比46.04%，P=0.005；37.22
%比46.04%，P=0.003)。 结论：
TNFSF15基因rs4263839位点变异不仅可能降低UC的发病风险，还可能影响UC严重程度和疾病部位。由rs3810936、rs4263839和rs49794
62构建的单倍型TAC可能降低UC，尤其是重度结肠炎和广泛性结肠炎的发病风险。.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) continues to increase in prevalence in
industrialized countries. Major complications of IBD include formation of
fibrotic strictures, fistulas, reduced absorptive function, cancer risk, and the 
need for surgery. In other chronic gastrointestinal disease models, stiffness has
been shown to precede fibrosis; therefore, stiffness may be a reasonable
indicator of progression toward stricture formation in IBD patients. Herein, we
seek to quantify tissue stiffness and characterize fibrosis in patients with IBD 
and to compare mechanical properties of unaffected human tissue to common animal 
species used for IBD studies. Inflamed and unaffected tissue from IBD patients
and unaffected tissue from mice, pigs, and cows were indented using a custom
device to determine the effective stiffness. Histology was performed on matched
tissues, and total RNA was isolated from IBD tissue samples and used for gene
expression analysis of pro-fibrotic genes. We observed an increase in the
effective stiffness (steady-state modulus, SSM) (p < 0.0001) and increased
expression of the collagen type I gene (COL1A1, p = 0.01) in inflamed tissue
compared to unaffected areas in our IBD patient cohort. We also found that
increased staining of collagen fibers in submucosa positively correlated with SSM
(p = 0.093). We determined that unaffected animal bowel stiffness is
significantly greater than similar human tissues, suggesting additional
limitations on animal models for translational investigations regarding
stiffness-related hypotheses. Taken together, our data support development of
tools for evaluation of bowel stiffness in IBD patients for prognostic
applications that may enable more accurate prediction of those who will develop
fibrosis and more precise prescription of aggressive therapies.

Background: Many genome- and epigenome-wide association studies (GWAS and EWAS)
and studies of promoter methylation of candidate genes for inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD) have demonstrated significant associations between genetic and
epigenetic changes and IBD. Independent GWA studies have identified genetic
variants in the BACH2, IL6ST, LAMB1, IKZF1, and MGAT3 loci to be associated with 
both IBD and immunoglobulin G (IgG) glycosylation.
Methods: Using bisulfite pyrosequencing, we analyzed CpG methylation in promoter 
regions of these five genes from peripheral blood of several hundred IBD patients
and healthy controls (HCs) from two independent cohorts, respectively.
Results: We found significant differences in the methylation levels in the MGAT3 
and BACH2 genes between both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis when compared
to HC. The same pattern of methylation changes was identified for both genes in
CD19+ B cells isolated from the whole blood of a subset of the IBD patients. A
correlation analysis was performed between the MGAT3 and BACH2 promoter
methylation and individual IgG glycans, measured in the same individuals of the
two large cohorts. MGAT3 promoter methylation correlated significantly with
galactosylation, sialylation, and bisecting GlcNAc on IgG of the same patients,
suggesting that activity of the GnT-III enzyme, encoded by this gene, might be
altered in IBD. The correlations between the BACH2 promoter methylation and IgG
glycans were less obvious, since BACH2 is not a glycosyltransferase and therefore
may affect IgG glycosylation only indirectly.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that epigenetic deregulation of key
glycosylation genes might lead to an increase in pro-inflammatory properties of
IgG in IBD through a decrease in galactosylation and sialylation and an increase 
of bisecting GlcNAc on digalactosylated glycan structures. Finally, we showed
that CpG methylation in the promoter of the MGAT3 gene is altered in CD3+ T cells
isolated from inflamed mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis from a third
smaller cohort, for which biopsies were available, suggesting a functional role
of this glyco-gene in IBD pathogenesis.

The class III PI3-kinase (PIK3C3) is an enzyme responsible for the generation of 
phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P), a critical component of vesicular
membrane. Here, we report that PIK3C3 deficiency in zebrafish results in
intestinal injury and inflammation. In pik3c3 mutants, gut tube forms but fails
to be maintained. Gene expression analysis reveals that barrier-function-related 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) susceptibility genes (e-cadherin, hnf4a, ttc7a) 
are suppressed, while inflammatory response genes are stimulated in the mutants. 
Histological analysis shows neutrophil infiltration into mutant intestinal
epithelium and the clearance of gut microbiota. Yet, gut microorganisms appear
dispensable as mutants cultured under germ-free condition have similar intestinal
defects. Mechanistically, we show that PIK3C3 deficiency suppresses the formation
of PI3P and disrupts the polarized distribution of cell-junction proteins in
intestinal epithelial cells. These results not only reveal a role of PIK3C3 in
gut homeostasis, but also provide a zebrafish IBD model.

Background: Genome-wide association studies have identified a plethora of risk
genes for both Crohn's disease (CD) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS). A subset of 
genes found to be risk factors for CD have also been found to be risk factors for
AS. The objective of our study was to assess whether CD risk genes were
associated with non-invasive clinical markers of gut inflammation in patients
with AS, indicating a potential subset of patients with clinical as well as
genetic overlap.
Methods: A total of 308 Caucasian patients who fulfilled the modified New York
Criteria for AS, were assessed for bowel symptoms using the Dudley Inflammatory
Bowel Symptom Questionnaire (DISQ). Of these patients, 157 also had faecal
calprotectin measured. All AS patients and 568 healthy controls were genotyped
for 10 CD risk loci using predesigned single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
genotyping assays. Chi-square analysis was used to test for association between
genotype and DISQ score and faecal calprotectin level.
Results: The minor allele of two SNPs, one in chromosome region 1q32 SNP
(rs11584383), and one in the gene coding for IL23R (rs11209026) conferred
protection against AS. Only the association of 1q32 remained significant after
Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. Stratification by DISQ score and
faecal calprotectin did not influence the association of 1q32 with AS.
Conclusion: In patients with AS, the association of the CD 1q32 SNP was
independent of non-invasive markers of bowel inflammation. Other CD related SNPs 
were not found have a significant association with AS.

Purpose: Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, that is, ulcerative colitis
and Crohn's disease (CD), face an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer 
(CRC). Evidence, mainly from ulcerative colitis, suggests that TP53 mutations
represent an initial step in the progression from inflamed colonic epithelium to 
CRC. However, the pathways involved in the evolution of CRC in patients with CD
are poorly characterized.Experimental Design: Here, we analyzed 73 tissue samples
from 28 patients with CD-CRC, including precursor lesions, by targeted
next-generation sequencing of 563 cancer-related genes and array-based
comparative genomic hybridization. The results were compared with 24 sporadic
CRCs with similar histomorphology (i.e., mucinous adenocarcinomas), and to The
Cancer Genome Atlas data (TCGA).Results: CD-CRCs showed somatic copy-number
alterations (SCNAs) similar to sporadic CRCs with one notable exception: the gain
of 5p was significantly more prevalent in CD-CRCs. CD-CRCs had a distinct
mutation signature: TP53 (76% in CD-CRCs vs. 33% in sporadic mucinous CRCs), KRAS
(24% vs. 50%), APC (17% vs. 75%), and SMAD3 (3% vs. 29%). TP53 mutations and
SCNAs were early and frequent events in CD progression, while APC, KRAS, and
SMAD2/4 mutations occurred later. In four patients with CD-CRC, at least one
mutation and/or SCNAs were already present in non-dysplastic colonic mucosa,
indicating occult tumor evolution.Conclusions: Molecular profiling of CD-CRCs and
precursor lesions revealed an inflammation-associated landscape of genome
alterations: 5p gains and TP53 mutations occurred early in tumor development.
Detection of these aberrations in precursor lesions may help predicting disease
progression and distinguishes CD-associated from sporadic colorectal neoplasia.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disease, in which the 
intestinal epithelium loses its barrier function. Given the existence of the
oxygen gradient in the intestinal epithelium and that inflammation further
contributes to the tissue hypoxia, we investigated the role of hypoxia-inducible 
factor (HIF), a transcription factor activated under hypoxic conditions in
myeloid cells, in the progression of IBD. To do this, we utilized
myeloid-specific knockout (KO) mice targeting HIF pathways, created by a Cre-loxP
system with human MRP8 (hMRP8), an intracellular calcium-binding protein, as the 
myeloid promoter. By feeding 5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) to hMRP8 von Hippel 
Lindau (Vhl) KO mice, in which HIF-1α and HIF-2α are constitutively activated in 
myeloid cells, we found that these mice were highly susceptible to DSS-induced
colitis, demonstrating greater body weight loss, increased mortality, faster
onset of rectal bleeding, shortened colon length, and increased CD11b- or
Gr-1-positive myeloid cells in the colon compared with wild-type (WT) mice. These
parameters were restored to, if not better than, the WT levels when we examined
hMRP8 Hif-1a KO mice upon 5% DSS feeding. hMRP8 Hif-2a KO mice, on the other
hand, exhibited a similar degree of DSS-induced colitis to that of WT mice.
Lastly, when DSS was given together with azoxymethane to induce tumorigenesis in 
the colon, we found that hMRP8 Hif-1a KO mice exhibited comparable levels of
colorectal tumors to those of WT mice, indicating that HIF-1α in myeloid cells is
dispensable for tumorigenesis. Collectively, our results suggest that HIF-1α
activation in myeloid cells critically regulates IBD progression.

BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes ulcerative colitis
(UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), is a chronic, idiopathic, repeated inflammatory
disease. Colorectal cancer (CRC) that develops in patients with IBD is known as
colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC), but the underlying carcinogenic
mechanism remains unclear. Genomic analysis of sporadic CRC has been well
described based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. Using NGS, we compared 
all exons of 415 cancer-associated genes in patients in Japan and the USA who had
CRC and found similar genomic alteration patterns among the two populations.
However, genomic analysis of CAC has not been thoroughly investigated.
MAIN BODY: The molecular pathogenesis of CAC shares many features with sporadic
CRC, but there are distinct variations in the time and frequency of some
alterations. Gene alterations in CAC are gradually being elucidated using genomic
sequencing analyses. Some studies have shown that gene alteration patterns differ
between UC and CD. The carcinogenesis of CAC depends on unique environmental,
genetic, and immunological factors.
CONCLUSIONS: In this review, we have discussed the differences in genomic
alterations between sporadic CRC and CAC. NGS in patients with IBD has the
potential to detect early CAC and to suggest therapeutic targets.

BACKGROUND: Genetic risk factors, intestinal microbiota and a dysregulated immune
system contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We
have previously demonstrated that dysfunction of protein tyrosine phosphatase
non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2) and PTPN22 contributes to alterations of intestinal
microbiota and the onset of chronic intestinal inflammation in vivo. Here, we
investigated the influence of PTPN2 and PTPN22 gene variants on intestinal
microbiota composition in IBD patients.
METHODS: Bacterial DNA from mucosa-associated samples of 75 CD and 57 UC patients
were sequenced using 16S rRNA sequencing approach. Microbial analysis, including 
alpha diversity, beta diversity and taxonomical analysis by comparing to PTPN2
(rs1893217) and PTPN22 (rs2476601) genotypes was performed in QIIME, the phyloseq
R package and MaAsLin pipeline.
RESULTS: In PTPN2 variant UC patients, we detected an increase in relative
abundance of unassigned genera from Clostridiales and Lachnospiraceae families
and reduction of Roseburia when compared to PTPN2 wild-type (WT) patients.
Ruminoccocus was increased in PTPN22 variant UC patients. In CD patients with
severe disease course, Faecalibacterium, Bilophila, Coprococcus, unclassified
Erysipelotrichaeceae, unassigned genera from Clostridiales and Ruminococcaceae
families were reduced and Bacteroides were increased in PTPN2 WT carriers, while 
Faecalibacterium, Bilophila, Coprococcus, and Erysipelotrichaeceae were reduced
in PTPN22 WT patients when compared to patients with mild disease. In UC patients
with severe disease, relative abundance of Lachnobacterium was reduced in PTPN2
and PTPN22 WT patients, Dorea was increased in samples from PTPN22 WT carriers
and an unassigned genus from Ruminococcaceae gen. was increased in patients with 
PTPN2 variant genotype.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified that IBD-associated genetic risk variants, disease
severity and the interaction of these factors are related to significant
alterations in intestinal microbiota composition of IBD patients.

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases is uprising in
countries like Iran. Genetic predisposing elements play prominent role in the
pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. In this study we studied the role of autophagy
genes like IRGM (Immunity related GTPase M) and ATG16L1 (Autophagy related 16
like 1) in the pathogenesis of Crohn's Disease in Iranian patients.
METHODS: One hundred thirty-eight patients and 99 normal controls were recruited 
in this study. Polymorphisms in -1644 and -308 upstream of IRGM gene were studied
by PCR-sequencing and 20 kb CNVdel/insertion was studied by specific PCR.
Rs10065171, rs4958847 in IRGM gene and rs2241880 in ATG16L1 were studied by
Taqman genotyping assays.
RESULTS: None of the so-called predisposing alleles of IRGM gene predispose
Iranians to Crohn's disease while the prevalence of some of them like CNV
deletion was higher in normal controls. Surprisingly all the so-called
predisposing alleles in IRGM were linked to each other (especially rs4958847 with
rs10065172 and polymorphisms in -308 region with rs4958847). Patients harboring A
allele in rs4958847 site showed higher ratio of fibrostenotic type of disease
while in patients with C/T genotype in rs4958847, colonic involvement was seen
more frequently. G allele in ATG16L1 was associated with Crohn's disease though
it was not associated with any phenotypic manifestation.
CONCLUSION: In our study the association of ATG16L1 to Crohn's disease in Iranian
patients was confirmed while it was shown that the studied polymorphisms in IRGM 
was not associated with Crohn's disease. Therefore in order to have a better
picture about the genetics of Crohn's disease in Iranian patients, it is
recommended to study other clinically effective polymorphisms in IRGM and ATG16L1
in addition to other genes which are responsible for the process of autophagy.

The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are mainly represented by Crohn's disease 
and Ulcerative colitis that are characterized by chronic and relapsing
inflammatory processes of the gastrointestinal system. Curcuma longa L. is a
plant with several medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory effects, and
curcumin is the most important compound derived from its rhizomes. As curcumin
has remarkable anti-inflammatory actions, the aim of this work is to review the
potential use of this compound in IBD patients. We consulted MEDLINE
(PubMed/PMC), and the literature search was performed with the following
combinations of terms "Inflammatory Bowel Diseases" and "Curcumin," "Crohn's
Disease" and "Curcumin," "Ulcerative colitis" and "Curcumin." The inclusion
criteria were articles that showed original studies with human models and the
exclusion criteria were not full-text articles, articles not in English, poster
presentations, letters, editorials, and articles not available. Curcumin
interacts with receptors, growth and transcription factors, cytokines, enzymes,
and genes leading to inhibitory effects on cyclooxygenase-1, tumor necrosis
factor-α, interferon-γ, inducible nitric oxide synthase, transcriptional nuclear 
factor kappa B, and many other molecules associated with inflammatory processes. 
These molecules are critical factors in the positive regulation of inflammatory
cytokines in inflammatory diseases, suggesting that curcumin may be considered as
a new therapeutic agent for patients with IBD. Curcumin is a natural
anti-inflammatory agent that represents an attractive, safe and inexpensive
alternative for the treatment of IBD. Nevertheless, it is necessary to know the
efficient and safe dose and consider its poor absorption.

The gastrointestinal tract is heavily populated with innate and adaptive immune
cells that have an active role in preservation of mucosal homeostasis and
prevention of inflammation. Inflammatory bowel diseases are thought to result
from dysregulated immune function that is influenced by genetic background,
environmental triggers, and microbiome changes. While most inflammatory bowel
disease patients present in adolescent years or adulthood, in a minority of
cases, the disease develops early in life, and in some of these young patients, a
monogenic disease causing intestinal inflammation can be identified. Many of
these conditions result from mutations in immune-mediated genes and can present
with or without concomitant recurrent infections. In this review, we will discuss
the treatment of patients with selected primary immunodeficiencies and
inflammatory bowel diseases. We will focus on five conditions resulting from
mutations in IL10/IL10 receptor, NADPH oxidase complex, XIAP, LRBA, and CTLA-4.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a complex disorder that is associated with
significant morbidity. While many recent advances have been made with new
diagnostic and therapeutic tools, a deeper understanding of its basic
pathophysiology is needed to continue this trend toward improving treatments. By 
utilizing an unbiased, high-throughput transcriptomic analysis of two
well-established mouse models of colitis, we set out to uncover novel coding and 
noncoding RNAs that are differentially expressed in the setting of colonic
inflammation. RNA-seq analysis was performed using colonic tissue from two mouse 
models of colitis, a dextran sodium sulfate-induced model and a genetic-induced
model in mice lacking IL-10. We identified 81 coding RNAs that were commonly
altered in both experimental models. Of these coding RNAs, 12 of the human
orthologs were differentially expressed in a transcriptomic analysis of IBD
patients. Interestingly, 5 of the 12 of human differentially expressed genes have
not been previously identified as IBD-associated genes, including ubiquitin D.
Our analysis also identified 15 noncoding RNAs that were differentially expressed
in either mouse model. Surprisingly, only three noncoding RNAs were commonly
dysregulated in both of these models. The discovery of these new coding and
noncoding RNAs expands our transcriptional knowledge of mouse models of IBD and
offers additional targets to deepen our understanding of the pathophysiology of
IBD. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Much of the genome is transcribed as non-protein-coding
RNAs; however, their role in inflammatory bowel disease is largely unknown. This 
study represents the first of its kind to analyze the expression of long
noncoding RNAs in two mouse models of inflammatory bowel disease and correlate
them to human clinical samples. Using high-throughput RNA-seq analysis, we
identified new coding and noncoding RNAs that were differentially expressed such 
as ubiquitin D and 5730437C11Rik.

Purpose: Inflammatory bowel disease-associated colorectal cancers (IBD-CRC) are
associated with a higher mortality than sporadic colorectal cancers. The poorly
defined molecular pathogenesis of IBD-CRCs limits development of effective
prevention, detection, and treatment strategies. We aimed to identify biomarkers 
using whole-exome sequencing of IBD-CRCs to guide individualized
management.Experimental Design: Whole-exome sequencing was performed on 34
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded primary IBD-CRCs and 31 matched normal lymph
nodes. Computational methods were used to identify somatic point mutations, small
insertions and deletions, mutational signatures, and somatic copy number
alterations. Mismatch repair status was examined.Results: Hypermutation was
observed in 27% of IBD-CRCs. All hypermutated cancers were from the proximal
colon; all but one of the cancers with hypermutation had defective mismatch
repair or somatic mutations in the proofreading domain of DNA POLE Hypermutated
IBD-CRCs had increased numbers of predicted neo-epitopes, which could be
exploited using immunotherapy. We identified six distinct mutation signatures in 
IBD-CRCs, three of which corresponded to known mechanisms of mutagenesis. Driver 
genes were also identified.Conclusions: IBD-CRCs should be evaluated for
hypermutation and defective mismatch repair to identify patients with a higher
neo-epitope load who may benefit from immunotherapies. Prospective trials are
required to determine whether IHC to detect loss of MLH1 expression in dysplastic
colonic tissue could identify patients at increased risk of developing IBD-CRC.
We identified mutations in genes in IBD-CRCs with hypermutation that might be
targeted therapeutically. These approaches would complement and individualize
surveillance and treatment programs. Clin Cancer Res; 24(20); 5133-42. ©2018

BACKGROUND: The genetic and immunological factors that contribute to differences 
in susceptibility and progression between sub-types of inflammatory and
autoimmune diseases continue to be elucidated. Inflammatory bowel disease and
juvenile idiopathic arthritis are both clinically heterogeneous and known to be
due in part to abnormal regulation of gene activity in diverse immune cell types.
Comparative genomic analysis of these conditions is expected to reveal
differences in underlying genetic mechanisms of disease.
METHODS: We performed RNA-Seq on whole blood samples from 202 patients with
oligoarticular, polyarticular, or systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, or with
Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, as well as healthy controls, to
characterize differences in gene expression. Gene ontology analysis combined with
Blood Transcript Module and Blood Informative Transcript analysis was used to
infer immunological differences. Comparative expression quantitative trait locus 
(eQTL) analysis was used to quantify disease-specific regulation of transcript
abundance.
RESULTS: A pattern of differentially expressed genes and pathways reveals a
gradient of disease spanning from healthy controls to oligoarticular,
polyarticular, and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA); Crohn's disease;
and ulcerative colitis. Transcriptional risk scores also provide good
discrimination of controls, JIA, and IBD. Most eQTL are found to have similar
effects across disease sub-types, but we also identify disease-specific eQTL at
loci associated with disease by GWAS.
CONCLUSION: JIA and IBD are characterized by divergent peripheral blood
transcriptomes, the genetic regulation of which displays limited disease
specificity, implying that disease-specific genetic influences are largely
independent of, or downstream of, eQTL effects.

In recent years, an increasing number of Campylobacter species have been
associated with human gastrointestinal (GI) diseases including gastroenteritis,
inflammatory bowel disease, and colorectal cancer. Campylobacter concisus, an
oral commensal historically linked to gingivitis and periodontitis, has been
increasingly detected in the lower GI tract. In the present study, we generated
robust genome sequence data from C. concisus strains and undertook a
comprehensive pangenome assessment to identify C. concisus virulence properties
and to explain potential adaptations acquired while residing in specific
ecological niche(s) of the GI tract. Genomes of 53 new C. concisus strains were
sequenced, assembled, and annotated including 36 strains from gastroenteritis
patients, 13 strains from Crohn's disease patients and four strains from colitis 
patients (three collagenous colitis and one lymphocytic colitis). When compared
with previous published sequences, strains clustered into two main
groups/genomospecies (GS) with phylogenetic clustering explained neither by
disease phenotype nor sample location. Paired oral/faecal isolates, from the same
patient, indicated that there are few genetic differences between oral and gut
isolates which suggests that gut isolates most likely reflect oral strain
relocation. Type IV and VI secretion systems genes, genes known to be important
for pathogenicity in the Campylobacter genus, were present in the genomes
assemblies, with 82% containing Type VI secretion system genes. Our findings
indicate that C. concisus strains are genetically diverse, and the variability in
bacterial secretion system content may play an important role in their virulence 
potential.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Activation of the human pregnane X receptor (PXR; NR1I2) 
has potential therapeutic uses for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Imperatorin 
(IMP), a naturally occurring coumarin, is the main bioactive ingredient of
Angelica dahurica Radix, which is regularly used to treat the common cold and
intestinal disorders. However, there are no data on the protective effects of IMP
against IBD.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The effects of IMP on PXR-modulated cytochrome P450 3A4
(CYP3A4) expression were assessed using a PXR transactivation assay, a mammalian 
two-hybrid assay, a competitive ligand-binding assay, analysis of CYP3A4 mRNA and
protein expression levels and measurement of CYP3A4 activity using a cell-based
reporter gene assay and in vitro model. The inhibitory effects of IMP on NF-κB
activity were evaluated by a reporter assay and NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation. 
The anti-IBD effects of IMP were investigated in a dextran sulphate sodium
(DSS)-induced colitis mouse model. Colon inflammatory cytokines were assessed by 
elisa.
KEY RESULTS: IMP activated CYP3A4 promoter activity, recruited steroid receptor
coactivator 1 to the ligand-binding domain of PXR and increased the expression
and activity of CYP3A4. PXR knockdown substantially reduced IMP-induced increase 
in CYP3A4 expression. Furthermore, IMP-mediated PXR activation suppressed the
nuclear translocation of NF-κB and down-regulated LPS-induced expression of
pro-inflammatory genes. Nevertheless, PXR knockdown partially reduced the
IMP-mediated inhibition of NF-κB. IMP ameliorated DSS-induced colitis by
PXR/NF-κB signalling.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: IMP acts as a PXR agonist to attenuate DSS-induced 
colitis by suppression of the NF-κB-mediated pro-inflammatory response in a
PXR/NF-κB-dependent manner.

Our study was to explore the potential role of miRNA-200b in modulating
tumorigenesis in the model of ulcerative colitis-related colorectal cancer
(UCRCC) and, further, to decipher the underlying mechanisms associated with this 
effect. In this study, we examined a greater number of polyps or adenomas, a
higher grade of epithelial dysplasia accompanied with a decrease in survival
ratio in azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) model mice compared to
mice treated with over-expressed miRNA-200b. Surprisingly, enforced miRNA-200b
expression significantly suppressed AOM/DSS-induced up-regulation of oncologic
markers including β-catenin and CD133. Independent of this, treatment with
miRNA-200b obviously attenuated inflammatory responses, as indicated by
down-regulating tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), transforming growth factor-β
(TGF-β) and blockade of AKT2-mediated NF-κB/IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway.
Furthermore, a simultaneous shift in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
markers such as E-cadherin and N-cadherin were observed to be increased and
decreased, respectively. Coupled with the associated influence of over-expressed 
miRNA-200b were change in colorectal cell morphology shown by Transmission
electron microscope (TEM) and a decrease in expression of rho-kinase2 (ROCK2)
together with AKT2 phosphorylation (p-AKT2). Moreover, mice which were
transfected with negative control of miRNA-200b possessed results that were in
line with that obtained from AOM/DSS model mice. Additionally, we demonstrated
that the 3'untranslated region (UTR) of AKT2 was a direct target of miRNA-200b
through bioinformatics analysis and dual-luciferase assay. Collectively, these
findings suggest that miRNA-200b's contribution to tumor-suppressing program was 
correlated with EMT and inflammatory responses in a AKT2-dependent manner.

Background and Aims: Human intestinal organoids derived from induced pluripotent 
stem cells have tremendous potential to elucidate the intestinal epithelium's
role in health and disease, but it is difficult to directly assay these complex
structures. This study sought to make this technology more amenable for study by 
obtaining epithelial cells from induced pluripotent stem cell-derived human
intestinal organoids and incorporating them into small microengineered Chips. We 
then investigated if these cells within the Chip were polarized, had the 4 major 
intestinal epithelial subtypes, and were biologically responsive to exogenous
stimuli.
Methods: Epithelial cells were positively selected from human intestinal
organoids and were incorporated into the Chip. The effect of continuous media
flow was examined. Immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization were used to
demonstrate that the epithelial cells were polarized and possessed the major
intestinal epithelial subtypes. To assess if the incorporated cells were
biologically responsive, Western blot analysis and quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction were used to assess the effects of interferon (IFN)-γ, and fluorescein
isothiocyanate-dextran 4 kDa permeation was used to assess the effects of IFN-γ
and tumor necrosis factor-α on barrier function.
Results: The optimal cell seeding density and flow rate were established. The
continuous administration of flow resulted in the formation of polarized
intestinal folds that contained Paneth cells, goblet cells, enterocytes, and
enteroendocrine cells along with transit-amplifying and LGR5+ stem cells.
Administration of IFN-γ for 1 hour resulted in the phosphorylation of STAT1,
whereas exposure for 3 days resulted in a significant upregulation of IFN-γ
related genes. Administration of IFN-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α for 3 days
resulted in an increase in intestinal permeability.
Conclusions: We demonstrate that the Intestine-Chip is polarized, contains all
the intestinal epithelial subtypes, and is biologically responsive to exogenous
stimuli. This represents a more amenable platform to use organoid technology and 
will be highly applicable to personalized medicine and a wide range of
gastrointestinal conditions.

GWAS have identified >200 risk loci for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). The
majority of disease associations are known to be driven by regulatory variants.
To identify the putative causative genes that are perturbed by these variants, we
generate a large transcriptome data set (nine disease-relevant cell types) and
identify 23,650 cis-eQTL. We show that these are determined by ∼9720 regulatory
modules, of which ∼3000 operate in multiple tissues and ∼970 on multiple genes.
We identify regulatory modules that drive the disease association for 63 of the
200 risk loci, and show that these are enriched in multigenic modules. Based on
these analyses, we resequence 45 of the corresponding 100 candidate genes in 6600
Crohn disease (CD) cases and 5500 controls, and show with burden tests that they 
include likely causative genes. Our analyses indicate that ≥10-fold larger sample
sizes will be required to demonstrate the causality of individual genes using
this approach.

A20 (TNFAIP3) and ABIN-1 (TNIP1) are candidate susceptibility genes for
inflammatory bowel disease and other autoimmune or inflammatory diseases, but it 
is unclear how these proteins interact in vivo to prevent disease. Here we show
that intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific deletion of either A20 or ABIN-1
alone leads to negligible IEC loss, whereas simultaneous deletion of both A20 and
ABIN-1 leads to rapid IEC death and mouse lethality. Deletion of both A20 and
ABIN-1 from enteroids causes spontaneous cell death in the absence of microbes or
hematopoietic cells. Studies with enteroids reveal that A20 and ABIN-1
synergistically restrict death by inhibiting TNF-induced caspase 8 activation and
RIPK1 kinase activity. Inhibition of RIPK1 kinase activity alone, or caspase
inhibition combined with RIPK3 deletion, abrogates IEC death by blocking both
apoptosis and necroptosis in A20 and ABIN-1 double-deficient cells. These data
show that the disease susceptibility proteins A20 and ABIN-1 synergistically
prevent intestinal inflammation by restricting IEC death and preserving tissue
integrity.

BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the
large intestine histologically characterized by indistinct sustained inflammatory
responses. Genetical susceptibility and environmental factors' effects play the
roles in disease occurrence and it can be life threatening if remains untreated. 
It seems that intensification of inflammatory responses in this condition is not 
restricted to a specific cell line of T lymphocytes. Our aim was to determine the
number of T helper 9 (Th9) cells in inflamed colonic biopsies of UC patients. We 
also correlated it with interleukin (IL)-9 protein level in addition to certain
genes expressions associated with Th9 phenotype.
METHODS: Expression of CD4 and IL-9 were evaluated by immunohistochemical
staining. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to determine
the colonic expression of IL-9 protein and finally mRNA expressions of interferon
regulatory factor 4 (Irf4), Smad2, and Smad3 were measured by real-time
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as critical transcription factors of Th9
differentiation.
RESULTS: Number of Th9 cells was significantly increased in inflamed samples as
compared with normal tissues. Also quantitative measurement of IL-9 by ELISA and 
mRNA expressions of Irf4, Smad2, and Smad3 showed notable correlative
enhancements in patient's samples.
CONCLUSION: Function and number of Th9 cells are up-regulated in the inflamed
mucosa of UC patients as with the protein secretion of IL-9 and mRNA expressions 
of Irf4, Smad2, and Smad3, so Th9 cells and IL-9 may become remarkable
therapeutic targets for IBD treatment in the future.

Background and Aims: Hippo signalling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that
controls organ size by regulating cell proliferation, survival, apoptosis, and
stem cell self-renewal. In addition, Hippo signalling is profoundly implicated in
intestinal regeneration and cancer. However, its roles in the pathogenesis of
Crohn's disease [CD] remain largely unexplored.
Methods: Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction [qRT-PCR]
was performed to identify the deregulated molecules in Hippo signalling.
Expression of the highly upregulated Yes-associated protein 1 [YAP] was
subsequently examined by qRT-PCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry in
the intestinal tissues of CD patients and the colons of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene
sulphonic acid [TNBS]-induced colitis mice. The microRNAs [miRNAs] predicted to
target YAP were explored by transfection of miR-590-5p mimics or inhibitors and
analyzed by luciferase reporter assay. The roles of the miR-590-5p/YAP axis in CD
and colorectal cancer were studied in experimental colitis mice and colorectal
cancer cell lines.
Results: YAP mRNA was significantly upregulated in intestinal epithelial cells in
CD patients and TNBS-induced colitis mice. MiR-590-5p suppressed YAP expression
by directly targeting the YAP 3'-untranslated region in Caco-2 cells and SW620
cells. Upregulation of miR-590-5p in colon reduced YAP level and its downstream
targets in intestinal epithelial cells [IECs]. Treatment of miR-590-5p or YAP
inhibitor Verteporfin alleviated experimental colitis. Targeting the
miR-590-5p/YAP axis inhibited cell proliferation and invasiveness of colorectal
cancer [CRC] cells in vitro.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that miR-590-5p inhibits intestinal inflammation
in mouse colon and tumourigenesis of colorectal cancer cells by inhibiting YAP.
The miR-590-5p/YAP axis may be an important novel mechanism in the pathogenesis
of CD and colorectal cancer.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to uncover new potential genes associated with the
inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The datasets GSE36807 and GSE9686 were obtained from Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO). Totally, 24 Crohn's disease (CD) samples, 20 ulcerative
colitis (UC) samples and 15 healthy controls in the two datasets were used for
our analysis. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by limma 
package. Then, co-expression network was constructed by weighted gene correlation
network analysis (WGCNA) package, and co-expression network modules were obtained
via clustering method. The top 100 genes with the highest connectivity degrees
were selected to construct a new co-expression network (CEN). Besides, pathway
enrichment analysis for the genes in identified modules was conducted with the
clusterProfiler package in R.
RESULTS: Totally, 302 and 2276 DEGs were respectively identified in CD and UC
samples, and 291 ones were both differentially expressed in the two subtypes.
Five modules were identified from the CEN. In the new CEN consisted of the top
100 genes with the highest connectivity degrees, the up-regulated DEGs all
belonged to module 5, and the down-regulated ones all belonged to module 1.
Furthermore, pathway enrichment analysis showed that some DEGs were related to
primary immunodeficiency (e.g., CD4, CD3D and CD40LG), complement and coagulation
cascades (e.g., C2, C1QB and C7) and nitrogen metabolism (e.g., CA1, CA12 and
CA2).
CONCLUSION: The DEGs correlated with primary immunodeficiency, complement and
coagulation cascades and nitrogen metabolism might be important for the
development of IBD.

Colorectal carcinogenesis is a progressive multistep process involving the
sequential accumulation of genetic alterations in tumor suppressor genes and
oncogenes. Downregulated by oncogenes 1 (Dro1/Ccdc80) has been shown to be a
potent tumor suppressor of colorectal carcinogenesis in the genetic ApcMin/+
mouse model. In ApcMin/+ mice, loss of DRO1 strongly increases colonic tumor
multiplicity and leads to the regular formation of adenocarcinoma in the colon.
To investigate DRO1's role in chemically induced as well as
inflammation-associated colorectal carcinogenesis, the effect of Dro1
inactivation was studied in mice subjected to the carcinogen azoxymethane (AOM)
and upon combined treatment with AOM and the proinflammatory agent dextran sodium
sulfate (DSS), respectively. Loss of DRO1 increases multiplicity of preneoplastic
aberrant crypt foci and colonic tumors upon administration of AOM. Combined
treatment with AOM and DSS leads to increased colonic tumor number and promotes
formation of adenocarcinoma in the colon. Moreover, Dro1 inactivation aggravates 
histological signs of acute and chronic DSS-induced colitis, strongly enlarges
the size of ulcerative lesions in the intestinal lining, and exacerbates clinical
signs and morbidity by DSS. Our results demonstrate DRO1 to be a strong tumor
suppressor in the chemically induced colon carcinogenic mouse model.
Additionally, we demonstrate DRO1 to inhibit colitis-associated colon cancer
formation and uncover a novel putative role for DRO1 in inflammatory bowel
disease.

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic, idiopathic, relapsing disorders
of unclear etiology affecting millions of people worldwide. Aberrant interactions
between the human microbiota and immune system in genetically susceptible
populations underlie IBD pathogenesis. Despite extensive studies examining the
involvement of the gut microbiota in IBD using culture-independent techniques,
information is lacking regarding other human microbiome components relevant to
IBD. Since accumulated knowledge has underscored the role of the oral microbiota 
in various systemic diseases, we hypothesized that dissonant oral microbial
structure, composition, and function, and different community ecotypes are
associated with IBD; and we explored potentially available oral indicators for
predicting diseases. We examined the 16S rRNA V3-V4 region of salivary bacterial 
DNA from 54 ulcerative colitis (UC), 13 Crohn's disease (CD), and 25 healthy
individuals using Illumina sequencing. Distinctive sample clusters were driven by
disease or health based on principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) of both the
Operational Taxonomic Unit profile and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
pathways. Comparisons of taxa abundances revealed enrichment of Streptococcaceae 
(Streptococcus) and Enterobacteriaceae in UC and Veillonellaceae (Veillonella) in
CD, accompanied by depletion of Lachnospiraceae and [Prevotella] in UC and
Neisseriaceae (Neisseria) and Haemophilus in CD, most of which have been
demonstrated to exhibit the same variation tendencies in the gut of IBD patients.
IBD-related oral microorganisms were associated with white blood cells, reduced
basic metabolic processes, and increased biosynthesis and transport of substances
facilitating oxidative stress and virulence. Furthermore, UC and CD communities
showed robust sub-ecotypes that were not demographic or severity-specific,
suggesting their value for future applications in precision medicine.
Additionally, indicator species analysis revealed several genera indicative of UC
and CD, which were confirmed in a longitudinal cohort. Collectively, this study
demonstrates evident salivary dysbiosis and different ecotypes in IBD communities
and provides an option for identifying at-risk populations, not only enhancing
our understanding of the IBD microbiome apart from the gut but also offering a
clinically useful strategy to track IBD as saliva can be sampled conveniently and
non-invasively.

BACKGROUND: Escherichia coli is considered a leading bacterial trigger of
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). E. coli isolates from IBD patients primarily
belong to phylogroup B2. Previous studies have focused on broad comparative
genomic analysis of E. coli B2 isolates, and identified virulence factors that
allow B2 strains to reside within human intestinal mucosa. Metabolic capabilities
of E. coli strains have been shown to be related to their colonization site, but 
remain unexplored in IBD-associated strains.
RESULTS: In this study, we utilized pan-genome analysis and genome-scale models
(GEMs) of metabolism to study metabolic capabilities of IBD-associated E. coli B2
strains. The study yielded three results: i) Pan-genome analysis of 110 E. coli
strains (including 53 isolates from IBD studies) revealed discriminating
metabolic genes between B2 strains and other strains; ii) Both comparative
genomic analysis and GEMs suggested that B2 strains have an advantage in
degrading and utilizing sugars derived from mucus glycan, and iii) GEMs revealed 
distinct metabolic features in B2 strains that potentially allow them to utilize 
energy more efficiently. For example, B2 strains lack the enzymes to degrade
amadori products, but instead rely on neighboring bacteria to convert these
substrates into a more readily usable and potentially less sought after product.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results suggest that the metabolic
capabilities of B2 strains vary significantly from those of other strains,
enabling B2 strains to colonize intestinal mucosa.The results from this study
motivate a broad experimental assessment of the nutritional effects on E. coli B2
pathophysiology in IBD patients.

Fargesin is a bioactive lignan from Flos Magnoliae, an herb widely used in the
treatment of allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, and headache in Asia. We sought to
investigate whether fargesin ameliorates experimental inflammatory bowel disease 
(IBD) in mice. Oral administration of fargesin significantly attenuated the
symptoms of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice by decreasing
the inflammatory infiltration and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, reducing tumor 
necrosis factor (TNF)-α secretion, and inhibiting nitric oxide (NO) production in
colitis mice. The degradation of inhibitory κBα (IκBα), phosphorylation of p65,
and mRNA expression of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) target genes were inhibited by
fargesin treatment in the colon of the colitis mice. In vitro, fargesin blocked
the nuclear translocation of p-p65, downregulated the protein levels of inducible
NO synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and dose-dependently inhibited
the activity of NF-κB-luciferase in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 
macrophages. Taken together, for the first time, the current study demonstrated
the anti-inflammatory effects of fargesin on chemically induced IBD might be
associated with NF-κB signaling suppression. The findings may contribute to the
development of therapies for human IBD by using fargesin or its derivatives.

The antimicrobial glycoprotein neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) 
is strongly expressed in several infectious, inflammatory and malignant
disorders, among these inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Fecal and serum NGAL is 
elevated during active IBD and we have recently shown that fecal NGAL is a novel 
biomarker for IBD with a test performance comparable to the established fecal
biomarker calprotectin. This study examines expression of NGAL in the healthy gut
and in Crohn's disease (CD), with emphasis on the previously unexplored small
intestine. Pinch biopsies were taken from active and inactive CD in jejunum,
ileum and colon and from the same sites in healthy controls. Microarray gene
expression showed that the NGAL gene, LCN2, was the second most upregulated among
1820 differentially expressed genes in terminal ileum comparing active CD and
controls (FC 5.86, p = 0.027). Based on immunohistochemistry and in situ
hybridization findings, this upregulation most likely represented increased
expression in epithelial cells. Double immunofluorescence showed NGAL expression 
in 49% (range 19-70) of Paneth cells (PCs) in control ileum with no change during
inflammation. In healthy jejunum, the NGAL expression in PCs was weak to none but
markedly increased during active CD. We further found NGAL also in metaplastic
PCs in colon. Finally, we show for the first time that NGAL is expressed in
enteroendocrine cells in small intestine as well as in colon.

BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disease,
which involves the gut and comprises of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative
colitis (UC). Immune cells, including natural killer (NK) cells, play an
important role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Killer immunoglobulin-like
receptors (KIRs) are NK cell surface receptors, which ligate to the class I major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) and have inhibitory or activating effects on the
NK cells. The aim of this study was to perform a meta-analysis of the six studies
evaluating the association in the polymorphisms of these KIR genes and the IBD
risk (4 UC and 5 CD studies).
METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in the electronic databases to find
all the studies on the KIR gene polymorphism in IBD patients prior to December
2017. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were  used to find any
association between KIR gene polymorphisms and the IBD risk.
RESULTS: Following extraction of the data from the studies, which were screened
by inclusion and exclusion criteria, collectively 432 patients and 886 controls
for UC and 1677 patients and 1308 controls for CD were included in the
meta-analysis. The statistical evaluation demonstrated positive associations
between 2DL5 (OR=1.31, 95% CI=1.01-1.69) and 2DS1 (OR=1.33, 95% CI=1.01-1.76)
members of KIR genes and UC risk, as well a negative association between 2DS3
gene and CD risk was detected (OR=0.74, 95% CI=0.60-0.90).
CONCLUSIONS: There are positive associations between 2DL5 and 2DS1 members of KIR
genes and UC risk and a negative association between 2DS3 and CD risk.

Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disorder characterized by
deregulated inflammation triggered by environmental factors. Notably,
adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC), a bacterium with the ability to
survive within macrophages is believed to be one of such factors. Glucocorticoids
are the first line treatment for CD and to date, it is unknown how they affect
bactericidal and inflammatory properties of macrophages against AIEC. The aim of 
this study was to evaluate the impact of glucocorticoid treatment on AIEC
infected macrophages. First, THP-1 cell-derived macrophages were infected with a 
CD2-a AIEC strain, in the presence or absence of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone
(Dex) and mRNA microarray analysis was performed. Differentially expressed mRNAs 
were confirmed by TaqMan-qPCR. In addition, an amikacin protection assay was used
to evaluate the phagocytic and bactericidal activity of Dex-treated macrophages
infected with E. coli strains (CD2-a, HM605, NRG857c, and HB101). Finally,
cytokine secretion and the inflammatory phenotype of macrophages were evaluated
by ELISA and flow cytometry, respectively. The microarray analysis showed that
CD2-a, Dex, and CD2-a + Dex-treated macrophages have differential inflammatory
gene profiles. Also, canonical pathway analysis revealed decreased phagocytosis
signaling by Dex and anti-inflammatory polarization on CD2-a + Dex macrophages.
Moreover, amikacin protection assay showed reduced phagocytosis upon Dex
treatment and TaqMan-qPCR confirmed Dex inhibition of three
phagocytosis-associated genes. All bacteria strains induced TNF-α, IL-6, IL-23,
CD40, and CD80, which was inhibited by Dex. Thus, our data demonstrate that
glucocorticoids impair phagocytosis and induce anti-inflammatory polarization
after AIEC infection, possibly contributing to the survival of AIEC in infected
CD patients.

Mast cells are well established as divergent modulators of inflammation and
immunosuppression, but their role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains to 
be fully defined. While previous studies have demonstrated a proinflammatory role
for mast cells in acute models of chemical colitis, more recent investigations
have shown that mast cell deficiency can exacerbate inflammation in spontaneous
colitis models, thus suggesting a potential anti-inflammatory role of mast cells 
in IBD. Here, we tested the hypothesis that in chronic, spontaneous colitis, mast
cells are protective. We compared colitis and intestinal barrier function in
IL10-/- mice to mast cell deficient/IL10-/- (double knockout (DKO):
KitWsh/Wsh × IL10-/-) mice. Compared with IL10-/- mice, DKO mice exhibited more
severe colitis as assessed by increased colitis scores, mucosal hypertrophy,
intestinal permeability, and colonic cytokine production. PCR array analyses
demonstrated enhanced expression of numerous cytokine and chemokine genes and
downregulation of anti-inflammatory genes (e.g., Tgfb2, Bmp2, Bmp4, Bmp6, and
Bmp7) in the colonic mucosa of DKO mice. Systemic reconstitution of DKO mice with
bone marrow-derived mast cells resulted in significant amelioration of
IL10-/--mediated colitis and intestinal barrier injury. Together, the results
presented here demonstrate that mast cells exert anti-inflammatory properties in 
an established model of chronic, spontaneous IBD. Given the previously
established proinflammatory role of mast cells in acute chemical colitis models, 
the present findings provide new insight into the divergent roles of mast cells
in modulating inflammation during different stages of colitis. Further
investigation of the mechanism of the anti-inflammatory role of the mast cells
may elucidate novel therapies.

Immunosuppressive drugs are a prerequisite in organ transplantation to prevent
rejection and are also widely used in inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory 
bowel disease (IBD) or also in some hematologic malignancies-depending on the
mode of action. For thiopurine analogs the polymorphic thiopurine
S-methyltransferase (TPMT) was early detected to be associated with
thiopurine-induced leukopenia; recent studies identified also NUDT15 to be
related to this severe side effect. For drugs like methotrexate and mycophenolate
mofetil a number of ADME genes like UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) and ABC
efflux transporters were investigated, however, with partly contradicting
results. For calcineurin inhibitors like cyclosporine and in particular
tacrolimus however, cytochrome P450 3A4 and 3A5 variants were found to
significantly affect the pharmacokinetics. Genetic variants in genes encoding
relevant pharmacodynamic proteins, however, lacked compelling evidence to affect 
the clinical outcome. This chapter reviews the current evidence on the
association of pharmacogenetic traits to dose finding and clinical outcome of
small-molecule immunosuppressants. Moreover this chapter critically summarizes
suitability to apply pharmacogenetics in clinical practice in order to optimize
immunosuppressant therapy.

As part of a broader collaborative network of exome sequencing studies, we
developed a jointly called data set of 5,685 Ashkenazi Jewish exomes. We make
publicly available a resource of site and allele frequencies, which should serve 
as a reference for medical genetics in the Ashkenazim (hosted in part at
https://ibd.broadinstitute.org, also available in gnomAD at
http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org). We estimate that 34% of protein-coding alleles
present in the Ashkenazi Jewish population at frequencies greater than 0.2% are
significantly more frequent (mean 15-fold) than their maximum frequency observed 
in other reference populations. Arising via a well-described founder effect
approximately 30 generations ago, this catalog of enriched alleles can contribute
to differences in genetic risk and overall prevalence of diseases between
populations. As validation we document 148 AJ enriched protein-altering alleles
that overlap with "pathogenic" ClinVar alleles (table available at
https://github.com/macarthur-lab/clinvar/blob/master/output/clinvar.tsv),
including those that account for 10-100 fold differences in prevalence between AJ
and non-AJ populations of some rare diseases, especially recessive conditions,
including Gaucher disease (GBA, p.Asn409Ser, 8-fold enrichment); Canavan disease 
(ASPA, p.Glu285Ala, 12-fold enrichment); and Tay-Sachs disease (HEXA,
c.1421+1G>C, 27-fold enrichment; p.Tyr427IlefsTer5, 12-fold enrichment). We next 
sought to use this catalog, of well-established relevance to Mendelian disease,
to explore Crohn's disease, a common disease with an estimated two to four-fold
excess prevalence in AJ. We specifically attempt to evaluate whether strong
acting rare alleles, particularly protein-truncating or otherwise large
effect-size alleles, enriched by the same founder-effect, contribute excess
genetic risk to Crohn's disease in AJ, and find that ten rare genetic risk
factors in NOD2 and LRRK2 are enriched in AJ (p < 0.005), including several novel
contributing alleles, show evidence of association to CD. Independently, we find 
that genomewide common variant risk defined by GWAS shows a strong difference
between AJ and non-AJ European control population samples (0.97 s.d. higher,
p<10-16). Taken together, the results suggest coordinated selection in AJ
population for higher CD risk alleles in general. The results and approach
illustrate the value of exome sequencing data in case-control studies along with 
reference data sets like ExAC (sites VCF available via FTP at
ftp.broadinstitute.org/pub/ExAC_release/release0.3/) to pinpoint genetic
variation that contributes to variable disease predisposition across populations.

This study aimed to identify genes that may play a role in development of
ulcerative colitis (UC) and gain insight into its pathogenesis.Gene expression
profiling data, including samples collected from 13 early-stage UC (EUC), 8
advanced-stage UC (AUC), and 5 control subjects, were downloaded from the Gene
Expression Omnibus database under the accession number of GSE9452. Differentially
expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in EUC and AUC compared with controls.
DEGs for EUC and AUC, as well as AUC-specific DEGs were subjected to pathway
enrichment analysis. Random Walk with Restart (RWR) was used to identify DEGs
that are critical in UC based on a protein-to-protein interaction (PPI) network
and the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) pathway downloaded from the Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. IL17 and transforming growth
factor beta TGF-β) expression levels in colonic tissue from patients with UC and 
normal colonic mucosa from healthy adults were analyzed by immunohistochemistry
(IHC).A total of 3511 and 911 DEGs were identified in AUC and EUC, respectively. 
The overlapping DEGs and the AUC-specific DEGs were both enriched in pathways
related to immunity, such as antigen processing and presentation. AUC-specific
DEGs were related to cell migration, such as ECM-receptor interaction. Following 
DEG prioritization, TLR4 and STAT1 were linked with EUC, AUC, and CD. The
upregulated gene TGFB increased the number of Th17 cells, as verified by IHC.
Furthermore, PIK3R1, CREBBP, and STAT1 were part of high-degree nodes in the PPI 
sub-network.The upregulated gene TGFB may regulate IL17 expression in UC. PIK3R1 
may participate in immunity and CREBBP may interact with STAT1 in the development
and progression of UC.

Background: Mutations in tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3),
a key player in the negative feedback regulation of nuclear factor-κB signaling, 
have recently been recognized as leading to early onset autoinflammatory and
autoimmune syndrome. Here, we have reported the phenotypes of 3 infantile onset
intractable inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with TNFAIP3 mutations and 
reviewed previously reported cases to establish phenotypic features associated
with TNFAIP3 monogenicity.
Methods: From January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2017, we recruited 58
infantile-onset IBD patients. Targeted sequencing and whole-exome sequencing were
performed. Sanger sequencing confirmed the variants and determined the parental
origin. We followed all the patients with TNFAIP3 mutations in our cohort and
analyzed their clinical data.
Results: Genetic screening in all 58 patients with infantile-onset IBD revealed
44 (75.9%) cases of monogenic disorders, and 3 de novo TNFAIP3 mutations were
identified, including 1 nonsense and 2 frame shift mutations. All the mutations
resulted in premature stop codon. All 3 patients had multiple systemic
involvements, with predominant gastrointestinal diseases.
Conclusions: Most infantile-onset IBD was associated with monogenetic mutation,
and in addition to the 50 reported genes, other rare genetic variants need to be 
determined. TNFAIP3 may be an important candidate gene. The treatment of
TNFAIP3-associated infantile-onset-IBD was challenging.

Goal: The aim of this study was to investigate gene expression levels of proteins
involved in sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) metabolism and signaling in a pediatric
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patient population.
Background: IBD is a debilitating disease affecting 0.4% of the US population.
The incidence of IBD in childhood is rising. Identifying effective targeted
therapies that can be used safely in young patients and developing tools for
selecting specific candidates for targeted therapies are important goals.
Clinical IBD trials now underway target S1PR1, a receptor for the
pro-inflammatory sphingolipid S1P. However, circulating and tissue sphingolipid
levels and S1P-related gene expression have not been characterized in pediatric
IBD.
Methods: Pediatric IBD patients and controls were recruited in a four-site study.
Patients received a clinical score using PUCAI or PCDAI evaluation. Colon
biopsies were collected during endoscopy. Gene expression was measured by
qRT-PCR. Plasma and gut tissue sphingolipids were measured by LC-MS/MS.
Results: Genes of S1P synthesis (SPHK1, SPHK2), degradation (SGPL1), and
signaling (S1PR1, S1PR2, and S1PR4) were significantly upregulated in colon
biopsies of IBD patients with moderate/severe symptoms compared with controls or 
patients in remission. Tissue ceramide, dihydroceramide, and ceramide-1-phosphate
(C1P) levels were significantly elevated in IBD patients compared with controls.
Conclusions: A signature of elevated S1P-related gene expression in colon tissues
of pediatric IBD patients correlates with active disease and normalizes in
remission. Biopsied gut tissue from symptomatic IBD patients contains high levels
of pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory sphingolipids. A combined analysis of gut
tissue sphingolipid profiles with this S1P-related gene signature may be useful
for monitoring response to conventional therapy.

BACKGROUND: Approximately 5% of patients with celiac disease (CeD) do not respond
to a gluten-free diet and progress to refractory celiac disease (RCD), a severe
progression that is characterized by infiltration of intraepithelial T
lymphocytes. Patients with RCD type II (RCDII) show clonal expansions of
intraepithelial T lymphocytes that result in a poor prognosis and a high
mortality rate through development of aggressive enteropathy-associated T-cell
lymphoma. It is not known whether genetic variations play a role in severe
progression of CeD to RCDII.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed the first genome-wide association study to
identify the causal genes for RCDII and the molecular pathways perturbed in
RCDII. The genome-wide association study was performed in 38 Dutch patients with 
RCDII, and the 15 independent top-associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
variants (P<5×10) were replicated in 56 independent French and Dutch patients
with RCDII.
RESULTS: After replication, SNP rs2041570 on chromosome 7 was significantly
associated with progression to RCDII (P=2.37×10, odds ratio=2.36) but not with
CeD susceptibility. SNP rs2041570 risk allele A was associated with lower levels 
of FAM188B expression in blood and small intestinal biopsies. Stratification of
RCDII biopsies based on rs2041570 genotype showed differential expression of
innate immune and antibacterial genes that are expressed in Paneth cells.
CONCLUSION: We have identified a novel SNP associated with the severe progression
of CeD to RCDII. Our data suggest that genetic susceptibility to CeD might be
distinct from the progression to RCDII and suggest a role for Paneth cells in
RCDII progression.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Crohn disease (CD) presents as chronic and often progressive
intestinal inflammation, but the contributing pathogenic mechanisms are unclear. 
We aimed to identify alterations in intestinal cells that could contribute to the
chronic and progressive course of CD.
METHODS: We took an unbiased system-wide approach by performing sequence analysis
of RNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded ileal tissue sections from
patients with CD (n = 36) and without CD (controls; n = 32). We selected
relatively uninflamed samples, based on histology, before gene expression
profiling; validation studies were performed using adjacent serial tissue
sections. A separate set of samples (3 control and 4 CD samples) was analyzed by 
transmission electron microscopy. We developed methods to visualize an
overlapping modular network of genes dysregulated in the CD samples. We validated
our findings using biopsy samples (110 CD samples for gene expression analysis
and 54 for histologic analysis) from the UNITI-2 phase 3 trial of ustekinumab for
patients with CD and healthy individuals (26 samples used in gene expression
analysis).
RESULTS: We identified gene clusters that were altered in nearly all CD samples. 
One cluster encoded genes associated with the enterocyte brush border, leading us
to investigate microvilli. In ileal tissues from patients with CD, the microvilli
were of decreased length and had ultrastructural defects compared with tissues
from controls. Microvilli length correlated with expression of genes that
regulate microvilli structure and function. Network analysis linked the
microvilli cluster to several other down-regulated clusters associated with
altered intracellular trafficking and cellular metabolism. Enrichment of a core
microvilli gene set also was lower in the UNITI-2 trial CD samples compared with 
controls; expression of microvilli genes was correlated with microvilli length
and endoscopy score and was associated with response to treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: In a transcriptome analysis of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded 
ileal tissues from patients with CD and controls, we associated transcriptional
alterations with histologic alterations, such as differences in microvilli
length. Decreased microvilli length and decreased expression of the microvilli
gene set might contribute to epithelial malfunction and the chronic and
progressive disease course in patients with CD.

BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, inflammatory bowel diseases
characterized by uncontrolled inflammatory condition of the colon and rectal
mucosa marked by recurrent periods of remission and exacerbation. Vitamin D
receptor (VDR) is a member of the steroid receptor family that mediates the
effects of vitamin D by regulating transcription of multiple cellular genes. We
aimed to evaluate vitamin d receptor level in biopsy specimen of patients with UC
in this study.
METHODS: VDR levels were retrospectively studied in colon biopsy specimens of UC 
patients. The Spearman's rho correlation analysis, The Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Mann
Whitney U, and chi-square tests were used for statistical analysis. The p values 
below 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: Study included 112 UC patients (65 male and 47 female) and 30 controls
(19 female and 11 male) who had normal results in biopsy examinations carried out
due to various reasons. VDR levels of UC patients were statistically lower than
control subjects, and was not associated with duration of the disease and place
of involvement.
CONCLUSIONS: VDR is an important receptor in the pathogenesis of UC, and
optimizing vitamin D levels could have a therapeutic role in UC.

While proteases are essential in gastrointestinal physiology, accumulating
evidence indicates that dysregulated proteolysis plays a pivotal role in the
pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Nonetheless, the identity of
overactive proteases released by human colonic mucosa remains largely unknown.
Studies of protease abundance have primarily investigated expression profiles,
not taking into account their enzymatic activity. Herein we have used serine
protease-targeted activity-based probes (ABPs) coupled with mass spectral
analysis to identify active forms of proteases secreted by the colonic mucosa of 
healthy controls and IBD patients. Profiling of (Pro-Lys)-ABP bound proteases
revealed that most of hyperactive proteases from IBD secretome are clustered at
28-kDa. We identified seven active proteases: the serine proteases cathepsin G,
plasma kallikrein, plasmin, tryptase, chymotrypsin-like elastase 3 A, and
thrombin and the aminopeptidase B. Only cathepsin G and thrombin were overactive 
in supernatants from IBD patient tissues compared to healthy controls. Gene
expression analysis highlighted the transcription of genes encoding these
proteases into intestinal mucosae. The functional ABP-targeted proteomic approach
that we have used to identify active proteases in human colonic samples bears
directly on the understanding of the role these enzymes may play in the
pathophysiology of IBD.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including
ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, are at increased risk for colorectal
cancer (CRC). Analyses of DNA methylation patterns in stool samples have been
reported to detect CRC in patients with IBD. We sought to validate these findings
in larger cohorts and assess the accuracy of analysis of DNA methylation patterns
in stool for detection of CRC and high-grade dysplasia (HGD) normalized to
methylation level at ZDHHC1.
METHODS: We obtained buffered, frozen stool samples from a US case-control study 
and from 2 European surveillance cohorts (referral or population based) of
patients with chronic ulcerative colitis (n = 248), Crohn's disease (n = 82),
indeterminate colitis (n = 2), or IBD with primary sclerosing cholangitis (n =
38). Stool samples were collected before bowel preparation for colonoscopy or at 
least 1 week after colonoscopy. Among the study samples, stools from individuals 
with IBD but without neoplasia were used as controls (n = 291). DNA was isolated 
from stool, exposed to bisulfite, and then assayed by multiplex quantitative
allele-specific real-time target and signal amplification. We analyzed
methylation levels of BMP3, NDRG4, VAV3, and SFMBT2 relative to the methylation
level of ZDHHC1, and compared these between patients with CRC or HGD and
controls.
RESULTS: Levels of methylation at BMP3 and VAV3, relative to ZDHHC1 methylation, 
identified patients with CRC and HGD with an area under the curve value of 0.91
(95% CI, 0.77-1.00). Methylation levels at specific promotor regions of these
genes identified 11 of the 12 patients with CRC and HGD, with 92% sensitivity
(95% CI, 60%-100%) and 90% specificity (95% CI, 86%-93%). The proportion of
false-positive results did not differ significantly among the case-control,
referral cohort, and population cohort studies (P = .60) when the 90% specificity
cut-off from the whole sample set was applied.
CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of stool samples from 3 independent studies of 332
patients with IBD, we associated levels of methylation at 2 genes (BMP3 and
VAV3), relative to level of methylation at ZDHHC1, with detection of CRC and HGD.
These methylation patterns identified patients with CRC and HGD with more than
90% specificity, and might be used in CRC surveillance.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
disease, is a chronic intestinal inflammatory condition initiated by
integrins-mediated leukocyte adhesion to the activated colonic microvascular
endothelium. Calreticulin (CRT), a calcium-binding chaperone, is known as a
partner in the activation of integrin α subunits (ITGAs). The relationship
between their interaction and the pathogenesis of IBD is largely unknown. Here we
show that a small molecule, orally active ER-464195-01, inhibits the CRT binding 
to ITGAs, which suppresses the adhesiveness of both T cells and neutrophils.
Transcriptome analysis on colon samples from dextran sodium sulfate-induced
colitis mice reveals that the increased expression of pro-inflammatory genes is
downregulated by ER-464195-01. Its prophylactic and therapeutic administration to
IBD mouse models ameliorates the severity of their diseases. We propose that
leukocytes infiltration via the binding of CRT to ITGAs is necessary for the
onset and development of the colitis and the inhibition of this interaction may
be a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of IBD.

Our previous study showed that the Roseburia intestinalis (R. intestinalis), one 
of the dominant intestinal bacterial microbiota, was significantly decreased in
Crohn's disease patients and protected colon epithelial cells from inflammatory
damage. However, the roles of lncRNAs in R. intestinalis flagellin-mediated
anti-inflammation remain unclear. In this study, we investigate global lncRNA
expression profiles using microarray analysis of ulcerative colitis samples from 
DSS/Flagellin-challenged mice and identified a Flagellin-induced upregulated
lncRNA (HIF1A-AS2). Flagellin induced HIF1A-AS2 expression in a dose- and
time-dependent manner via p38-stat1 activation. Selective pharmacological
inhibitors of Stat1 and p38, and genetic knockdown of these genes abolished
Flagellin-induced HIF1A-AS2 expression. In addition, luciferase reporter assay
showed that Flagellin activated HIF1A-AS2 promotor via increasing stat1
phosphorylation. Silencing of HIF1A-AS2 abolished Flagellin-mediated
anti-inflammatory effects, evaluating by upregulation of cytokines expression,
including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-12, but not TNFβ. In addition, knockdown of
HIF1A-AS2 significantly increased p65 and Jnk phosphorylation, and sufficiently
abolished Flagellin-mediated anti-inflammatory affects in vivo. Our study
provides new insights into the mechanisms that lncRNAs regulate
flagellin-mediated alleviation of colonic inflammation. It is indicated that
HIF1A-AS2 may be a modulator of intestinal inflammation and represent a novel
target for future therapeutics.

Regulated antimicrobial peptide expression in the intestinal epithelium is key to
defense against infection and to microbiota homeostasis. Understanding the
mechanisms that regulate such expression is necessary for understanding immune
homeostasis and inflammatory disease and for developing safe and effective
therapies. We used Caenorhabditis elegans in a preclinical approach to discover
mechanisms of antimicrobial gene expression control in the intestinal epithelium.
We found an unexpected role for the cholinergic nervous system. Infection-induced
acetylcholine release from neurons stimulated muscarinic signaling in the
epithelium, driving downstream induction of Wnt expression in the same tissue.
Wnt induction activated the epithelial canonical Wnt pathway, resulting in the
expression of C-type lectin and lysozyme genes that enhanced host defense.
Furthermore, the muscarinic and Wnt pathways are linked by conserved
transcription factors. These results reveal a tight connection between the
nervous system and the intestinal epithelium, with important implications for
host defense, immune homeostasis, and cancer.

Spondyloarthritis (SpA) describes the group of inflammatory diseases
characterized by inflammation within axial joints and/or peripheral arthritis,
enthesitis, and dactylitis. Disease development is strongly determined by genes
and particularly associated with the presence of HLA-B27. Transgenic expression
in animal models leads to induction of a SpA-like disease, suggesting a direct
effect of HLA-B27 on disease development. Genome-wide association studies in SpA 
patients have identified further associations between polymorphisms in genes with
an immune function, in particular in genes controlling the interleukin
(IL)-23/IL-17 signaling pathway. The efficacy of IL-17 inhibitors in SpA patients
underscores the impact of this pathway in this disease. Microscopic gut
inflammation or chronic inflammatory bowel disease is found in the majority of
patients with SpA, suggesting a pathogenic impact of commensal microbiota. In
histopathologic examinations of axial manifestations, replacement of the
subchondral bone marrow by granulation tissue with bone destructive and
reparative properties is found. The mechanisms governing how genetic
predisposition and gut inflammation promote inflammatory reactions at sites of
mechanical stress is a matter of current research.

Gastrointestinal (GI) parasites, hookworms in particular, have evolved to cause
minimal harm to their hosts, allowing them to establish chronic infections. This 
is mediated by creating an immunoregulatory environment. Indeed, hookworms are
such potent suppressors of inflammation that they have been used in clinical
trials to treat inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and celiac disease. Since the
recent description of helminths (worms) secreting extracellular vesicles (EVs),
exosome-like EVs from different helminths have been characterized and their
salient roles in parasite-host interactions have been highlighted. Here, we
analyze EVs from the rodent parasite Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, which has been
used as a model for human hookworm infection. N. brasiliensis EVs (Nb-EVs) are
actively internalized by mouse gut organoids, indicating a role in driving
parasitism. We used proteomics and RNA-Seq to profile the molecular composition
of Nb-EVs. We identified 81 proteins, including proteins frequently present in
exosomes (like tetraspanin, enolase, 14-3-3 protein, and heat shock proteins),
and 27 sperm-coating protein-like extracellular proteins. RNA-Seq analysis
revealed 52 miRNA species, many of which putatively map to mouse genes involved
in regulation of inflammation. To determine whether GI nematode EVs had
immunomodulatory properties, we assessed their potential to suppress GI
inflammation in a mouse model of inducible chemical colitis. EVs from N.
brasiliensis but not those from the whipworm Trichuris muris or control vesicles 
from grapes protected against colitic inflammation in the gut of mice that
received a single intraperitoneal injection of EVs. Key cytokines associated with
colitic pathology (IL-6, IL-1β, IFNγ, and IL-17a) were significantly suppressed
in colon tissues from EV-treated mice. By contrast, high levels of the
anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were detected in Nb-EV-treated mice. Proteins
and miRNAs contained within helminth EVs hold great potential application in
development of drugs to treat helminth infections as well as chronic
non-infectious diseases resulting from a dysregulated immune system, such as IBD.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a condition of chronic inflammatory
intestinal disorder with increasing prevalence but limited effective therapies.
The purine metabolic pathway is involved in various inflammatory processes
including IBD. However, the mechanisms through which purine metabolism modulates 
IBD remain to be established. Here, we found that mucosal expression of genes
involved in the purine metabolic pathway is altered in patients with active
ulcerative colitis (UC), which is associated with elevated gene expression
signatures of the group 3 innate lymphoid cell (ILC3)-interleukin (IL)-22
pathway. In mice, blockade of ectonucleotidases (NTPDases), critical enzymes for 
purine metabolism by hydrolysis of extracellular adenosine 5'-triphosphate (eATP)
into adenosine, exacerbates dextran-sulfate sodium-induced intestinal injury.
This exacerbation of colitis is associated with reduction of colonic
IL-22-producing ILC3s, which afford essential protection against intestinal
inflammation, and is rescued by exogenous IL-22. Mechanistically, activation of
ILC3s for IL-22 production is reciprocally mediated by eATP and adenosine. These 
findings reveal that the NTPDase-mediated balance between eATP and adenosine
regulates ILC3 cell function to provide protection against intestinal injury and 
suggest potential therapeutic strategies for treating IBD by targeting the
purine-ILC3 axis.

We observed the effects of naringin on bone loss in glucocorticoid-treated
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in a rat model. The IBD model was established in
Sprague-Dawley rats by administering 5.0% dextran sodium sulfate. Dexamethasone
(DEX) and naringin were given at the second week. Blood, colon and bone samples
were collected for biomarker assay, histological analysis or microCT analysis.
Superoxide dismutase, catalase and malonaldehyde were measured in bone. A
significant decrease of procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP) level was
observed in DEX-treated IBD groups compared with the control (p < 0.05). P1NP
levels were dose-dependently increased in the presence of naringin intervention. 
Bone loss and decreased bone biomechanical properties were observed in
DEX-treated IBD rats compared with control rats (p < 0.01). Naringin intervention
protected against bone loss and decreased bone biomechanical properties. Bone
formation related gene mRNA expressions were significantly decreased in
DEX-treated IBD rats compared with control rats. Naringin administration reversed
the down-regulation of the expressions of those genes. Naringin treatment reduced
the oxidative stress in bone from DEX-treated IBD rats. Our data indicated that
naringin may have great potential for the treatment of bone loss in
glucocorticoid-treated IBD patients via blocking oxidative stress and promoting
bone formation.

TNF is an important mediator in numerous inflammatory diseases, e.g., in
inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). In IBD, acute increases in TNF production can
lead to disease flares. Glucocorticoids (GCs), which are steroids that bind and
activate the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), are able to protect animals and humans
against acute TNF-induced inflammatory symptoms. Mice with a poor transcriptional
response of GR dimer-dependent target genes were studied in a model of
TNF-induced lethal inflammation. In contrast to the GRWT/WT mice, these GRdim/dim
mice displayed a substantial increase in TNF sensitivity and a lack of protection
by the GC dexamethasone (DEX). Unchallenged GRdim/dim mice had a strong
IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) signature, along with STAT1 upregulation and
phosphorylation. This ISG signature was gut specific and, based on our studies
with antibiotics, depended on the gut microbiota. GR dimers directly bound to
short DNA sequences in the STAT1 promoter known as inverted repeat negative GRE
(IR-nGRE) elements. Poor control of STAT1 in GRdim/dim mice led to failure to
repress ISG genes, resulting in excessive necroptosis induction by TNF. Our
findings support a critical interplay among gut microbiota, IFNs, necroptosis,
and GR in both the basal response to acute inflammatory challenges and
pharmacological intervention by GCs.

Background: Transmembrane tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors are involved in
inflammatory, apoptotic, and proliferative processes. In the bloodstream, soluble
TNF receptor II (sTNFR2) can modify the inflammatory response of immune cells and
is predictive of cardiovascular disease risk. We hypothesize that sTNFR2 is
associated with epigenetic modifications of circulating leukocytes, which may
relate to the pathophysiology underlying atherogenic risk. Methods: We conducted 
an epigenome-wide association study of sTNFR2 levels in the Framingham Heart
Study Offspring cohort (examination 8; 2005-2008). sTNFR2 was quantitated by
enzyme immunoassay and DNA methylation by microarray. The concentration of sTNFR2
was loge-transformed and outliers were excluded. We conducted linear mixed
effects models to test the association between sTNFR2 level and methylation at
over 400,000 CpGs, adjusting for age, sex, BMI, smoking, imputed cell count,
technical covariates, and accounting for familial relatedness. Results: The study
sample included 2468 participants (mean age: 67 ± 9 years, 52% women, mean sTNFR2
level 2661 ± 1078 pg/ml). After accounting for multiple testing, we identified
168 CpGs (P < 1.2 × 10-7) that were differentially methylated in relation to
sTNFR2. A substantial proportion (27 CpGs; 16%) are in the major
histocompatibility complex region and in loci overrepresented for antigen binding
molecular functions (P = 1.7 × 10-4) and antigen processing and presentation
biological processes (P = 1.3 × 10-8). Identified CpGs are enriched in active
regulatory regions and associated with expression of 48 cis-genes (±500 kb) in
whole blood (P < 1.1 × 10-5) that coincide with genes identified in GWAS of
diseases of immune dysregulation (inflammatory bowel disease, type 1 diabetes,
IgA nephropathy). Conclusion: Differentially methylated loci in leukocytes
associated with sTNF2 levels reside in active regulatory regions, are
overrepresented in antigen processes, and are linked to inflammatory diseases.

The aim of this research was the identification of novel pharmacogenomic
biomarkers for better understanding the complex gene regulation mechanisms
underpinning glucocorticoid (GC) action in paediatric inflammatory bowel disease 
(IBD). This goal was achieved by evaluating high-throughput microRNA (miRNA)
profiles during GC treatment, integrated with the assessment of expression
changes in GC receptor (GR) heterocomplex genes. Furthermore, we tested the
hypothesis that differentially expressed miRNAs could be directly regulated by
GCs through investigating the presence of GC responsive elements (GREs) in their 
gene promoters. Ten IBD paediatric patients responding to GCs were enrolled.
Peripheral blood was obtained at diagnosis (T0) and after four weeks of steroid
treatment (T4). MicroRNA profiles were analyzed using next generation sequencing,
and selected significantly differentially expressed miRNAs were validated by
quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In detail, 18
miRNAs were differentially expressed from T0 to T4, 16 of which were upregulated 
and 2 of which were downregulated. Out of these, three miRNAs (miR-144, miR-142, 
and miR-96) could putatively recognize the 3&rsquo;UTR of the GR gene and three
miRNAs (miR-363, miR-96, miR-142) contained GREs sequences, thereby potentially
enabling direct regulation by the GR. In conclusion, we identified miRNAs
differently expressed during GC treatment and miRNAs which could be directly
regulated by GCs in blood cells of young IBD patients. These results could
represent a first step towards their translation as pharmacogenomic biomarkers.

Background: Genome-wide association studies and meta-analyses have revealed the
genetic background of ulcerative colitis (UC) by identifying common variants.
However, these variants do not fully explain the disease variance in UC. To
identify novel variants, we performed deep resequencing of UC-associated genes in
Korean UC patients and subsequently investigated the functional roles of
identified susceptibility genes.
Methods: We performed targeted deep resequencing of 108 genes in 24 Korean UC
patients and then performed association analysis with data from 126 healthy
controls. We validated these variants using 2-stage replication studies including
793 UC patients and 783 controls. We performed in silico and pathway analyses and
functional analyses.
Results: The combined analysis including 2 replication studies identified 6 novel
susceptibility loci and reconfirmed 10 previously reported loci. Among the novel 
single nucleotide variants (SNVs), rs10035653 in C5orf55 (P = 2.08 × 10-3; OR =
1.50), rs41417449 in BTNL2 (P = 1.27 × 10-2; OR = 1.32), rs3117099 in HCG23 (P = 
9.98 × 10-6; OR = 1.40), rs7192 in HLA-DRA (P = 6.95 × 10-9; OR = 1.57), and
rs3744246 in ORMDL3 (P = 2.21 × 10-2; OR = 1.21) were identified as causal
variants, whereas rs713669 in IL17REL (P = 2.69 × 10-2; OR = 0.84) as a
protective variant for UC. When correcting multiple testing, 3 novel SNVs
(rs41417449 in BTNL2, rs3744246 in ORMDL3, and rs713669 in IL17REL) and 4
previously reported SNVs did not reach a statistical significance. Functional
study suggested that SNVs of BTNL2 and C5orf55 exacerbated the inflammatory
response both in vitro and in vivo.
Conclusions: This study identified 3 novel susceptibility loci and validated 6
previously reported SNVs for UC through deep resequencing in Koreans and revealed
the functional roles of BTNL2 and C5orf55.

Background: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) afflicts 5 million people and is
increasing in prevalence. There is an unmet clinical need for safer and effective
treatments for IBD. The BT-11 is a small molecule oral therapeutic that
ameliorates IBD by targeting lanthionine synthetase C-like 2 (LANCL2) and has a
benign safety profile in rats.
Methods: Mdr1a-/-, dextran sodium sulphate , and adoptive transfer mouse models
of colitis were employed to validate therapeutic efficacy and characterize the
mechanisms of therapeutic efficacy of BT-11. In vitro cultures of CD4+ T cell
differentiation and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from Crohn's disease
patients were used to determine its potential for human translation.
Results: BT-11 reduces inflammation in multiple mouse models of IBD. Oral
treatment with BT-11 increases the numbers of lamina propria regulatory T cells
(Tregs) in a LANCL2-dependent manner. In vitro, BT-11 increases the
differentiation in Treg phenotypes, the upregulation of genes implicated in Treg 
cell stability, and conditions Treg cells to elicit greater suppressive actions. 
These immunoregulatory effects are intertwined with the ability of BT-11 to
regulate late stage glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle. Immunometabolic
mechanistic findings translate into human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from
healthy individuals and Crohn's disease patients.
Conclusions: BT-11 is a safe, efficacious oral therapeutic for IBD with a human
translatable mechanism of action that involves activation of LANCL2,
immunometabolic modulation of CD4+ T cell subsets leading to stable regulatory
phenotypes in the colonic LP.

Background: Due to common evolutionary origins, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) shares 
many similarities with immunogenic bacterial DNA. MtDNA is recognized as a
pro-inflammatory damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) with a pathogenic
role in several inflammatory diseases. We hypothesised that mtDNA is released
during active disease, serving as a key pro-inflammatory factor in inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD).
Methods: Between 2014 and 2015, we collected plasma separated within 2 hours of
sampling from 97 prospectively recruited IBD patients (67 ulcerative colitis [UC]
and 30 Crohn's disease [CD]) and 40 non-IBD controls. We measured circulating
mtDNA using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (amplifying mitochondria
COXIII/ND2 genes) and also in mouse colitis induced by dextran sulfate-sodium
(DSS). We used a mass spectometry approach to detect free plasma mitochondrial
formylated peptides. Furthermore, we examined for mitochondrial damage using
electron microscopy (EM) and TLR9 expression, the target for mtDNA, in human
intestinal IBD mucosa.
Results: Plasma mtDNA levels were increased in UC and CD (both P < 0.0001)
compared with non-IBD controls. These levels were significantly correlated to
blood (C-reactive protein, albumin, white cell count), clinical and endoscopic
markers of severity, and disease activity. In active UC, we identified 5
mitochondrial formylated peptides (the most abundant being fMMYALF with known
chemoattractant function) in plasma. We observed mitochondrial damage in inflamed
UC mucosa and significantly higher fecal MtDNA levels (vs non-IBD controls [P <
0.0001]), which supports gut mucosal mitochondrial DAMP release as the primary
source. In parallel, plasma mtDNA levels increased during induction of acute DSS 
colitis and were associated with more severe colitis (P < 0.05). In active IBD,
TLR9+ lamina propria inflammatory cells were significantly higher in UC and CD
compared with controls (P < 0.05).
Conclusions: We present the first evidence to show that mtDNA is released during 
active IBD. MtDNA is a potential mechanistic biomarker, and our data point to
mtDNA-TLR9 as a therapeutic target in IBD.

The aim of the present study was to reveal the potential molecular mechanisms of 
microsatellite instability (MSI) on the prognosis of gastric cancer (GC). The
investigation was performed based on an RNAseq expression profiling dataset
downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas, including 64 high‑level MSI (MSI‑H) GC
samples, 44 low‑level MSI (MSI‑L) GC samples and 187 stable microsatellite
(MSI‑S) GC samples. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between
the MSI‑H, MSI‑L and MSI‑S samples. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed for
the identified DEGs and the pathway deviation scores of the significant
enrichment pathways were calculated. A Multi‑Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier,
based on the different pathways associated with the MSI statuses was constructed 
for predicting the outcome of patients with GC, which was validated in another
independent dataset. A total of 190 DEGs were selected between the MSI‑H, MSI‑L
and MSI‑S samples. The MLP classifier was established based on the deviation
scores of 10 significant pathways, among which antigen processing and
presentation, and inflammatory bowel disease pathways were significantly enriched
with HLA‑DRB5, HLA‑DMA, HLA‑DQA1 and HLA‑DRA; the measles, toxoplasmosis and
herpes simplex infection pathways were significantly enriched with Janus
kinase 2 (JAK2), caspase‑8 (CASP8) and Fas. The classifier performed well on an
independent validation set with 100 GC samples. Taken together, the results
indicated that MSI status may affect GC prognosis, partly through the antigen
processing and presentation, inflammatory bowel disease, measles, toxoplasmosis
and herpes simplex infection pathways. HLA‑DRB5, HLA‑DMA, HLA‑DQA1, HLA‑DRA,
JAK2, CASP8 and Fas may be predictive factors for prognosis in GC.

AIM: To investigate the influence of high salt on dextran sulfate sodium
(DSS)-induced colitis in mice and explore the underlying mechanisms of this
effect.
METHODS: DSS and NaCl were used to establish the proinflammatory animal model. We
evaluated the colitis severity. Flow cytometry was employed for detecting the
frequencies of Th1, macrophages and Tregs in spleen, mesenteric lymph node and
lamina propria. The important role of macrophages in the promotion of DSS-induced
colitis by NaCl was evaluated by depleting macrophages with clodronate liposomes.
Activated peritoneal macrophages and lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMCs)
were stimulated with NaCl, and proteins were detected by western blotting.
Cytokines and inflammation genes were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay and RT-PCR, respectively.
RESULTS: The study findings indicate that NaCl up-regulates the frequencies of
CD11b+ macrophages and CD4+IFN-γ+IL-17+ T cells in lamina propria in DSS-treated 
mice. CD3+CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells, which can secrete high levels of IL-10 and
TGF-β, increase through feedback in NaCl- and DSS-treated mice. Furthermore,
clodronate liposomes pretreatment significantly alleviated DSS-induced colitis,
indicating that macrophages play a vital role in NaCl proinflammatory activity.
NaCl aggravates peritoneal macrophage inflammation by promoting the expressions
of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and mouse inducible nitric oxide synthase.
Specifically, high NaCl concentrations promote p38 phosphorylation in
lipopolysaccharide- and IFN-γ-activated LPMCs mediated by SGK1.
CONCLUSION: Proinflammatory macrophages may play an essential role in the onset
and development of NaCl-promoted inflammation in DSS-induced colitis. The
underlining mechanism involves up-regulation of the p38/MAPK axis.

BACKGROUND: Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) is the second most common
cancer of the head and neck. In order to identify differentially expressed genes 
which may have a role in LSCC carcinogenesis, we performed GeneFishing Assay. One
of the differentially expressed genes was the SLC22A23 (solute carrier family 22,
member 23) gene. SLC22A23 belongs to a family of organic ion transporters that
are responsible for the absorption or excretion of many drugs, xenobiotics and
endogenous compounds in a variety of tissues. SLC22A23 is expressed in a various 
tissues but no substrates or functions have been identified for it. Although the 
exact function is unknown, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which are
located in SLC22A23 gene were associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),
endometriosis-related infertility and the clearance of antipsychotic drugs. On
the other hand SLC22A23 is identified as a prognostic gene to predict the
recurrence of triple-negative breast cancer.
METHODS: To understand the role of the SLC22A23 gene in laryngeal carcinogenesis,
we investigated its mRNA expression level in laryngeal tumor tissue and adjacent 
non-cancerous tissue samples obtained from 83 patients by quantitative real-time 
PCR. To understand the association between SNPs in SLC22A23 and LSCC, selected
genetic variations (rs4959235, rs6923667, rs9503518) were genotyped.
RESULTS: We found that SLC22A23 expression was increased in 46 of 83 tumor
tissues (55.4%) and was decreased in 30 of 83 (36.1%) tumor tissues compared to
normal tissues. 77.2% of patients were homozygote for genotype rs9503518-AA and
they most frequently had histological grade 2 and 3 tumors. We also found that
rs9503518-AA genotype is associated with increased SLC22A23 expression.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that SLC22A23 may play a role in the
development of laryngeal cancer.

Lipoxygenases (ALOXs) are involved in the regulation of cellular redox
homeostasis. They also have been implicated in the biosynthesis of pro- and
anti-inflammatory lipid mediators and play a role in the pathogenesis of
inflammatory diseases, which constitute a major health challenge owing to
increasing incidence and prevalence in all industrialized countries around the
world. To explore the pathophysiological role of Alox15 (leukocyte-type 12-LOX)
in mouse experimental colitis we tested the impact of systemic inactivation of
the Alox15 gene on the extent of dextrane sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis. We found 
that in wildtype mice expression of the Alox15 gene was augmented during
DSS-colitis while expression of other Alox genes (Alox5, Alox15b) was hardly
altered. Systemic Alox15 (leukocyte-type 12-LOX) deficiency induced less severe
colitis symptoms and suppressed in vivo formation of 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic
acid (12-HETE), the major Alox15 (leukocyte-type 12-LOX) product in mice. These
alterations were paralleled by reduced expression of pro-inflammatory gene
products, by sustained expression of the zonula occludens protein 1 (ZO-1) and by
a less impaired intestinal epithelial barrier function. These results are
consistent with in vitro incubations of colon epithelial cells, in which addition
of 12S-HETE compromised enantioselectively transepithelial electric resistance.
Consistent with these data transgenic overexpression of human ALOX15 intensified 
the inflammatory symptoms. In summary, our results indicate that systemic Alox15 
(leukocyte-type 12-LOX) deficiency protects mice from DSS-colitis. Since
exogenous 12-HETE compromises the expression of the tight junction protein ZO-1
the protective effect has been related to a less pronounced impairment of the
intestinal epithelial barrier function.

Defining the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) continues to elude
researchers, in part due to the possibility that there may be different triggers 
for a spectrum of disease phenotypes that are currently classified as either
Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). What is clear is that genetic
susceptibility plays an important role in the development of IBD, and large
genome-wide association studies using case-control approaches have identified
more than 230 risk alleles. Many of these identified risk alleles are located in 
a variety of genes important in host-microbiome interactions. In spite of these
major advances, the mechanisms behind the genetic influence on disease
development remain unknown. In addition, the identified genetic risks have thus
far failed to fully define the hereditability of IBD. Host genetics influence
host interactions with the gut microbiota in maintaining health through a balance
of regulated immune responses and coordinated microbial composition and function.
What remains to be defined is how alterations in these interactions can lead to
disease. The nature and cause of changes in the microbiota in patients with IBD
are poorly understood. In spite of the large catalog of alterations in the
microbiota of IBD patients, inflammation itself can alter the microbiota, leaving
open the question of which is cause or effect. The composition and function of
the gut microbiota are influenced by many factors, including environmental
factors, dietary factors, and, as recent studies have shown, host genetic makeup.
More than 200 loci have shown potential to influence the microbiota, but
replication and larger studies are still required to validate these findings. It 
would seem reasonable to consider the combination of both host genetic makeup and
the inheritance of the microbiota as interdependent heritable forces that could
explain the nature of an individual's susceptibility to IBD or indeed the actual 
cause of IBD. In this review, we will consider the contribution of the host
genetics, the microbiome, and the influence of host genetics on the microbiota to
the heritability of IBD.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic intestinal disorder, with two main 
types: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), whose molecular
pathology is not well understood. The majority of IBD-associated SNPs are located
in non-coding regions and are hard to characterize since regulatory regions in
IBD are not known. Here we profile transcription start sites (TSSs) and enhancers
in the descending colon of 94 IBD patients and controls. IBD-upregulated
promoters and enhancers are highly enriched for IBD-associated SNPs and are bound
by the same transcription factors. IBD-specific TSSs are associated to genes with
roles in both inflammatory cascades and gut epithelia while TSSs distinguishing
UC and CD are associated to gut epithelia functions. We find that as few as 35
TSSs can distinguish active CD, UC, and controls with 85% accuracy in an
independent cohort. Our data constitute a foundation for understanding the
molecular pathology, gene regulation, and genetics of IBD.

Background: The human gut microbiota is a dynamic community of microorganisms
that mediate important biochemical processes. Differences in the gut microbial
composition have been associated with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and other
intestinal disorders. In this study, we quantified and compared the frequencies
of eight genotoxic and/or pro-inflammatory bacterial genes found in metagenomic
Whole Genome Sequences (mWGSs) of samples from individuals with IBD vs. a cohort 
of healthy human subjects. Methods: The eight selected gene sequences were clbN, 
clbB, cif, cnf-1, usp, tcpC from Escherichia coli, gelE from Enterococcus
faecalis and murB from Akkermansia muciniphila. We also included the sequences
for the conserved murB genes from E. coli and E. faecalis as markers for the
presence of Enterobacteriaceae or Enterococci in the samples. The gene sequences 
were chosen based on their previously reported ability to disrupt normal cellular
processes to either promote inflammation or to cause DNA damage in cultured cells
or animal models, which could be linked to a role in IBD. The selected sequences 
were searched in three different mWGS datasets accessed through the Human
Microbiome Project (HMP): a healthy cohort (N = 251), a Crohn's disease cohort (N
= 60) and an ulcerative colitis cohort (N = 17). Results: Firstly, the sequences 
for the murB housekeeping genes from Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococci were more
frequently found in the IBD cohorts (32% E. coli in IBD vs. 12% in healthy; 13%
E. faecalis in IBD vs. 3% in healthy) than in the healthy cohort, confirming
earlier reports of a higher presence of both of these taxa in IBD. For some of
the sequences in our study, especially usp and gelE, their frequency was even
more sharply increased in the IBD cohorts than in the healthy cohort, suggesting 
an association with IBD that is not easily explained by the increased presence of
E. coli or E. faecalis in those samples. Conclusion: Our results suggest a
significant association between the presence of some of these genotoxic or
pro-inflammatory gene sequences and IBDs. In addition, these results illustrate
the power and limitations of the HMP database in the detection of possible
clinical correlations for individual bacterial genes.

Nfκb2(p52/p100) plays essential roles in many chronic inflammatory diseases.
Tracing the dynamic expression of Nfκb2 during different biological processes
in vivo can provide valuable clues to understand the biological functions of this
gene and develop anti-inflammatory drugs. In this study, B6-Tg(Nfκb2-luc)Mlit
transgenic mouse line, a mouse model in which the expression of firefly
luciferase gene is under the control of a 14.6-kb mouse Nfκb2 promoter, was
generated to monitor the expression of p52/p100 in vivo. Bioluminescence imaging 
was used for tracking the luciferase signal in living mice in a variety of
inflammatory processes, including LPS-induced sepsis and inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD). The data of in vivo bioluminescence imaging in this mouse model
showed that luciferase activity coincided with the endogenous p52/p100
expression. Moreover, dexamethasone or aspirin, two routine anti-inflammatory
drugs, could decrease the high-level expression of luciferase induced by LPS.
Overall, our results suggest that the B6-Tg(Nfκb2-luc)Mlit mice represent a
valuable reporter mouse model not only to monitor the expression of p52/p100 in
physiological or pathological processes but also to evaluate the effects of
various anti-inflammatory drug treatments in vivo.

Spondyloarthritis is a common type of arthritis which affects mostly adults. It
consists of idiopathic chronic inflammation of the spine, joints, eyes, skin,
gut, and prostate. Inflammation is often asymptomatic, especially in the gut and 
prostate. The HLA-B*27 allele group, which presents intracellular peptides to
CD8+ T cells, is by far the strongest risk factor for spondyloarthritis. The
precise mechanisms and antigens remain unknown. In 1959, Catterall and King
advanced a novel hypothesis explaining the etiology of spondyloarthritis: an
as-yet-unrecognized sexually acquired microbe would be causing all
spondyloarthritis types, including acute anterior uveitis. Recent studies suggest
an unrecognized sexually acquired fungal infection may be involved in prostate
cancer and perhaps multiple sclerosis. This warrants reanalyzing the
Catterall-King hypothesis based on the current literature. In the last decade,
many links between spondyloarthritis and fungal infections have been found.
Antibodies against the fungal cell wall component mannan are elevated in
spondyloarthritis. Functional polymorphisms in genes regulating the innate immune
response against fungi have been associated with spondyloarthritis (CARD9 and
IL23R). Psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease, two common comorbidities of
spondyloarthritis, are both strongly associated with fungi. Evidence reviewed
here lends credence to the Catterall-King hypothesis and implicates a common
fungal etiology in prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia, multiple
sclerosis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, and spondyloarthritis. However,
the evidence available at this time is insufficient to definitely confirm this
hypothesis. Future studies investigating the microbiome in relation to these
conditions should screen specimens for fungi in addition to bacteria. Future
clinical studies of spondyloarthritis should consider antifungals which are
effective in psoriasis and multiple sclerosis, such as dimethyl fumarate and
nystatin.

Background and Aims: Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the
intestine and often leads to fibrosis, characterized by excess extracellular
matrix [ECM] deposition, increased tissue stiffness, and stricture formation.
Here we evaluated the contribution of myofibroblast-ECM interactions to the
development of intestinal fibrosis in Crohn's disease.
Methods: Matched primary human myofibroblasts were isolated from stenotic,
inflamed and normal-appearing small intestine within the same Crohn's disease
patient [n = 10]. Cells were analyzed by gene expression profiling, microscopy
and functional assays, including matrix metalloproteinase [MMP] production and
ECM contraction.
Results: We demonstrated that myofibroblasts isolated from stenotic intestine
differed both in phenotype and function from those isolated from purely
inflammatory or normal-appearing intestine of the same patient. Stenotic
myofibroblasts displayed increased expression of genes associated with ECM
modulation and collagen deposition. Upon culture in a fibrotic environment,
normal myofibroblasts increased expression of MMPs to counteract the mechanical
force exerted by the matrix. Interestingly, stenotic myofibroblasts showed a
paradoxical response with decreased expression of MMP3. In addition, stenotic
myofibroblasts expressed increased levels of the collagen crosslinking enzyme
lysyl oxidase [LOX] and induced significantly more ECM contraction than both
normal and inflamed myofibroblasts. Importantly, LOX inhibition completely
restored MMP3 activity in stenotic myofibroblasts grown in a fibrotic
environment, and prevented excessive ECM contraction.
Conclusions: Together these data indicate aberrancies in the myofibroblast-ECM
interaction in Crohn's disease, and identify LOX inhibition as a potential
anti-fibrotic agent in this condition.

T lymphocytes represent an important part of adaptive immune system undertaking
different functions to regulate immune responses. CD4+ T cells are the most
important activator cells in inflammatory conditions. Depending on the type of
induced cells and inflamed sites, expression and activity of different subtypes
of helper T cells are changed. Recent studies have confirmed the existence of a
new subset of helper T lymphocytes called Th9. Naive T cells can differentiate
into Th9 subtypes if they are exposed simultaneously by interleukin (IL) 4 and
transforming growth factor β and also secondary activation of a complicated
network of transcription factors such as interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4)
and Smads which are essential for adequate induction of this phenotype. Th9 cells
specifically produce interleukin 9 and their probable roles in promoting
intestinal inflammation are being investigated in human subjects and experimental
models of ulcerative colitis (UC). Recently, infiltration of Th9 cells,
overexpression of IL-9, and certain genes associated with Th9 differentiation
have been demonstrated in inflammatory microenvironment of UC. Intestinal
oversecretion of IL-9 protein is likely to break down epithelial barriers and
compromise tolerance to certain commensal microorganisms which leads to
inflammation. Th9 pathogenicity has not yet been adequately explored in UC and
they are far from being considered as inflammatory cells in this milieu,
therefore precise understanding the role of these newly identified cells in
particular their potential role in gut pathogenesis may enable us to develop
novel therapeutic approaches for inflammatory bowel disease. So, this article
tries to discuss the latest knowledge on the above-mentioned field.

Background: Anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFα) therapy has become the
mainstay of therapy for Crohn's disease (CD). However, post-therapy, the
recurrence rate is still high. The aim of this study was to dissect the molecular
mechanism for recurrence of CD treated with anti-TNFα therapy and investigate
novel therapeutic options that could induce complete remission.
Methods: We re-analyzed publicly available mucosal gene expression data from CD
patients pre- and post-infliximab therapy to extract the transcriptional
differences between responders and healthy controls. We used a systematic
computational approach based on identified differences to discover novel
therapies and validated this prediction through in vitro and in vivo
experimentation.
Results: We identified a set of 3545 anti-TNFα therapy-untreatable genes (TUGs)
that are significantly regulated in intestinal epithelial cells, which remain
altered during remission. Pathway enrichment analysis of these genes clearly
showed excessive growth state and suppressed terminal differentiation, whereas
immune components were clearly resolved. Through in silico screening strategy, we
observed that MEK inhibitors were predicted to revert expression of genes
dysregulated in infliximab responders. In vitro transcriptome analysis
demonstrated that selective MEK1/2 inhibitor significantly normalized reference
genes from TUGs. In addition, in vitro functional study proved that MEK1/2
inhibitor facilitated intestinal epithelial differentiation. Finally, using
murine colitis model, administration of MEK1/2 inhibitor significantly improved
diarrhea and histological score.
Conclusions: Our data revealed the abnormalities in anti-TNFα responders' CD
colons that would be cause of recurrence of CD. Also, we provided evidence
regarding MEK1/2 inhibitor as a potential treatment against CD to achieve
sustainable remission.

BACKGROUND: Zymogen granule protein 16 (ZG16) is one of the most significantly
down-regulated genes in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues. This study aimed to
further evaluate its expression changes and investigate its association with
molecular and clinicopathological characteristics of CRC.
METHODS: We applied quantitative RT-PCR to determine expression difference
between tumor and matched normal tissues from 23 CRC patients. To further
validate the down-regulation in tumor tissues, we performed immunohistochemistry 
(IHC) analysis in 40 paraffin-embedded normal-tumor pairs and 22 colon tissues
with a variety of diseases. To evaluate if the ZG16 gene changes were associated 
with clinicopathological characteristics, we further analyzed the gene expression
and copy number changes from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Oncomine
datasets.
RESULTS: Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed significant down-regulation (~ 130-fold)
of ZG16 in all tumor tissues. ZG16 expression was in an organ-specific manner
with an extremely high expression in normal epithelial cells of small intestine, 
colon and rectum. IHC analysis showed that ZG16 protein was completely lost in
all of 40 CRC tissues, and partially lost in premalignant adenomatous polyps
(adenomas) and chronic ulcerative colitis tissues. Gene expression and copy
number changes were significantly associated with multiple molecular and
clinicopathological features of CRC including microsatellite instability (MSI),
MLH1 silencing, CpG island methylator phenotype, hyper-mutation status, gender,
presence of synchronous adenomas, and histological type (P < 0.05). Patients with
lower ZG16 gene expression showed shorter progression-free survival and overall
survival than those with relatively higher expression (P < 0.05). Multivariate
analysis suggested that the ZG16 expression was an independent prognosis factor
(P = 0.012, HR = 6.286, 95% CI = 0.816-0.975).
CONCLUSION: For the first time, our study demonstrated that ZG16 expression was
sequentially reduced from normal, adenoma, to carcinoma. Association with
multiple clinicopathological features indicates that ZG16 may play an important
role in cancer initiation and progression. ZG16 may serve as a potential
biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis of CRC.

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its components are used for the prevention
and treatment of enteric disease in different species; therefore, they may also
be useful for preventing Johne's disease, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease of
ruminants caused by Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis (MAP). The
objective of this study was to identify potential immunomodulatory S. cerevisiae 
components using a bovine macrophage cell line (BOMAC). The BOMAC phagocytic
activity, reactive oxygen species production, and immune-related gene (IL6, IL10,
IL12p40, IL13, IL23), transforming growth factor β, ARG1, CASP1, and inducible
nitric oxide synthase expression were investigated when BOMAC were cocultured
with cell wall components from 4 different strains (A, B, C, and D) and 2 forms
of dead yeast from strain A. The BOMAC phagocytosis of mCherry-labeled MAP was
concentration-dependently attenuated when BOMAC were cocultured with yeast
components for 6 h. Each yeast derivative also induced a concentration-dependent 
increase in BOMAC reactive oxygen species production after a 6-h exposure. In
addition, BOMAC mRNA expression of the immune-related genes was investigated
after 6 and 24 h of exposure to yeast components. All yeast components were found
to regulate the immunomodulatory genes of BOMAC; however, the response varied
among components and over time. The in vitro bioassessment studies reported here 
suggest that dead yeast and its cell wall components may be useful for modulating
macrophage function before or during MAP infection.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) consists of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's 
disease (CD). Natural killer cell responses play a crucial role in autoimmune
disease through innate immunity, in which killer cell immunoglobulin-like
receptors (KIRs) are closely involved. Although the genetic combination of KIRs
with their specific HLA class I ligands has been associated with IBD in
Caucasians, such KIR-HLA receptor-ligand combinations are not fully understood in
the Japanese. We investigated 14 KIR genes along with HLA-Bw and -C ligands in 90
patients with UC and 50 patients with CD and compared them with the
characteristics of 325 healthy control subjects. The frequency of HLA-Bw4 was
significantly increased in patients with UC (P = 1.3 × 10-6; odds ratio [OR] =
3.39) and CD (P = 0.0065; OR = 2.32) versus controls. The UC group had a
significantly higher frequency of KIR2DS3 (P = 0.024; OR = 1.94) and lower
frequency of KIR2DS4 (P = 0.019; OR = 0.40) and KIR2DL1-HLA-C2 (P = 0.035; OR =
0.47). The Tel-A/B haplotype was significantly decreased in UC patients (P =
0.0056; OR = 0.49). The frequency of KIR3DL1-HLA-Bw4 was significantly higher in 
patients with UC (P = 4.3 × 10-6; OR = 3.12) and CD (P = 0.0067; OR = 2.30). In
conclusion, HLA-Bw4 and KIR-HLA pairs may play an important role in the genetic
susceptibility to IBD in the Japanese.

Multicellular organisms consist of multiple cell types. The identity of these
cells is primarily maintained by cell-type-specific gene expression programs;
however, mechanisms that suppress these programs are poorly defined. Here we show
that serum response factor (Srf), a transcription factor that is activated by
various extracellular stimuli, can repress cell-type-specific genes and promote
cellular reprogramming to pluripotency. Manipulations that decrease β-actin
monomer quantity result in the nuclear accumulation of Mkl1 and the activation of
Srf, which downregulate cell-type-specific genes and alter the epigenetics of
regulatory regions and chromatin organization. Mice overexpressing Srf exhibit
various pathologies including an ulcerative colitis-like symptom and a
metaplasia-like phenotype in the pancreas. Our results demonstrate an unexpected 
function of Srf via a mechanism by which extracellular stimuli actively
destabilize cell identity and suggest Srf involvement in a wide range of
diseases.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Inflammation affects regeneration of the intestinal epithelia;
long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate cell functions, such as proliferation,
differentiation, and migration. We investigated the mechanisms by which the
lncRNA H19, imprinted maternally expressed transcript (H19) regulates
regeneration of intestinal epithelium using cell cultures and mouse models of
inflammation.
METHODS: We performed RNA-sequencing transcriptome analyses of intestinal tissues
from mice with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis to identify lncRNAs
associated with inflammation; findings were confirmed by quantitative real-time
polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization analyses of intestinal
tissues from mice with sepsis or dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced mucosal
wound healing and patients with ulcerative colitis compared to healthy
individuals (controls). We screened cytokines for their ability to induce
expression of H19 in HT-29 cells and intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), and
confirmed findings in crypt epithelial organoids derived from mouse small
intestine. IECs were incubated with different signal transduction inhibitors and 
effects on H19 lncRNA levels were measured. We assessed intestinal epithelial
proliferation or regeneration in H19ΔEx1/+ mice given LPS or DSS vs wild-type
littermates (control mice). H19 was overexpressed in IECs using lentiviral
vectors and cell proliferation was measured. We performed RNA antisense
purification, RNA immunoprecipitation, and luciferase reporter assays to study
functions of H19 in IECs.
RESULTS: In RNA-sequencing transcriptome analysis of lncRNA expression in
intestinal tissues from mice, we found that levels of H19 lncRNA changed
significantly with LPS exposure. Levels of H19 lncRNA increased in intestinal
tissues of patients with ulcerative colitis, mice with LPS-induced and
polymicrobial sepsis, or mice with DSS-induced colitis, compared with controls.
Increased H19 lncRNA localized to epithelial cells in the intestine, regardless
of Lgr5 messenger RNA expression. Exposure of IECs to interleukin 22 (IL22)
increased levels of H19 lncRNA with time and dose, which required STAT3 and
protein kinase A activity. IL22 induced expression of H19 in mouse intestinal
epithelial organoids within 6 hours. Exposure to IL22 increased growth of
intestinal epithelial organoids derived from control mice, but not H19ΔEx1/+
mice. Overexpression of H19 in HT-29 cells increased their proliferation.
Intestinal mucosa healed more slowly after withdrawal of DSS from H19ΔEx1/+ mice 
vs control mice. Crypt epithelial cells from H19ΔEx1/+ mice proliferated more
slowly than those from control mice after exposure to LPS. H19 lncRNA bound to
p53 and microRNAs that inhibit cell proliferation, including microRNA 34a and
let-7; H19 lncRNA binding blocked their function, leading to increased expression
of genes that promote regeneration of the epithelium.
CONCLUSIONS: The level of lncRNA H19 is increased in inflamed intestinal tissues 
from mice and patients. The inflammatory cytokine IL22 induces expression of H19 
in IECs, which is required for intestinal epithelial proliferation and mucosal
healing. H19 lncRNA appears to inhibit p53 protein and microRNA 34a and let-7 to 
promote proliferation of IECs and epithelial regeneration.

AIM: To study the relationship between the genotype and the phenotype in the
patients with Hermansky - Pudlak syndrome (HPS) associated with granulomatous
colitis; to monitor clinical course of the disease for adequate treatment, cancer
surveillance and genetic counseling.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The diagnosis of HPS is established by physical
examination, chest X-ray, computed tomography, endoscopic examination with
biopsy, and laboratory tests, including histology, baseline laboratory blood,
urine and feces tests, determination of ASCA-C and ANCA antibodies using an
ELISA. Molecular genetic testing for HPS gene mutations, R702W, G908R, L1007fs
and P268S mutations in NOD2 gene, and TaqI variant of the VDR gene were carried
out.
RESULTS: We report 2 cases of HPS from unrelated families. Both were complicated 
by inflammatory bowel disease with pathologic features of Crohn's disease
refractory to antibiotics and corticosteroids. One patient (family 1)
with Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry had pathogenic variant of the HPS-4 gene in exon
8, mutation P268S of NOD2 genes and "Tt" genotype of TaqI variant of the VDR
gene. Another patient (family 2) carried two mutations P268S and G908R of
NOD2 gene, and had a large paraovarian cyst diagnosed. No consistent success with
the standard medical therapy, used for treating granulomatous colitis, associated
with HPS, in presented cases was achieved. Patients needed surgical interventions
at a young age and a long-term surveillance of the probable development of tumors
and other complications. Azathioprine at 2 mg/kg/day and mesalazine 3 g/day were 
used with some positive effect for prevention of Crohn's disease postoperative
recurrence.
CONCLUSION: The occurrence of perianal lesions, the histopathological findings
and the results of the molecular genetic analysis confirmed the mutations P268S
and G908R of NOD2 gene in these cases suggest that HPS was truly associated with 
Crohn's disease variant with early onset and severe course. The search for the
molecular causes of the disease in some individuals may help in the development
of new therapeutic and surgical approaches, as well in the improvement of
understanding of premalignant inflammatory conditions in a large bowel.

In the United States, approximately 5% of individuals with inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD) are younger than 20 years old. Studies of pediatric cohorts can
provide unique insights into genetic architecture of IBD, which includes Crohn's 
disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Large genome-wide association studies
have found more than 200 IBD-associated loci but explain a minority of disease
variance for CD and UC. We sought to characterize the contribution of rare
variants to disease development, comparing exome sequencing of 368 pediatric IBD 
patients to publicly available exome sequencing (dbGaP) and aggregate frequency
data (ExAC). Using dbGaP data, we performed logistic regression for common
variants and optimal unified association tests (SKAT-O) for rare,
likely-deleterious variants. We further compared rare variants to ExAC counts
with Fisher's exact tests. We did pathway enrichment analysis on the most
significant genes from each comparison. Many variants overlapped with known
IBD-associated genes (e.g. NOD2). Rare variants were enriched in CD-associated
loci (p = 0.009) and showed suggestive enrichment in neutrophil function genes
(p = 0.05). Pathway enrichment implicated immune-related pathways, especially
cell killing and apoptosis. Variants in extracellular matrix genes also emerged
as an important theme in our analysis.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Mesalamine is commonly used to treat ulcerative colitis
(UC). Although mesalamine acts topically, in vitro data suggest that
intracellular transport is required for its beneficial effect. Genetic variants
in mucosal transport proteins may affect this uptake, but the clinical relevance 
of these variants has not been studied. The aim of this study was to determine
whether variants in genes involved in cellular transport affect the response to
mesalamine in UC.
METHODS: Subjects with UC from a 6-week clinical trial using multiple doses of
mesalamine were genotyped using a genome-wide array that included common exome
variants. Analysis focused on cellular transport gene variants with a minor
allele frequency >5%. Mesalamine response was defined as improvement in Week 6
Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) and non-response as a lack of improvement in 
Week 6 PGA. Quality control thresholds included an individual genotyping rate of 
>90%, SNP genotyping rate of >98%, and exclusion for subjects with cryptic
relatedness. All included variants met Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p>0.001).
RESULTS: 457 adults with UC were included with 280 responders and 177
non-responders. There were no common variants in transporter genes that were
associated with response to mesalamine. The genetic risk score of responders was 
similar to that of non-responders (p = 0.18). Genome-wide variants demonstrating 
a trend towards mesalamine response included ST8SIA5 (p = 1x10-5).
CONCLUSIONS: Common transporter gene variants did not affect response to
mesalamine in adult UC. The response to mesalamine may be due to rare genetic
events or environmental factors such as the intestinal microbiome.

AIM: To investigate disease-specific gene expression profiles of peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from Crohn's disease (CD) patients in clinical
remission.
METHODS: Patients with CD in clinical remission or with very low disease activity
according to the Crohn's disease activity index were genotyped regarding
nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2), and PBMCs from wild-type
(WT)-NOD2 patients, patients with homozygous or heterozygous NOD2 mutations and
healthy donors were isolated for further analysis. The cells were cultured with
vitamin D, peptidoglycan (PGN) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for defined periods
of time before RNA was isolated and subjected to microarray analysis using
Clariom S assays and quantitative real-time PCR. NOD2- and disease-specific gene 
expression profiles were evaluated with repeated measure ANOVA by a general
linear model.
RESULTS: Employing microarray assays, a total of 267 genes were identified that
were significantly up- or downregulated in PBMCs of WT-NOD2 patients, compared to
healthy donors after challenge with vitamin D and/or a combination of LPS and PGN
(P < 0.05; threshold: ≥ 2-fold change). For further analysis by real-time PCR,
genes with known impact on inflammation and immunity were selected that fulfilled
predefined expression criteria. In a larger cohort of patients and controls, a
disease-associated expression pattern, with higher transcript levels in vitamin
D-treated PBMCs from patients, was observed for three of these genes, CLEC5A (P <
0.030), lysozyme (LYZ; P < 0.047) and TREM1 (P < 0.023). Six genes were found to 
be expressed in a NOD2-dependent manner (CD101, P < 0.002; CLEC5A, P < 0.020;
CXCL5, P < 0.009; IL-24, P < 0.044; ITGB2, P < 0.041; LYZ, P < 0.042).
Interestingly, the highest transcript levels were observed in patients with
heterozygous NOD2 mutations.
CONCLUSION: Our data identify CLEC5A and LYZ as CD- and NOD2-associated genes of 
PBMCs and encourage further studies on their pathomechanistic roles.

Peripheral factors likely play a role in at least a subset of irritable bowel
syndrome (IBS) patients. Few studies have investigated mucosal gene expression
using an unbiased approach. Here, we performed mucosal gene profiling in a
sex-balanced sample to identify relevant signaling pathways and gene networks and
compare with publicly available profiling data from additional cohorts. Twenty
Rome III+ IBS patients [10 IBS with constipation (IBS-C), 10 IBS with diarrhea
(IBS-D), 5 men/women each), and 10 age-/sex-matched healthy controls (HCs)]
underwent sigmoidoscopy with biopsy for gene microarray analysis, including
differential expression, weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA),
gene set enrichment analysis, and comparison with publicly available data.
Expression levels of 67 genes were validated in an expanded cohort, including the
above samples and 18 additional participants (6 each of IBS-C, IBS-D, HCs) using 
NanoString nCounter technology. There were 1,270 differentially expressed genes
(FDR < 0.05) in IBS-C vs. HCs but none in IBS or IBS-D vs. HCs. WGNCA analysis
identified activation of the cAMP/protein kinase A signaling pathway. Nine of 67 
genes were validated by the NanoString nCounter technology (FDR < 0.05) in the
expanded sample. Comparison with publicly available microarray data from the Mayo
Clinic and University of Nottingham supports the reproducibility of 17 genes from
the microarray analysis and three of nine genes validated by nCounter in IBS-C
vs. HCs. This study supports the involvement of peripheral mechanisms in IBS-C,
particularly pathways mediating neuronal signaling. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Peripheral
factors play a role in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS),
which, to date, has been mostly evident in IBS with diarrhea. Here, we show that 
sigmoid colon mucosal gene expression profiles differentiate IBS with
constipation from healthy controls. These profiling data and analysis of
additional cohorts also support the concept that peripheral neuronal pathways
contribute to IBS pathophysiology.

BACKGROUNDS: Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in economically
developed countries. Molecular studies and, in particular, gene expression have
contributed to advances in the diagnosis and treatment of many cancers. Genes can
be molecular and therapeutic markers, but because of the large molecular
diversity in colorectal cancer the knowledge is not yet fully established.
Probably one of the most crucial processes during early cancer development is
inflammation. The inflammatory response in the tumor is an important indicator of
molecular etiology and later of cancer progression.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work is to identify potential biomarkers for early
stage of colorectal adenocarcinoma in patients' bowel tissues using
transcriptomic analysis.
METHODS: Expression of the inflammatory response genes of colorectal cancer at
all clinical stages (I-IV) and control of the bowel were evaluated by
oligonucleotide microarrays.
RESULTS: Based on statistical analysis many differentially expressed genes were
selected. LCK (LCK Proto-Oncogene, Src Family Tyrosine Kinase), GNLY
(granulysin), SLC6A6 (Solute-Carrier Family 6 Member 6) and LAMP2 (Lysosomal
Associated Membrane Protein 2) were specific for the early stage of the disease. 
These genes had the properties of the good biomarkers.
CONCLUSIONS: The expression of LCK, GNLY, SLC6A6 and LAMP2 genes could be
valuable potential diagnostic biomarkers of the early stage of colorectal
adenocarcinoma.

Protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an essential cell function. 
To safeguard this process in the face of environmental threats and internal
stressors, cells mount an evolutionarily conserved response known as the unfolded
protein response (UPR). Invading pathogens induce cellular stress that impacts
protein folding, thus the UPR is well situated to sense danger and contribute to 
immune responses. Cytokines (inflammatory cytokines and interferons) critically
mediate host defense against pathogens, but when aberrantly produced, may also
drive pathologic inflammation. The UPR influences cytokine production on multiple
levels, from stimulation of pattern recognition receptors, to modulation of
inflammatory signaling pathways, and the regulation of cytokine transcription
factors. This review will focus on the mechanisms underlying cytokine regulation 
by the UPR, and the repercussions of this relationship for infection and
autoimmune/autoinflammatory diseases. Interrogation of viral and bacterial
infections has revealed increasing numbers of examples where pathogens induce or 
modulate the UPR and implicated UPR-modulated cytokines in host response. The
flip side of this coin, the UPR/ER stress responses have been increasingly
recognized in a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Examples include
monogenic disorders of ER function, diseases linked to misfolding protein
(HLA-B27 and spondyloarthritis), diseases directly implicating UPR and autophagy 
genes (inflammatory bowel disease), and autoimmune diseases targeting highly
secretory cells (e.g., diabetes). Given the burgeoning interest in
pharmacologically targeting the UPR, greater discernment is needed regarding how 
the UPR regulates cytokine production during specific infections and autoimmune
processes, and the relative place of this interaction in pathogenesis.

Subtraction hybridization identified genes displaying differential expression as 
metastatic human melanoma cells terminally differentiated and lost tumorigenic
properties by treatment with recombinant fibroblast interferon and mezerein. This
approach permitted cloning of multiple genes displaying enhanced expression when 
melanoma cells terminally differentiated, called melanoma differentiation
associated (mda) genes. One mda gene, mda-7, has risen to the top of the list
based on its relevance to cancer and now inflammation and other pathological
states, which based on presence of a secretory sequence, chromosomal location,
and an IL-10 signature motif has been named interleukin-24 (MDA-7/IL-24).
Discovered in the early 1990s, MDA-7/IL-24 has proven to be a potent, near
ubiquitous cancer suppressor gene capable of inducing cancer cell death through
apoptosis and toxic autophagy in cancer cells in vitro and in preclinical animal 
models in vivo. In addition, MDA-7/IL-24 embodied profound anticancer activity in
a Phase I/II clinical trial following direct injection with an adenovirus
(Ad.mda-7; INGN-241) in tumors in patients with advanced cancers. In multiple
independent studies, MDA-7/IL-24 has been implicated in many pathological states 
involving inflammation and may play a role in inflammatory bowel disease,
psoriasis, cardiovascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, tuberculosis, and viral 
infection. This review provides an up-to-date review on the multifunctional gene 
mda-7/IL-24, which may hold potential for the therapy of not only cancer, but
also other pathological states.

The intestinal immune system can respond to invading pathogens yet maintain
immune tolerance to self-antigens and microbiota. Myeloid cells are central to
these processes, but the signaling pathways that underlie tolerance versus
inflammation are unclear. Here we show that mice lacking Calcineurin B in
CD11chighMHCII+ cells (Cnb1 CD11c mice) spontaneously develop intestinal
inflammation and are susceptible to induced colitis. In these mice, colitis is
associated with expansion of T helper type 1 (Th1) and Th17 cell populations and 
a decrease in the number of FoxP3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells, and the pathology
is linked to the inability of intestinal Cnb1-deficient CD11chighMHCII+ cells to 
express IL-2. Deleting IL-2 in CD11chighMHCII+ cells induces spontaneous colitis 
resembling human inflammatory bowel disease. Our findings identify that the
calcineurin-NFAT-IL-2 pathway in myeloid cells is a critical regulator of
intestinal homeostasis by influencing the balance of inflammatory and regulatory 
responses in the mouse intestine.

BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has an unknown etiology; however,
accumulating evidence suggests that IBD is a multifactorial disease influenced by
a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The influence of genetic
variants on DNA methylation in cis and cis effects on expression have been
demonstrated. We hypothesized that IBD susceptibility single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) regulate susceptibility gene expressions in cis by
regulating DNA methylation around SNPs. For this, we determined cis-regulated
allele-specific DNA methylation (ASM) around IBD susceptibility genes in CD4+
effector/memory T cells (Tem) in lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMCs) in
patients with IBD and examined the association between the ASM SNP genotype and
neighboring susceptibility gene expressions.
METHODS: CD4+ effector/memory T cells (Tem) were isolated from LPMCs in 15
Japanese IBD patients (ten Crohn's disease [CD] and five ulcerative colitis [UC] 
patients). ASM analysis was performed by methylation-sensitive SNP array
analysis. We defined ASM as a changing average relative allele score ([Formula:
see text]) >0.1 after digestion by methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes.
Among SNPs showing [Formula: see text] >0.1, we extracted the probes located on
tag-SNPs of 200 IBD susceptibility loci and around IBD susceptibility genes as
candidate ASM SNPs. To validate ASM, bisulfite-pyrosequencing was performed.
Transcriptome analysis was examined in 11 IBD patients (seven CD and four UC
patients). The relation between rs36221701 genotype and neighboring gene
expressions were analyzed.
RESULTS: We extracted six candidate ASM SNPs around IBD susceptibility genes. The
top of [Formula: see text] (0.23) was rs1130368 located on HLA-DQB1. ASM around
rs36221701 ([Formula: see text] = 0.14) located near SMAD3 was validated using
bisulfite pyrosequencing. The SMAD3 expression was significantly associated with 
the rs36221701 genotype (p = 0.016).
CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed the existence of cis-regulated ASM around IBD
susceptibility genes and the association between ASM SNP (rs36221701) genotype
and SMAD3 expression, a susceptibility gene for IBD. These results give us
supporting evidence that DNA methylation mediates genetic effects on disease
susceptibility.

Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) hold great promise for the
treatment of inflammatory bowel disease owing to their immunosuppressive property
and tissue healing potential. The balance between regulatory T cells (Tregs) and 
T helper (Th)17 cells plays a crucial role in BMSC-mediated immunosuppression.
Interleukin (IL)-35 is a newly identified anti-inflammatory cytokine required for
the expansion of Tregs and suppression of Th17 cell differentiation. IL-35 can
amplify the immunosuppressive property of BMSCs when overexpressed in these
cells. However, the reparative capability of BMSCs in vivo is limited, partly due
to the poor homing efficiency of BMSCs to inflamed colons. Up-regulation of CXC
chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) expression in BMSCs may affect the directional
homing of implanted BMSCs via stromal-derived factor-1. In this study, by
lentivirus-mediated introduction of CXCR4 and IL-35 genes to modify rat BMSCs, we
observed enhanced migration and strengthened immunomodulatory activities of the
genetically engineering BMSCs. These results suggest that modification of BMSCs
by dual expression of CXCR4 and IL-35 may provide an effective therapeutic
strategy for inflammatory bowel disease.

Biological redundancy ensures robustness in living organisms at several levels,
from genes to organs. In this review, we explore the concept of redundancy and
robustness through an analysis of the caecal appendix, an organ that is often
considered to be a redundant remnant of evolution. However, phylogenic data show 
that the Appendix was selected during evolution and is unlikely to disappear once
it appeared. In humans, it is highly conserved and malformations are extremely
rare, suggesting a role for that structure. The Appendix could perform a dual
role. First, it is a concentrate of lymphoid tissue resembling Peyer's patches
and is the primary site for immunoglobulin A production which is crucial to
regulate the density and quality of the intestinal flora. Second, given its shape
and position, the Appendix could be a unique niche for commensal bacteria in the 
body. It is extremely rich in biofilms that continuously shed bacteria into the
intestinal lumen. The Appendix contains a microbiota as diverse as that found in 
the colon and could replenish the large intestine with healthy flora after a
diarrhea episode. In conditions of modern medicine hygiene, and people live
healthy without their appendix. However, several reports suggest that the effects
of appendectomy could be subtler and associated with the development of
inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), heart disease
but also in less expected disorders such as Parkinson's disease. Lack of an
Appendix also predicts a worsen outcome for recurrent Clostridium difficile
infection, which is the first nosocomial infection in hospitals. Here, we review 
the literature and in combination with our own data, we suggest that the Appendix
might be redundant in its immunological function but unique as a reservoir of
microbiota.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: A few rare monogenic primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) are
characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation that resembles Crohn's disease
(CD). We investigated whether 23 genes associated with 10 of these monogenic
disorders contain common, low-frequency, or rare variants that increase risk for 
CD.
METHODS: Common and low frequency variants in 1 Mb loci centered on the candidate
genes were analyzed using meta-data corresponding to genotypes of approximately
17,000 patients with CD or without CD (controls) in Europe. The contribution of
rare variants was assessed by high-throughput sequencing of 4750 individuals,
including 660 early-onset and/or familial cases among the 2390 patients with CD. 
Variants were expressed from vectors in SW480 or HeLa cells and functions of
their products were analyzed in immunofluorescence, luciferase,
immunoprecipitation, and immunoblot assays.
RESULTS: We reproduced the association of the interleukin 10 locus with CD (P =
.007), although none of the significantly associated variants modified the coding
sequence of interleukin 10. We found XIAP to be significantly enriched for rare
coding mutations in patients with CD vs controls (P = .02). We identified 4
previously unreported missense variants associated with CD. Variants in XIAP
cause the PID X-linked lymphoproliferative disease type 2, yet none of the
carriers of these variants had all the clinical features of X-linked
lymphoproliferative disease type 2. Identified XIAP variants S123N, R233Q, and
P257A were associated with an impaired activation of NOD2 signaling after muramyl
dipeptide stimulation.
CONCLUSIONS: In a systematic analysis of variants in 23 PID-associated genes, we 
confirmed the association of variants in XIAP with CD. Further screenings
for CD-associated variants and analyses of their functions could increase our
understanding of the relationship between PID-associated genes and CD
pathogenesis.

Genetic variants underlying complex traits, including disease susceptibility, are
enriched within the transcriptional regulatory elements, promoters and enhancers.
There is emerging evidence that regulatory elements associated with particular
traits or diseases share similar patterns of transcriptional activity.
Accordingly, shared transcriptional activity (coexpression) may help prioritise
loci associated with a given trait, and help to identify underlying biological
processes. Using cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) profiles of promoter- and
enhancer-derived RNAs across 1824 human samples, we have analysed coexpression of
RNAs originating from trait-associated regulatory regions using a novel
quantitative method (network density analysis; NDA). For most traits studied,
phenotype-associated variants in regulatory regions were linked to
tightly-coexpressed networks that are likely to share important functional
characteristics. Coexpression provides a new signal, independent of phenotype
association, to enable fine mapping of causative variants. The NDA coexpression
approach identifies new genetic variants associated with specific traits,
including an association between the regulation of the OCT1 cation transporter
and genetic variants underlying circulating cholesterol levels. NDA strongly
implicates particular cell types and tissues in disease pathogenesis. For
example, distinct groupings of disease-associated regulatory regions implicate
two distinct biological processes in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis; a
further two separate processes are implicated in Crohn's disease. Thus, our
functional analysis of genetic predisposition to disease defines new distinct
disease endotypes. We predict that patients with a preponderance of
susceptibility variants in each group are likely to respond differently to
pharmacological therapy. Together, these findings enable a deeper biological
understanding of the causal basis of complex traits.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disorder of the gastrointestinal
tract that has limited treatment options. To gain insight into the pathogenesis
of chronic colonic inflammation (colitis), we performed a multiomics analysis
that integrated RNA microarray, total protein mass spectrometry (MS), and
phosphoprotein MS measurements from a mouse model of the disease. Because we
collected all three types of data from individual samples, we tracked information
flow from RNA to protein to phosphoprotein and identified signaling molecules
that were coordinately or discordantly regulated and pathways that had complex
regulation in vivo. For example, the genes encoding acute-phase proteins were
expressed in the liver, but the proteins were detected by MS in the colon during 
inflammation. We also ascertained the types of data that best described
particular facets of chronic inflammation. Using gene set enrichment analysis and
trans-omics coexpression network analysis, we found that each data set provided a
distinct viewpoint on the molecular pathogenesis of colitis. Combining human
transcriptomic data with the mouse multiomics data implicated increased
p21-activated kinase (Pak) signaling as a driver of colitis. Chemical inhibition 
of Pak1 and Pak2 with FRAX597 suppressed active colitis in mice. These studies
provide translational insights into the mechanisms contributing to colitis and
identify Pak as a potential therapeutic target in IBD.

OBJECTIVE: Integration of nutritional, microbial and inflammatory events along
the gut-brain axis can alter bowel physiology and organism behaviour. Colonic
sensory neurons activate reflex pathways and give rise to conscious sensation,
but the diversity and division of function within these neurons is poorly
understood. The identification of signalling pathways contributing to visceral
sensation is constrained by a paucity of molecular markers. Here we address this 
by comprehensive transcriptomic profiling and unsupervised clustering of
individual mouse colonic sensory neurons.
DESIGN: Unbiased single-cell RNA-sequencing was performed on retrogradely traced 
mouse colonic sensory neurons isolated from both thoracolumbar (TL) and
lumbosacral (LS) dorsal root ganglia associated with lumbar splanchnic and pelvic
spinal pathways, respectively. Identified neuronal subtypes were validated by
single-cell qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Ca2+-imaging.
RESULTS: Transcriptomic profiling and unsupervised clustering of 314 colonic
sensory neurons revealed seven neuronal subtypes. Of these, five neuronal
subtypes accounted for 99% of TL neurons, with LS neurons almost exclusively
populating the remaining two subtypes. We identify and classify neurons based on 
novel subtype-specific marker genes using single-cell qRT-PCR and IHC to validate
subtypes derived from RNA-sequencing. Lastly, functional Ca2+-imaging was
conducted on colonic sensory neurons to demonstrate subtype-selective
differential agonist activation.
CONCLUSIONS: We identify seven subtypes of colonic sensory neurons using unbiased
single-cell RNA-sequencing and confirm translation of patterning to protein
expression, describing sensory diversity encompassing all modalities of colonic
neuronal sensitivity. These results provide a pathway to molecular interrogation 
of colonic sensory innervation in health and disease, together with identifying
novel targets for drug development.

BACKGROUND: The direct link between inflammatory bowel diseases and colorectal
cancer is well documented. Previous studies have reported that some lactic acid
bacterial strains could inhibit colon cancer progression however; the exact
molecules involved have not yet been identified. So, in the current study, we
illustrated the tumor suppressive effects of the newly identified Lactobacillus
acidophilus DSMZ 20079 cell-free pentasaccharide against colon cancer cells. The 
chemical structure of the purified pentasaccharide was investigated by MALDI-TOF 
mass spectrum, 1D and 2D Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). The anticancer
potentiality of the purified pentasaccharide against both Human colon cancer
(CaCo-2) and Human breast cancer (MCF7) cell lines with its safety usage pattern 
were evaluated using cytotoxicity, annexin V quantification and BrdU
incorporation assays. Also, the immunomodulatory effects of the identified
compound were quantified on both LPS-induced PBMC cell model and cancer cells
with monitoring the immunophenotyping of T and dendritic cell surface marker. At 
molecular level, the alteration in gene expression of both inflammatory and
apoptotic pathways were quantified upon pentasaccharide-cellular treatment by
RTqPCR.
RESULTS: The obtained data of the spectroscopic analysis, confirmed the structure
of the newly extracted pentasaccharide; (LA-EPS-20079) to be: α-D-Glc
(1→2)][α-L-Fuc(1→4)] α-D-GlcA(1→2) α-D-GlcA(1→2) α-D-GlcA. This pentasaccharide, 
recorded safe dose on normal mammalian cells ranged from 2 to 5 mg/ml with cancer
cells selectivity index, ranged of 1.96-51.3. Upon CaCo-2 cell treatment with the
non-toxic dose of LA-EPS-20079, the inhibition percentage in CaCo-2 cellular
viability, reached 80.65 with an increase in the ratio of the apoptotic cells in 
sub-G0/G1 cell cycle phase. Also, this pentasaccharide showed potentialities to
up-regulate the expression of IKbα, P53 and TGF genes.
CONCLUSION: The anticancer potentialities of LA-EPS-20079 oligosaccharides
against human colon cancer represented through its regulatory effects on both
apoptotic and NF-κB inflammatory pathways.

Background/Aims: Current models of Crohn's disease (CD) describe an inappropriate
immune response to gut microbiota in genetically susceptible individuals. NOD2
variants are strongly associated with development of CD, and NOD2 is part of the 
innate immune response to bacteria. This study aimed to identify differences in
fecal microbiota in CD patients and non-IBD controls stratified by NOD2 genotype.
Methods: Patients with CD and non-IBD controls of known NOD2 genotype were
identified from patients in previous UK IBD genetics studies and the Cambridge
bioresource (genotyped/phenotyped volunteers). Individuals with known
CD-associated NOD2 mutations were matched to those with wild-type genotype. We
obtained fecal samples from patients in clinical remission with low fecal
calprotectin (<250 µg/g) and controls without gastrointestinal disease. After
extracting DNA, the V1-2 region of 16S rRNA genes were polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR)-amplified and sequenced. Analysis was undertaken using the mothur package. 
Volatile organic compounds (VOC) were also measured.
Results: Ninety-one individuals were in the primary analysis (37 CD, 30
bioresource controls, and 24 household controls). Comparing CD with nonIBD
controls, there were reductions in bacterial diversity, Ruminococcaceae,
Rikenellaceae, and Christensenellaceae and an increase in Enterobacteriaceae. No 
significant differences could be identified in microbiota by NOD2 genotype, but
fecal butanoic acid was higher in Crohn's patients carrying NOD2 mutations.
Conclusions: In this well-controlled study of NOD2 genotype and fecal microbiota,
we identified no significant genotype-microbiota associations. This suggests that
the changes associated with NOD2 genotype might only be seen at the mucosal
level, or that environmental factors and prior inflammation are the predominant
determinant of the observed dysbiosis in gut microbiota.

Background: A low vitamin D status has been put forward as a potential risk
factor for the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study
investigated the association between prediagnostic circulating vitamin D
concentrations and dietary intakes of vitamin D, and the risk of Crohn's disease 
(CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).
Methods: Among 359,728 participants of the European Prospective Investigation
into Cancer and Nutrition cohort, individuals who developed CD or UC after
enrollment were identified. Each case was matched with2 controls by center,
gender, age, date of recruitment, and follow-up time. At cohort entry, blood
samples were collected and dietary vitamin D intakes were obtained from validated
food frequency questionnaires. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were measured
using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Conditional logistic
regression was performed to determine the odds of CD and UC.
Results: Seventy-two participants developed CD and 169 participants developed UC 
after a median follow-up of 4.7 and 4.1 years, respectively. Compared with the
lowest quartile, no associations with the 3 higher quartiles of vitamin D
concentrations were observed for CD (p trend = 0.34) or UC (p trend = 0.66).
Similarly, no associations were detected when serum vitamin D levels were
analyzed as a continuous variable. Dietary vitamin D intakes were not associated 
with CD (p trend = 0.39) or UC (p trend = 0.83).
Conclusions: Vitamin D status was not associated with the development of CD or
UC. This does not suggest a major role for vitamin D deficiency in the etiology
of IBD, although larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.

AIM: To establish the relationship of protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor
type 2 and 22 (PTPN2/22) polymorphisms and mycobacterial infections in Crohn's
disease (CD).
METHODS: All 133 subjects' blood samples were genotyped for nine single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PTPN2/22 using TaqMan™ genotyping, while the
effect of the SNPs on PTPN2/22 and IFN-γ gene expression was determined using
RT-PCR. Detection of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) IS900 
gene was done by nPCR after DNA extraction from the isolated leukocytes of each
subjects' blood samples. T-cells isolated from the patient samples were tested
for response to phytohematoagglutonin (PHA) mitogen or mycobacterial antigens by 
BrdU proliferation assays for T-cell activity.
RESULTS: Out of the nine SNPs examined, subjects with either heterozygous
(TC)/minor (CC) alleles in PTPN2:rs478582 occurred in 83% of CD subjects compared
to 61% healthy controls (P-values < 0.05; OR = 3.03). Subjects with either
heterozygous (GA)/minor (AA) alleles in PTPN22:rs2476601 occurred in 16% of CD
compared to 6% healthy controls (OR = 2.7). Gene expression in PTPN2/22 in CD
subjects was significantly decreased by 2 folds compared to healthy controls
(P-values < 0.05). IFN-γ expression levels were found to be significantly
increased by approxiately 2 folds in subjects when either heterozygous or minor
alleles in PTPN2:rs478582 and/or PTPN22:rs2476601 were found (P-values < 0.05).
MAP DNA was detected in 61% of CD compared to only 8% of healthy controls
(P-values < 0.05, OR = 17.52), where subjects with either heterozygous or minor
alleles in PTPN2:rs478582 and/or PTPN22:rs2476601 had more MAPbacteremia presence
than subjects without SNPs did. The average T-cell proliferation in CD treated
with PHA or mycobacteria antigens was, respectively, 1.3 folds and 1.5 folds
higher than healthy controls without any significant SNP.
CONCLUSION: The data suggests that SNPs in PTPN2/22 affect the negative
regulation of the immune response in CD patients, thus leading to an increase in 
inflammation/apoptosis and susceptibility of mycobacteria.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Individuals with monogenic disorders of phagocyte function
develop chronic colitis that resembles Crohn's disease (CD). We tested for
associations between mutations in genes encoding reduced nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases, neutrophil function, and phenotypes of
CD in pediatric patients.
METHODS: We performed whole-exome sequence analysis to identify mutations in
genes encoding NADPH oxidases (such as CYBA, CYBB, NCF1, NCF2, NCF4, RAC1, and
RAC2) using DNA from 543 pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.
Blood samples were collected from an additional 129 pediatric patients with CD
and 26 children without IBD (controls); we performed assays for neutrophil
activation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and bacteria uptake and
killing. Whole-exome sequence analysis was performed using DNA from 46 of the
children with CD to examine associations with NADPH gene mutations; RNA sequence 
analyses were performed using blood cells from 46 children with CD to test for
variations in neutrophil gene expression associated with ROS production.
RESULTS: We identified 26 missense mutations in CYBA, CYBB, NCF1, NCF2, and NCF4.
Patients with CD who carried mutations in these genes were 3-fold more likely to 
have perianal disease (P = .0008) and stricturing complications (P = .002) than
children with CD without these mutations. Among patients with CD with none of
these mutations, 9% had undergone abdominal surgery; among patients with
mutations in these NADPH oxidase genes, 31% had undergone abdominal surgery
(P = .0004). A higher proportion of neutrophils from children with CD had low ROS
production (47%) than from controls (15%) among the 129 patients tested for ROS
(P = .002). Minor alleles of the NADPH genes were detected in 7% of children with
CD whose neutrophils produced normal levels of ROS vs 38% of children whose
neutrophils produced low levels of ROS (P = .009). Neutrophils that produced low 
levels of ROS had specific alterations in genes that regulate glucose metabolism 
and antimicrobial responses.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified missense mutations in genes that encode NADPH oxidases
in children with CD; these were associated with a more aggressive disease course 
and reduced ROS production by neutrophils from the patients.

cepA, cfi, and nim. B. fragilis group was detected in 38% of IBD (UC: 36/89;
CD:1/11) and 25% (5/20) of non-IBD patients. While B. vulgatus (UC: 20/36, CD:
1/2, control: 1/6); B. fragilis (UC: 18/36, CD: 1/2, control: 5/6); B. ovatus
(UC: 2/36); B. caccae (UC: 1/36); and B. eggerthii (UC: 1/36) were characterized,
colonization of B. thetaiotamicron, B. merdae, B. distasonis, B. stercoris and
B. dorei species was not detected in these specimens. Co-existence of
B. fragilis + B. vulgatus (5 patients) and B. vulgatus + B. caccae (1 patient)
was detected just in UC patients. bft was detected among 31.5% (6/19) of
B. fragilis strains in the IBD and 40% (2/5) in the non-IBD groups. Nearly, 73.6%
of the strains from the patient group and 80% in control group harbored cepA;
31.5% and 20% in the patients and control groups harbored cfiA, and none of them 
harbored nim determinant. Co-occurrence of the cepA and cfiA was orderly detected
in 10.5% (2/19) and 20% (1/5) of the strains in these groups. The resistance
rates were detected as 95.8% (23/24 (to ampicillin (MIC range of ≤0.5-≥16 μg/ml),
0% to metronidazole and 29.1% to imipenem (7/24, MIC range ≤4-32 μg/ml). Nearly
25% (6/24) of the strains were resistant to ampicillin and imipenem,
simultaneously. No statistically significant difference was detected between the 
IBD and control groups for drug resistance phenotypes. Statistical analysis
showed significant associations between resistance to ampicillin or imipenem and 
carriage of cepA or cfiA, respectively (p value = 0.0007). PCR results on the
extracted plasmids confirmed their roles in carriage of cfiA and cepA. These data
provide guide for antibiotic therapy and highlights wide distribution of β-lactam
resistant B. fragilis strains in patients with IBD and non-IBD intestinal
disorders.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA molecules with regulatory functions on the
expression of genes through binding directly to target messenger RNA (mRNA)
transcripts, eventuating in gene expression suppression via translational
hindrance and/or target mRNA cleavage. These molecules have been established to
participate in numerous critical cellular settings, including differentiation,
development, and function of immune cells. As an important suppressor cell of
immune system, regulatory T cells (Tregs) are important in modulating the immune 
homeostasis as well as tolerance to self-antigens. Despite identification of
numerous transcription factors, cytokines, and other mediators regulate the
biology of Tregs, investigations have demonstrated that noncoding RNAs are
involved in several mechanisms of the regulation of Treg cells. On the other
side, dysregulation of expression of several miRNAs has been reported in Tregs,
implicating to the impaired function of these regulatory cells, resulting in
autoimmune and other immune-based disorders. In this review, we aim to go through
the overall microRNA network and specific miRNAs that are involved in the
development, differentiation, and function of Tregs. Moreover, an overview was
provided with respect to the role of aberrant expression of miRNAs in Tregs of
autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus,
rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, and psoriasis.

AIM: Crohn's disease (CD) patients are mostly diagnosed with the uncomplicated
inflammatory form of disease; however, the majority will progress to complicated 
stricturing or penetrating disease over time. It is important to identify
patients at risk for disease progression at an early stage. The aim of our study 
was to examine the role of 33 candidate CD genes as possible predictors of
disease progression and their influence on time to progression from an
inflammatory to a stricturing or penetrating phenotype.
METHODS: Patients with an inflammatory phenotype at diagnosis were followed for
10 years and 33 CD-associated polymorphisms were genotyped. To test for
association with CD, 449 healthy individuals were analyzed as the control group.
RESULTS: Ten years after diagnosis, 39.1% of patients had not progressed beyond
an inflammatory phenotype, but 60.9% had progressed to complicated disease, with 
average time to progression being 5.91 years. Association analyses of selected
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) confirmed associations with CD for 12
SNPs. Furthermore, seven loci were associated with disease progression, out of
which SNP rs4263839 in the gene TNFSF15 showed the strongest association with
disease progression and the frameshift mutation rs2066847 in the gene NOD2 showed
the strongest association with time to progression.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study identified specific genetic biomarkers as
useful predictors of both disease progression and speed of disease progression in
patients with CD.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a major source of cancer-related
mortality, accounting for 10% of all cancer-related deaths. DNA mismatch repair
mechanism (MMR) responsible for correcting errors generated during DNA
replication and its deficiency is associated with both hereditary and sporadic
CRC. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most common forms of genetic 
variation, and it has been shown that the SNPs in MMR genes may modify CRC risk.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to determine the relationship between gene
polymorphism Glu39Gly (c.116G>A) of the hMSH6 gene and the modulation of the risk
of sporadic colorectal cancer in the Polish population.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 128 patients with resectable colorectal
carcinoma as well as 189 sex-, age-, and ethnicity-matched control subjects
without cancer history were enrolled in this study. Patients with a family
history of CRC or inflammatory bowel diseases were excluded from this study. The 
DNA was isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes of enrolled patients, and gene
polymorphisms were analyzed by restriction fragment length
polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction (RFLP-PCR).
RESULTS: We observed that the genotype G/A variant of Glu39Gly (c.116G>A)
genotype is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer (OR 1.65; 95% 
CI: 1.01-2.69; p = 0.44). The presence of A allele was also significantly higher 
in patients with CRC (OR 1.57; 95% CI: 1.04-2.38; p = 0.032). When comparing the 
prevalence of genotypes with clinical staging, genotype G/A and A allele were
significantly less frequent in stage III-IV than in I (OR 0.3409; 95% CI:
0.124-0.939; p = 0.0375, and OR 0.4462; 95% CI: 0.201-0.991; p = 0.044,
respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that hMSH6 Glu39Gly polymorphism is
associated with the risk of developing colorectal cancer in the Polish
population, probably due to a defective mismatch repair system. The presence of
G/A genotype and A allele is, however, associated with less advanced disease.

IL-36 cytokines have recently emerged as mediators of inflammation in autoimmune 
conditions including psoriasis vulgaris (PsV) and generalized pustular psoriasis 
(GPP). This study used RNA-seq to profile the transcriptome of primary epidermal 
keratinocytes (KCs) treated with IL-1B, IL-36A, IL-36B, or IL-36G. We identified 
some early IL-1B-specific responses (8 h posttreatment), but nearly all late
IL-1B responses were replicated by IL-36 cytokines (24 h posttreatment). Type I
and II interferon genes exhibited time-dependent response patterns, with early
induction (8 h) followed by no response or repression (24 h). Altogether, we
identified 225 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with shared responses to all
4 cytokines at both time points (8 and 24 h). These involved upregulation of
ligands (IL1A, IL1B, and IL36G) and activating proteases (CTSS) but also
upregulation of inhibitors such as IL1RN and IL36RN. Shared IL-1B/IL-36 DEGs
overlapped significantly with genes altered in PsV and GPP skin lesions, as well 
as genes near GWAS loci linked to autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases (e.g.,
PsV, psoriatic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and primary biliary
cholangitis). Inactivation of MyD88 adapter protein using CRISPR/Cas9 completely 
abolished expression responses of such DEGs to IL-1B and IL-36G stimulation.
These results provide a global view of IL-1B and IL-36 expression responses in
epidermal KCs with fine-scale characterization of time-dependent and
cytokine-specific response patterns. Our findings support an important role for
IL-1B and IL-36 in autoimmune or autoinflammatory conditions and show that MyD88 
adaptor protein mediates shared IL-1B/IL-36 responses.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) increases the risk of colorectal cancer, known
as colitis-associated cancer (CAC). It is still unclear what driver mutations are
caused by chronic inflammation and lead to CAC development. To get insight into
this issue, we investigated somatic alterations in CAC. We performed exome
sequencing of 22 fresh CACs and targeted sequencing of 43 genes on 90 archive
specimens from Japanese CAC patients, of which 58 were ulcerative colitis (UC)
and 32 were Crohn's disease (CD). Consistently with the previous reports, TP53
was commonly mutated (66%) whereas APC, KRAS and SMAD4 were mutated less
frequently (16%, 11% and 11%, respectively). Mucinous CD-CACs in the anus, an
Asian-specific subtype of CD-CAC, had less somatic mutations in our target genes.
We also found that RNF43, a negative regulator of the Wnt signaling, was
somatically mutated in a significant fraction of CACs (10 of 90; 11%). Two lines 
of evidence indicated that somatic mutations of RNF43 were related to chronic
inflammation. First, somatic mutations of RNF43 were significantly associated
with longer duration of IBD. Second, clinico-pathological features suggested many
of the APC-mutated CACs were actually sporadic colorectal cancer whereas
RNF43-mutated CACs did not have this tendency. RNA-Seq analysis showed that
RNF43-mutated CACs had elevated expression of c-Myc and its target genes,
suggesting that RNF43 is a bona fide driver of CAC development. This study
provides evidence that somatic mutation of RNF43 is the driver genetic alteration
that links chronic inflammation and cancer development in about 10% of CACs.

AIM: The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) c.415C>T in exon 3 of NUDT15
affects thiopurine-induced leukopenia in Asian patients with Crohn's disease.
Meanwhile, three additional genetic variants of NUDT15 were reported in patients 
with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We evaluated the effects of these additional
genetic variants of NUDT15 in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
treated with thiopurines.
METHODS: Ninety-six Japanese patients with IBD were enrolled. Genotyping for the 
NUDT15 and TPMT genes was performed using Custom TaqMan SNP genotyping assays or 
Sanger sequencing. The changes in white blood cell (WBC) count, mean corpuscular 
volume (MCV), platelet count, hemoglobin, CRP, amylase, albumin, AST, ALT, and
ESR were evaluated.
RESULTS: Genetic variants of exon 1 and exon 3 of NUDT15 were identified in 24 of
96 patients (25.0%). C.52G > A and c.36_37insGGAGTC in exon 1 were found in three
patients each. All three patients with c.36_37insGGAGTC in exon 1 were
heterozygotes of p.Arg139Cys in exon 3. Eighteen patients had p.Arg139Cys in exon
3 alone. The WBC count gradually decreased after initiation of thiopurine
treatment in the mutated cases (n = 24), and was significantly lower at 6, 8, 10,
and 16 wk (P = 0.0271, 0.0037, 0.0051, and 0.0185, respectively). The WBC counts 
were also evaluated in patients with and without prednisolone treatment. In the
patients with prednisolone treatment, the WBC count tended to show a greater
decrease in the mutated cases, with significant differences at 8 and 10 wk (P =
0.012 and 0.029, respectively). In the patients without prednisolone treatment,
the WBC count was significantly lower at 2, 4, 8, and 14 wk in mutated cases (P =
0.0196, 0.0182, 0.0237 and 0.0241, respectively). MCV increased after starting
thiopurine treatment in the mutated cases, and was significantly higher at 10 wk 
(P = 0.0085). Platelet count, hemoglobin, CRP, amylase, albumin, AST, ALT and ESR
did not differ significantly between the wild-type and mutated cases. TPMT
mutations were not found in any of the patients.
CONCLUSION: Mutations in exon 1 of NUDT15 also affect thiopurine-induced
leukopenia in patients with IBD. To discuss thiopurine-induced leukopenia in more
detail, investigation of SNPs in both exon 1 and exon 3 of NUDT15 is needed.

Campylobacter concisus is an emerging pathogen associated with inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD), yet little is known about the genetic diversity of C. concisus in 
relation to host niches and disease. We isolated 104 C. concisus isolates from
saliva, mucosal biopsies and faecal samples from 41 individuals (26 IBD, 3
Gastroenteritis (GE), 12 Healthy controls (HC)). Whole genomes were sequenced and
the dataset pan-genome examined, and genomic information was used for typing
using multi-locus-sequence typing (MLST). C. concisus isolates clustered into two
main groups/genomospecies (GS) with 71 distinct sequence types (STs) represented.
Sampling site (p < 0.001), rather than disease phenotype (p = 1.00) was
associated with particular GS. We identified 97 candidate genes associated with
increase or decrease in prevalence during the anatomical descent from the oral
cavity to mucosal biopsies to faeces. Genes related to cell wall/membrane
biogenesis were more common in oral isolates, whereas genes involved in cell
transport, metabolism and secretory pathways were more prevalent in enteric
isolates. Furthermore, there was no correlation between individual genetic
diversity and clinical phenotype. This study confirms the genetic heterogeneity
of C. concisus and provides evidence that genomic variation is related to the
source of isolation, but not clinical phenotype.

BACKGROUND: Although the main treatments of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) aim 
at the induction and maintenance of clinical remission, several studies have
demonstrated inflammation still present in clinical remission. The goal of this
study was to analyze the gene expression profiles between the pediatric IBD and
control samples, aiming to further investigate the underlying therapeutic target 
in remission.
METHODS: Gene expression profiles data of GSE33943 were downloaded from Gene
Expression Omnibus, which included 45 pediatric IBD samples and 13 control
samples. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between IBD and control
samples were identified by LIMMA package in R and the function of DEGs were
predicted by Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses using GeneAnswer 
package. Furthermore, a protein‒protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed
through the STRING database and functional module was obtained using ClusterONE.
RESULTS: A total of 224 DEGs were screened between IBD and control samples. These
DEGs (e.g. up-regulated FAS and down-regulated CCL5) were mainly enriched in
cytokine‒cytokine receptor interaction and chemokine signaling pathway. In
addition, some hub genes (e.g. up-regulated PSMA2 and PSMA6) were obtained
through PPI network and functional module. These two genes were involved in
Proteasome alpha-subunit and conserved site by functional module analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: The immune and Proteasome mechanisms are still active during
remission and FAS, PMSF6 and PMSF2 may be underlying targets for therapy of this 
disease.

Previous studies have identified relevant genes and signalling pathways that are 
hampered in human disorders as potential candidates for therapeutics. Developing 
nucleic acid-based tools to manipulate gene expression, such as short interfering
RNAs1-3 (siRNAs), opens up opportunities for personalized medicine. Yet, although
major progress has been made in developing siRNA targeted delivery carriers,
mainly by utilizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for targeting4-8, their clinical
translation has not occurred. This is in part because of the massive development 
and production requirements and the high batch-to-batch variability of current
technologies, which rely on chemical conjugation. Here we present a
self-assembled modular platform that enables the construction of a theoretically 
unlimited repertoire of siRNA targeted carriers. The self-assembly of the
platform is based on a membrane-anchored lipoprotein that is incorporated into
siRNA-loaded lipid nanoparticles that interact with the antibody crystallizable
fragment (Fc) domain. We show that a simple switch of eight different mAbs
redirects the specific uptake of siRNAs by diverse leukocyte subsets in vivo. The
therapeutic potential of the platform is demonstrated in an inflammatory bowel
disease model by targeting colon macrophages to reduce inflammatory symptoms, and
in a Mantle Cell Lymphoma xenograft model by targeting cancer cells to induce
cell death and improve survival. This modular delivery platform represents a
milestone in the development of precision medicine.

BACKGROUND: The skin harbors complex communities of resident microorganisms, yet 
little is known of their physiological roles and the molecular mechanisms that
mediate cutaneous host-microbe interactions. Here, we profiled skin
transcriptomes of mice reared in the presence and absence of microbiota to
elucidate the range of pathways and functions modulated in the skin by the
microbiota.
RESULTS: A total of 2820 genes were differentially regulated in response to
microbial colonization and were enriched in gene ontology (GO) terms related to
the host-immune response and epidermal differentiation. Innate immune response
genes and genes involved in cytokine activity were generally upregulated in
response to microbiota and included genes encoding toll-like receptors,
antimicrobial peptides, the complement cascade, and genes involved in IL-1 family
cytokine signaling and homing of T cells. Our results also reveal a role for the 
microbiota in modulating epidermal differentiation and development, with
differential expression of genes in the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC). 
Genes with correlated co-expression patterns were enriched in binding sites for
the transcription factors Klf4, AP-1, and SP-1, all implicated as regulators of
epidermal differentiation. Finally, we identified transcriptional signatures of
microbial regulation common to both the skin and the gastrointestinal tract.
CONCLUSIONS: With this foundational approach, we establish a critical resource
for understanding the genome-wide implications of microbially mediated gene
expression in the skin and emphasize prospective ways in which the microbiome
contributes to skin health and disease.

BACKGROUND: While monoclonal antibodies against tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα)
are effective in treating Crohn's disease (CD), approximately one-third of
patients lose response. The mechanisms underlying this loss of response remain
elusive.
AIM: We sought to determine if novel biological pathways, including
TNFα-independent inflammatory pathways, emerge in those with loss of response to 
anti-TNFα.
METHODS: Using RNA microarray technology in 28 patients with CD, we examined the 
colonic gene expression differences between those with active inflammation in the
setting of loss of response to TNFα-antagonist therapy ("loss of responders")
compared to anti-TNFα naïve patients with active inflammation and those on
anti-TNF therapy in disease remission. Pathway enrichment analyses were
performed.
RESULTS: We found that colonic expression of chemokines known to drive
inflammation (CXCL20, CXCL9, and CXCL10) was elevated in those with loss of
response compared to those in remission. Expression of genes critical to
modulating oxidative stress burden (DUOX2, DUOXA2, and NOS2) was also elevated.
Additionally, MMP3, MMP1, and MMP12 were elevated in those with continued
inflammation. Gene enrichment analysis revealed that loss of responders exhibited
dysregulation in the cysteine and methionine metabolism pathway, suggesting
alteration in oxidative stress burden. There were no differences in genes or
pathways between loss of responders and those who were TNFα-naïve. However, loss 
of response occurred despite the ability of anti-TNFα therapy to normalize APO
gene expression.
CONCLUSION: Our analyses suggest that loss of response to anti-TNFα is not driven
by the emergence of pathways that bypass the action or induce resistance to
anti-TNFα therapy.

Colonic macrophages induce pathogenic inflammation against commensal bacteria,
leading to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although the ontogeny of colonic
macrophages has been well studied in the past decade, how macrophages gain
colitogenic properties during the development of colitis is unknown. Using a
chemically induced colitis model, we showed that accumulated Ly6C+ cells
consisting of inflammatory monocytes and inflammatory macrophages strongly
expressed representative colitogenic mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-α
(TNF-α) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). The interferon-γ-signal
transducer and activator of transcription 1 (IFN-γ-Stat1) pathway was required
for generating colitogenic macrophages, given that Stat1-/- mice had less severe 
colitis and fewer colitogenic macrophages. Notably, IFN-γ induced histone
acetylation at the promoter regions of the Tnf and Nos2 loci in the monocyte and 
macrophage lineage, indicating that IFN-γ-dependent epigenetic regulation
instructs the development of the colitogenic monocyte and macrophage lineage in
vivo. Collectively, our results provide the essential mechanism by which
dysregulated colitogenic monocytes/macrophages develop at the colon mucosa during
inflammation, and suggest a new drug target for treating IBD.

Crohn's disease (CD) represents a chronic inflammatory disorder of the intestinal
tract. Several susceptibility genes have been linked to CD, though their precise 
role in the pathogenesis of this disorder remains unclear. Immunity-related
GTPase M (IRGM) is an established risk allele in CD. We have shown previously
that conventionally raised (CV) mice lacking the IRGM ortholog, Irgm1 exhibit
abnormal Paneth cells (PCs) and increased susceptibility to intestinal injury. In
the present study, we sought to utilize this model system to determine if
environmental conditions impact these phenotypes, as is thought to be the case in
human CD. To accomplish this, wild-type and Irgm1-/- mice were rederived into
specific pathogen-free (SPF) and germ-free (GF) conditions. We next assessed how 
these differential housing environments influenced intestinal injury patterns,
and epithelial cell morphology and function in wild-type and Irgm1-/- mice.
Remarkably, in contrast to CV mice, SPF Irgm1-/- mice showed only a slight
increase in susceptibility to dextran sodium sulfate-induced inflammation. SPF
Irgm1-/- mice also displayed minimal abnormalities in PC number and morphology,
and in antimicrobial peptide expression. Goblet cell numbers and epithelial
proliferation were also unaffected by Irgm1 in SPF conditions. No microbial
differences were observed between wild-type and Irgm1-/- mice, but gut bacterial 
communities differed profoundly between CV and SPF mice. Specifically,
Helicobacter sequences were significantly increased in CV mice; however,
inoculating SPF Irgm1-/- mice with Helicobacter hepaticus was not sufficient to
transmit a pro-inflammatory phenotype. In summary, our findings suggest the
impact of Irgm1-deficiency on susceptibility to intestinal inflammation and
epithelial function is critically dependent on environmental influences. This
work establishes the importance of Irgm1-/- mice as a model to elucidate
host-environment interactions that regulate mucosal homeostasis and intestinal
inflammatory responses. Defining such interactions will be essential for
developing novel preventative and therapeutic strategies for human CD.

Background and Aims: Crohn's disease [CD] is a chronic inflammatory disease with 
unpredictable behaviour. More than half of CD patients eventually develop
complications such as stenosis, for which they then require endoscopic dilatation
or surgery, as no anti-fibrotic drugs are currently available. We aim to identify
disease-modifying genes associated with fibrostenotic CD.
Methods: We performed a within-case analysis comparing 'extreme phenotypes' using
the Immunochip and replication of the top single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs] 
with Agena Bioscience in two independent case-control cohorts totalling 322 cases
with fibrostenotis [recurrent after surgery] and 619 cases with purely
inflammatory CD.
Results: Combined meta-analysis resulted in a genome-wide significant signal for 
SNP rs11861007 [p = 6.0910-11], located on chromosome 16, in lncRNA
RP11-679B19.1, an lncRNA of unknown function, and close to exon 9 of the WWOX
gene, which codes for WW domain-containing oxidoreductase. We analysed mRNA
expression of TGF-β and downstream genes in ileocecal resection material from ten
patients with and without the WWOX risk allele. Patients carrying the risk allele
[A] showed enhanced colonic expression of TGF-β compared to patients homozygous
for the wild-type [G] allele [p = 0.0079].
Conclusion: We have identified a variant in WWOX and in lncRNA RP11-679B19.1 as a
disease-modifying genetic variant associated with recurrent fibrostenotic CD and 
replicated this association in an independent cohort. WWOX can potentially play a
crucial role in fibrostenosis in CD, being positioned at the crossroads of
inflammation and fibrosis.

Background: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) are key regulators of gene transcription
and many show tissue-specific expression. We previously defined a novel
inflammatory and metabolic ileal gene signature in treatment-naive pediatric
Crohn disease (CD). We now extend our analyses to include potential regulatory
lncRNA.
Methods: Using RNAseq, we systematically profiled lncRNAs and protein-coding gene
expression in 177 ileal biopsies. Co-expression analysis was used to identify
functions and tissue-specific expression. RNA in situ hybridization was used to
validate expression. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to test lncRNA 
regulation by IL-1β in Caco-2 enterocytes.
Results: We characterize widespread dysregulation of 459 lncRNAs in the ileum of 
CD patients. Using only the lncRNA in discovery and independent validation
cohorts showed patient classification as accurate as the protein-coding genes,
linking lncRNA to CD pathogenesis. Co-expression and functional annotation
enrichment analyses across several tissues and cell types 1showed that the
upregulated LINC01272 is associated with a myeloid pro-inflammatory signature,
whereas the downregulated HNF4A-AS1 exhibits association with an epithelial
metabolic signature. We confirmed tissue-specific expression in biopsies using in
situ hybridization, and validated regulation of prioritized lncRNA upon IL-1β
exposure in differentiated Caco-2 cells. Finally, we identified significant
correlations between LINC01272 and HNF4A-AS1 expression and more severe mucosal
injury.
Conclusions: We systematically define differentially expressed lncRNA in the
ileum of newly diagnosed pediatric CD. We show lncRNA utility to correctly
classify disease or healthy states and demonstrate their regulation in response
to an inflammatory signal. These lncRNAs, after mechanistic exploration, may
serve as potential new tissue-specific targets for RNA-based interventions.

Inflammation plays pivotal roles in different stages of tumor development.
Screening for predisposing genetic abnormalities and understanding the roles
these genes play in the crosstalk between immune and cancer cells will provide
new targets for cancer therapy and prevention. The interferon inducible
transmembrane (IFITM) genes are involved in pathogenesis of the gastro-intestinal
tract. We aimed at delineating the role of IFITM3 in colonic epithelial
homeostasis, inflammation and colitis-associated tumorigenesis using
IFITM3-deficient mice. Chemical induction of colitis in IFITM3-deficient mice
results in significantly increased clinical signs of inflammation and induction
of invasive tumorigenesis. Bone marrow transplantation showed that cells of the
hematopoietic system are responsible for colitis deterioration. In these mice,
impaired cytokine expression skewed inflammatory response toward pathogenic Th17 
with reduced expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 during the
recovery phase. Intriguingly, mice lacking the entire IFITM locus developed
spontaneous chronic colitis from the age of 14 weeks. Sequencing the 16S rRNA of 
naïve mice lacking IFITM3 gene, or the entire locus containing five IFITM genes, 
revealed these mice had significant bacterial differences from their wild-type
littermates. Our novel results provide strong evidence for the essential role of 
IFITM genes in ameliorating colitis and colitis-associated tumorigenesis.

[Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis - current view on genetic determination,
immunopathogenesis and biologic therapy].

[Article in Czech]

Buc M.

Crohns disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic inflammatory
disorders of the intestine, also called inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which 
are not caused by pathogenic microorganisms but result from non-specific
inflammatory processes in the bowel. IBD are polygenic diseases, as evidenced by 
the genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which have discovered more than 200
genes or genetic regions to be associated with IBD. Some of them are specific for
CD or UC; however, there are 110 overlapping genes. In the pathogenesis of CD,
activation of adaptive immunity mediated by TH1, TH17, or TH1/TH17 cells is
induced because of disturbances in the mechanisms of innate immunity and
autophagocytosis. By comparison, the major events that trigger autoimmune
processes in UC are an increased translocation of commensal bacteria into the
submucosa because of loose inter-epithelial connections with subsequent
activation of ILC2, TH9, TH2, and NKT cells. Knowledge of the pathogenesis of a
disease enables an effective therapy, which is especially true for biological
therapy. It is noteworthy that monoclonal antibodies directed against the major
protagonists underlying both CD and UC have failed. It points to the complexity
of immunopathologic processes that run in both diseases. One can suppose that a
blockade of one inflammatory pathway is circumvented by an alternative pathway.
TNF is the principal pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays a major role in CD and 
UC as well. It was therefore decided to treat IBD patients with anti-TNF
monoclonal antibodies, infliximab or adalimumab. Approximately one half of the CD
patients and one third of the UC patients respond to this treatment.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a relapsing and remitting inflammatory disease of the 
colon, with an increasing incidence worldwide. 6-Gingerol (6G) is a bioactive
constituent of Zingiber officinale, which has been reported to possess various
biological activities. This study was designed to evaluate the role of 6G in
chronic UC. Chronic UC was induced in mice by three cycles of 2.5% dextran
sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water. Each cycle consisted of 7 days of 2.5%
DSS followed by 14 days of normal drinking water. 6G (100 mg/kg) and a reference 
anti-colitis drug sulfasalazine (SZ) (100 mg/kg) were orally administered daily
to the mice throughout exposure to three cycles of 2.5% DSS. Administration of 6G
and SZ significantly prevented disease activity index and aberrant crypt foci
formation in DSS-treated mice. Furthermore, 6G and SZ suppresses immunoexpression
of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1β, inducible nitric oxide synthase, 
Regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), and
Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in the DSS-treated mice. 6G
effectively protected against colonic oxidative damage by augmenting the
antioxidant status with marked decrease in lipid peroxidation levels in
DSS-treated mice. Moreover, 6G significantly inhibited nuclear factor kappa B
(P65), p38, cyclooxygenase-2, and β-catenin whereas it enhanced IL-10 and
adenomatous polyposis coli expression in DSS-treated mice. In conclusion, 6G
prevented DSS-induced chronic UC via anti-inflammatory and antioxidative
mechanisms and preservation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.

Glycosylation, a type of post-translational modification, is involved in the
development of a wide range of diseases, including IBD, by modulating the
function of various glycoproteins. To identify novel genes contributing to the
development of IBD, we analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of
glycosylation-related genes in IBD patients and identified MAN2A1, encoding
alpha-mannosidase II (α-MII), as a candidate gene. α-MII plays a crucial, but not
exclusive, role in the maturation of N-glycans. We also observed that intestinal 
epithelial cells (IECs), which establish the first-line barrier and regulate gut 
immunity, selectively expressed α-MII with minimal expression of its isozyme,
alpha-mannosidase IIx (α-MIIx). This led us to hypothesize that IEC-intrinsic
α-MII is implicated in the pathogenesis of IBD. To test this hypothesis, we
generated IEC-specific α-MII-deficient (α-MIIΔIEC) mice. Although α-MII
deficiency has been shown to have a minimal effect on N-glycan maturation in most
cell types due to the compensation by α-MIIx, ablation of α-MII impaired the
maturation of N-glycans in IECs. α-MIIΔIEC mice were less susceptible to dextran 
sulfate sodium-induced colitis compared with control littermates. In accordance
with this, neutrophil infiltration in the colonic mucosa was attenuated in
α-MIIΔIEC mice. Furthermore, gene expression levels of neutrophil-attracting
chemokines were downregulated in the colonic tissue. These results suggest that
IEC-intrinsic α-MII promotes intestinal inflammation by facilitating chemokine
expression. We propose SNPs in MAN2A1 as a novel genetic factor for IBD.Key
words: inflammatory bowel disease, alpha-mannosidase II, intestinal epithelial

Objective: To explore the relationship of Crohn's disease (CD) susceptibility to 
aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) polymorphisms and haplotypes in Han population in
Wenzhou city, China. Methods: A total of 310 CD patients and 573 age- and
sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled in our study. Three single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) of AhR(rs10249788,rs2158041,rs2066853) were determined by
the improved multiple ligase detection reaction technique. Unconditional logistic
regression analyses was applied to analyze the allelic and genotypic differences 
of each SNP between CD patients and controls, as well as their influence on the
clinicopathologic characteristics in CD patients. Analyses of linkage
disequilibrium and haplotype were performed by Haploview 4.2 software in all
study subjects. Results: Compared with the controls, the variant allele (T) and
genotype (CT+TT) of (rs2158041) were evidently decreased among CD patients
(19.52% vs. 25.04%, P=0.009; 34.19% vs. 44.68%, P=0.003). According to "the
Montreal Classification Standards" , CD patients were divided into different
subgroups. The variant allele (T) and genotype (CT+TT) of (rs2158041) were
significantly lower in patients with terminal ileum CD than in controls (16.79%
vs. 25.04%, P=0.005; 28.24% vs. 44.68%, P=0.001). Similar conclusions were also
drawn in patients with constricting disease when compared with the controls
(15.20% vs. 25.04%, P=0.003; 28.43% vs. 44.68%, P=0.003). The three SNPs above
were shown to be in a linkage disequilibrium. Compared with the controls
respectively, the frequency of haplotype (CCG) was increased in CD patients
(44.73% vs. 39.60%, P=0.039), whereas that of haplotype (CTG) was decreased
(18.02% vs. 22.78%, P=0.047). Conclusions: AhR (rs2158041) variation might
influence the risk as well as the location and behavior of CD. The haplotype
(CCG) possibly increase the risk of CD development, whereas haplotype (CTG) might
decrease it.

Chronic Inflammatory Diseases and Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease:
Innocent Bystanders or Partners in Crime?

Inflammation plays a significant role in atherosclerosis and cardiovascular
disease (CVD). Patients with chronic inflammatory diseases are at increased risk 
of CVD, but it is debated whether this association is causal or dependent on
shared risk factors, other exposures, genes, and/or inflammatory pathways. The
current review summarizes epidemiological, clinical, and experimental data
supporting the role of shared inflammatory mechanisms between atherosclerotic CVD
and rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, and
periodontitis, respectively, and provides insights to future prospects in this
area of research. Awareness of the role of inflammation in CVD in patients with
chronic inflammatory diseases and the potential for anti-inflammatory therapy,
e.g., with tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors, to also reduce atherosclerotic CVD
has evolved into guideline- based recommendations. These include regular CVD risk
assessment, aggressive treatment of traditional CVD risk factors, and recognition
of reduced CVD as an added benefit of strict inflammatory disease control. At
present, chronic inflammatory diseases would appear to qualify as partners in
crime and not merely innocent bystanders to CVD. However, definite incremental
contributions of inflammation versus effects of the complex interplay with other 
CVD risk factors may never be fully elucidated and for the foreseeable future,
inflammation is posed to maintain its current position as both a marker and a
maker of CVD, with clinical utility both for identification of patient at risk of
CVD and as target for therapy to reduce CVD.

Purpose: The main aim of this study was investigate the association between the
genetic polymorphism of antioxidant enzyme genes: SOD1, CAT and GSHPX1 and the
risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and
ulcerative colitis in the Polish population.
Methods: A total of 445 subjects including 200 patients with IBD and 245 controls
were allowed in this study. We determined activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD),
catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx1) and examination their association
with the SNPs of respective genes (SOD1 +35A/C, CAT C-262T and GSHPX1 Pro197Leu).
RFLP technique was used to determine the selected genes polymorphisms.
Antioxidant enzymes activity were evaluated in erythrocyte hemolysate of 23
patients with non-active IBD and 30 healthy participants.
Results: The A/C genotype and the C allele frequencies of A/C polymorphism of
SOD1 gene were significantly associated with the reduced risk of IBD (OR=0.43;
95% CI 0.23; 0.83). Alike, C/T (OR=0.45; 95% CI= 0.29; 0.70) and T/T genotype
(OR=0.43; 95% CI= 0.21; 0.87) of GSHPX1 gene polymorphism diminished the
susceptibility to IBD. A significant decrease of CAT (P=0.028) and increase of
GPx1 (P=0.025) enzyme activities were seen in IBD patients compared to control.
Conclusions: Our data confirm dysregulated antioxidant capacity in patients
suffering from IBD. Both, the SOD1 A/C genotype as well as GSHPX1 C/T and T/T
genotypes may be associated with a reduction risk of IBD in the Polish
population.

Monogenic defects in genes related to primary immunodeficiencies can be
responsible for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Mutations in the X-linked
inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) gene have been described in several patients
suffering from IBD and, in particular, with very early-onset inflammatory bowel
disease (VEOIBD) features. We report a VEOIBD child with a novel XIAP gene
mutation characterized by a complicated disease course, which is unresponsive to 
several medical treatment options. A next-generation sequencing was performed and
revealed a de novo hemizygous mutation in XIAP gene: c.565T>C p.L189P. After
mutation discovery, we investigated the XIAP protein expression and
nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain protein 2 (NOD2) signaling by western
blotting. Flow-cytometry was used to analyze intracellular protein expression in 
different cell subsets and T cell apoptosis. We observed reduced protein
expression in lymphocytes, granulocytes, monocytes, an Epstein-Barr
virus-immortalized B cell line as well as increased apoptosis, and impairment in 
NOD2 signaling. The child was successfully treated with HLA-haploidentical
hemapoietic stem cells transplant, acquired from his mother, after ex vivo
elimination of α/β T cells and CD19 B cells. One year after the transplant, we
repeated the analysis to appreciate the changes in his impairments. The recovery 
of XIAP protein expression, function, and normalization of apoptosis were
observed. Our report emphasizes the important role of genetic analysis in the
diagnosis of VEOIBD, illustrates the complete immunological and gastrointestinal 
recovery after transplant, and shows one of the few successful transplant cases
of XIAP patients.

AIM: To investigate whether common variants in the oxidative pathway genes
influence inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) risk among Moroccan patients.
METHODS: The distribution of (TAAA)n_rs12720460 and (CCTTT)n _rs3833912 NOS2A
microsatellite repeats, HIF-1A_rs11549467 and NFKB1-94ins/delATTG_rs28362491 was 
analyzed in 507 subjects grouped in 199 IBD and 308 healthy controls. Genotyping 
was performed with polymerase chain reaction-fluorescent method and the TaqMan®
allelic discrimination technology.
RESULTS: The allele and genotype frequencies of HIF1A_ rs11549467,
NFKB1_rs28362491 and NOS2A_ (TAAA)n did not differ significantly between patients
and controls. Analysis of NOS2A_ (CCTTT)n markers evidenced differences between
patients and healthy controls. A preferential presence of the (CCTTT)8 (P = 0.02;
OR = 1.71, 95%CI: 1.07-2.74), (CCTTT)14 (P = 0.02; OR = 1.71, 95%CI: 1.06-2.76)
alleles in IBD, (CCTTT)8 (P = 0.008; OR = 1.95, 95%CI: 1.17-3.23) in CD and
(CCTTT)7 (P = 0.009; OR = 7.61, 95%CI: 1.25-46.08), (CCTTT)11 (P = 0.05; OR =
0.51, 95%CI: 0.25-1.01), (CCTTT)14 (P = 0.02; OR = 2.05, 95%CI: 1.07-3.94),
(CCTTT)15 (P = 0.01; OR = 2.25, 95%CI: 1.16-4.35) repeats in UC patients
indicated its possible association with higher disease risk which need to be
confirmed in a larger sample size.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the NOS2A_ (CCTTT)n gene variations may
influence IBD susceptibility in the Moroccan population.

Recent advancements suggest that in addition to its roles in developmental
processes, transcription repressor hairy and enhancer of split 1 (Hes1) also acts
as a key regulator of inflammatory responses. A healthy gut microbiota ecology is
critical for establishment of tissue homeostasis. However, the role of epithelial
Hes1 in regulating intestinal microbiota ecology and intestinal homeostasis
remains unexplored. Here we show that epithelial Hes1 deficiency leads to
intestinal microbial dysbiosis and disturbed homeostasis. Both inducible Hes1
deletion and intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-intrinsic Hes1 deletion resulted in
loss of Bacteroidetes in ileum and increase of Escherichia coli and Akkermansia
muciniphila in colon. Loss of Bacteroidetes closely correlated with decreased
expression of commensal-dependent antimicrobial genes, leading to impaired
resistance against pathogenic bacterial colonization. Moreover, Hes1 deficiency
enhanced susceptibility to Dextran sodium sulphate-induced intestinal
inflammation. Of note, transfer of Hes1-deficient-mouse-derived fecal microbiota 
promoted intestinal inflammation. The increase of A. muciniphila in colon was
associated with Hes1-deficiency-induced unbalanced mucosal microhabitats. Thus,
our results support that IEC-intrinsic Hes1 maintains gut homeostasis by
preventing microbial dysbiosis partially through regulating mucosal
microhabitats.

OBJECTIVE: Most patients with Crohn's disease (CD) are diagnosed with the
uncomplicated inflammatory form of the disease (Montreal stage B1). However, the 
majority of them will progress to complicated stricturing (B2) and penetrating
(B3) CD during their lifetimes. The aim of our study was to identify the genetic 
factors associated with time to progression from uncomplicated to complicated CD.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with an inflammatory phenotype at diagnosis were
followed up for 10 years. Genotyping was carried out using Illumina ImmunoChip.
After quality control, association analyses, Bonferroni's adjustments, linear and
Cox's regression, and Kaplan-Meier analysis were carried out for 111 patients and
Manhattan plots were constructed.
RESULTS: Ten years after diagnosis, 39.1% of the patients still had the
inflammatory form and 60.9% progressed to complicated disease, with an average
time to progression of 5.91 years. Ileal and ileocolonic locations were
associated with the complicated CD (P=1.08E-03). We found that patients with the 
AA genotype at single-nucleotide polymorphism rs16857259 near the gene CACNA1E
progressed to the complicated form later (8.80 years) compared with patients with
the AC (5.11 years) or CC (2.00 years) genotypes (P=3.82E-07). In addition, nine 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (near the genes RASGRP1, SULF2, XPO1, ZBTB44, HLA
DOA/BRD2, HLA DRB1/HLA DQA1, PPARA, PUDP, and KIAA1614) showed a suggestive
association with disease progression (P<10). Multivariate Cox's regression
analysis on the basis of clinical and genetic data confirmed the association of
the selected model with disease progression (P=5.73E-16).
CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed the association between the locus on chromosome 1
near the gene CACNA1E with time to progression from inflammatory to stricturing
or penetrating CD. Predicting the time to progression is useful to the clinician 
in terms of individualizing patients' management.

Individuals with inflammatory bowel disease are at high risk of developing
colitis-associated cancer (CAC). Strategies to block the process from
inflammatory bowel disease to CAC should be considered. In the experiment, we aim
to explore the chemopreventive efficacy of the probiotic cocktail Bifico and its 
potential mechanism in azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulphate-induced CAC in
mice. Oral pretreatment of Bifico was adopted to evaluate its protective effect. 
The colorectums of 35 C57BL/6 mice were collected and examined for the degree of 
inflammation and tumorigenesis. Comparative 16S rRNA sequencing was carried out
to observe Bifico-target alterations in gene expression and microbiota structure.
We found that pretreatment of Bifico alleviated intestinal inflammation and
reduced tumor formation. Furthermore, we identified a subset of genes as
potential targets of Bifico treatment, including CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, and CXCL5, 
which are all ligands of C-X-C motif receptor 2 (CXCR2). The 16S rRNA sequencing 
showed that Bifico decreased the abundance of genera Desulfovibrio,
Mucispirillum, and Odoribacter, and a bloom of genus Lactobacillus was detected. 
Notably, we found that an abundance of these Bifico-target taxa was significantly
associated with the expression of CXCR2 ligand genes. Our studies indicate that
Bifico, given orally, can ameliorate CAC in mice through intervening with the
possible link between Desulfovibrio, Mucispirillum, Odoribacter, Lactobacillus,
and CXCR2 signaling.

Background & Aims: Upon intestinal epithelial damage a complex wound healing
response is initiated to restore epithelial integrity and defend against
pathogenic invasion. Epithelium-derived Indian Hedgehog (Ihh) functions as a
critical sensor in this process. Signaling occurs in a paracrine manner because
the receptor for Ihh is expressed only in the mesenchyme, but the exact Hedgehog 
target cell has remained elusive. The aim of this study was to elucidate further 
the nature of this target cell in the context of intestinal inflammation.
Methods: Hedgehog activity was modulated genetically in both cell type-specific
and body-wide models and the resulting animals were analyzed for gene expression 
profiles and sensitivity for dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) colitis. To
characterize the Hedgehog target cell, Gli1-CreERT2-Rosa26-ZsGreen animals were
generated, which express ZsGreen in all Hedgehog-responsive cells. These cells
were characterized using flow cytometry and immunofluorescence.
Results: Loss of Indian Hedgehog from the intestinal epithelium resulted in a
rapid increase in expression of inflammation-related genes, accompanied by
increased influx of immune cells. Animals with epithelium-specific deletion of
Ihh or lacking the Hedgehog receptor Smoothened from Hedgehog target cells were
more sensitive to DSS colitis. In contrast, specific deletion of Smoothened in
the myeloid compartment did not alter the response to DSS. This suggests that
Hedgehog signaling does not repress intestinal immunity through an effect on
myeloid cells. Indeed, we found that Hedgehog-responsive cells expressed gp38,
smooth muscle actin, and desmin, indicating a fibroblastic nature. Ihh signaling 
inhibited expression of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) in fibroblasts
in vitro and in vivo, thereby impairing the recruitment of immune cells.
Conclusions: We show that epithelium-derived Indian Hedgehog signals exclusively 
to fibroblasts in the intestine. Loss of Ihh leads to a rapid immune response
with up-regulation of fibroblast-derived CXCL12, and migration of immune cells
into the lamina propria.

Chromogranin-A (CHGA) is elevated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but little
is known about its role in colonic inflammation. IBD is associated with impaired 
functions of macrophages and increased apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells. 
We investigated CHGA expression in human subjects with active ulcerative colitis 
(UC) and the underlying mechanisms in Chga -/- mice. In UC, CHGA, classically
activated macrophage (M1) markers, caspase-3, p53, and its associated genes were 
increased, while alternatively activated macrophage (M2) markers were decreased
without changes in the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. CHGA correlated positively
with M1 and the apoptotic pathway and negatively with M2. In the murine dextran
sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, Chga deletion reduced the disease severity 
and onset, pro-inflammatory mediators, M1, and p53/caspase-3 activation, while it
upregulated anti-inflammatory cytokines and M2 markers with no changes in the
extrinsic apoptotic markers. Compared to Chga +/+ , M1 and p53/caspase-3
activation in Chga -/- macrophages were decreased in vitro, while M2 markers were
increased. CHGA plays a critical role during colitis through the modulation of
macrophage functions via the caspase-3/p53 pathway. Strategies targeting CHGA to 
regulate macrophage activation and apoptosis might be developed to treat UC
patients.KEY MESSAGES: • Chromogranin-A (CHGA) is pro-hormone and is secreted in 
the gut. CHGA is elevated in colitis and is associated with the disease severity.
The lack of GHGA has beneficial immunomodulatory properties during the
development of intestinal inflammation. The lack of CHGA regulates the plasticity
of macrophages and p53/caspase activation in colitis. Functional analysis of CHGA
may lead to a novel therapy for IBD.

The present study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms, including
potential genes, pathways and interactions, underlying the effect of intestinal
flora on intestinal health. The gene expression profiles of GSE22648 were
downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database to screen differentially
expressed genes (DEGs). The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated
Discovery was used for Gene Ontology (GO) functional and pathway enrichment
analysis of the DEGs. DEG‑associated literature was mined using the GenCLip 2.0
online tool. Finally, GO and pathway enrichment analyses of the DEGs in the
literature were processed. By comparing microbiota‑depleted mouse samples and
control mouse samples, a total of 115 DEGs, including 58 upregulated genes and 57
downregulated genes, were screened. The upregulated genes were enriched into
various GO terms, including microsome, oxidation reduction and heme binding,
whereas the 57 downregulated DEGs were enriched in different functions, including
DNA packaging and linoleic acid metabolism. A total of 19 genes, including
baculoviral IAP repeat containing 5, aurora kinase A, angiotensin I converting
enzyme 2 and free fatty acid receptor 2 were identified and enriched in four
modules, including cell division, chromosome segregation, inflammatory bowel
disease and inflammatory response. AURKA, inner centromere protein antigens
135/155 kDa, baculoviral IAP repeat containing 5, aurora kinase B and solute
carrier family 22 (organic cation/zwitterion transporter) member 4 were
identified as potential important genes for intestinal flora and intestinal
disease treatment through their involvement in various functions, including cell 
division, chromosome segregation, inflammatory bowel disease and inflammatory
response.

Molecular clonality analysis of T-cell receptor (TCR) genes for diagnosing T-cell
lymphoma is widely used in veterinary medicine. However, differentiating chronic 
enteritis (CE) from intestinal lymphoma is challenging because of the
incompatibility between histopathologic and clonality analysis results. On the
basis of findings that canine intestinal T-cell lymphoma and celiac disease share
some common features, we conducted serologic examinations in combination with
histopathologic and T-cell receptor clonality analyses in 48 dogs diagnosed with 
either CE or intestinal lymphoma. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G
(IgG) antibodies against gliadin and tissue transglutaminase (tTG) were
quantitatively measured using ELISA. The conditions were classified according to 
the histopathologic diagnosis, clonality analysis, and combined
histopathologic/clonality analysis. Histopathologic analysis showed that dogs
with intestinal lymphoma were likely to have high levels of serum IgA antibodies 
against gliadin and tTG, and serum IgG antibodies against tTG. No correlation
between the diagnosed groups and control group was observed in the results of the
clonality analysis and histopathologic/clonality analysis. It is interesting that
dogs with intestinal lymphoma had a higher serum IgA titer against gliadin and
tTG than did dogs with CE. These results suggest an association between
repetitive inflammatory stimulation by gliadin peptides and subsequent intestinal
lymphoma in dogs.

Inflammatory Bowel disease (IBD) is a widespread pathological condition with
clinical heterogeneity and with different levels of severity. Although IBD
usually occurs in young adults, onset in childhood and infancy are described in
patients within the 10th and second year of age. By genome-wide association
studies and meta-analysis, several genetic loci have been identified associated
with an increased risk of developing IBD in Western populations with variants
that may alter the normal mucosal immunity in the gastrointestinal tract. The
clinical complexity and the heterogeneity of the IBD phenotype probably reflect
the presence of genetic heterogeneity where different genes or combinations of
them may be involved, together with environmental factors. We hypothesized that
patients with early onset IBD could have either more severe genetic variants in
genes associated with IBD or multiple variants in different genes. Under the
multifactorial diseases is crucial to consider the small contribution of a single
variant in all not only to other small variations in the same gene but also in
different genes belonging to the same pathway. We performed direct gene
sequencing looking for 94 variations in NOD2, ATG16L1, IL23R, IL10R, IL10 and
XIAP genes previously shown as correlated with IBD both in multifactorial and in 
Mendelian models. All variants identified are known in literature as being
associated with IBD except for three variants in the genes NOD2, IL10 and IL10RB 
that even though present in online databases have never been involved in
association studies on IBD patients. Moreover, we coupled genetic variants
identification with an accurate "in silico" analysis to verify their predictive
impact on the protein structure and function. The in-silico prediction of these
variants results as benign therefore even if they exhibit a very low frequency in
control population being benign, they cannot be considered pathogenic as
monogenic disease but fall within the multifactorial range. The variants
identified in our study partially reflect the association data described in the
literature but there are no significant differences with the onset of disease
(VEO vs EO-IBD).

Evidence from family and twin-based studies provide strong support for a
significant contribution of maternal and fetal genetics to the timing of
parturition and spontaneous preterm birth. However, there has been only modest
success in the discovery of genes predisposing to preterm birth, despite
increasing sophistication of genetic and genomic technology. In contrast, DNA
variants associated with other traits/diseases have been identified. For example,
there is overwhelming evidence that suggests that the nature and intensity of an 
inflammatory response in adults and children are under genetic control. Because
inflammation is often invoked as an etiologic factor in spontaneous preterm
birth, the question of whether spontaneous preterm birth has a genetic
predisposition in the case of pathologic inflammation has been of long-standing
interest to investigators. Here, we review various genetic approaches used for
the discovery of preterm birth genetic variants in the context of
inflammation-associated spontaneous preterm birth. Candidate gene studies have
sought genetic variants that regulate inflammation in the mother and fetus;
however, the promising findings have often not been replicated. Genome-wide
association studies, an approach to the identification of chromosomal loci
responsible for complex traits, have also not yielded compelling evidence for DNA
variants predisposing to preterm birth. A recent genome-wide association study
that included a large number of White women (>40,000) revealed that maternal loci
contribute to preterm birth. Although none of these loci harbored genes directly 
related to innate immunity, the results were replicated. Another approach to
identify DNA variants predisposing to preterm birth is whole exome sequencing,
which examines the DNA sequence of protein-coding regions of the genome. A recent
whole exome sequencing study identified rare mutations in genes encoding for
proteins involved in the negative regulation (dampening) of the innate immune
response (eg, CARD6, CARD8, NLRP10, NLRP12, NOD2, TLR10) and antimicrobial
peptide/proteins (eg, DEFB1, MBL2). These findings support the concept that
preterm labor, at least in part, has an inflammatory etiology, which can be
induced by pathogens (ie, intraamniotic infection) or "danger signals" (alarmins)
released during cellular stress or necrosis (ie, sterile intraamniotic
inflammation). These findings support the notion that preterm birth has a
polygenic basis that involves rare mutations or damaging variants in multiple
genes involved in innate immunity and host defense mechanisms against microbes
and their noxious products. An overlap among the whole exome
sequencing-identified genes and other inflammatory conditions associated with
preterm birth, such as periodontal disease and inflammatory bowel disease, was
observed, which suggests a shared genetic substrate for these conditions. We
propose that whole exome sequencing, as well as whole genome sequencing, is the
most promising approach for the identification of functionally significant
genetic variants responsible for spontaneous preterm birth, at least in the
context of pathologic inflammation. The identification of genes that contribute
to preterm birth by whole exome sequencing, or whole genome sequencing, promises 
to yield valuable population-specific biomarkers to identify the risk for
spontaneous preterm birth and potential strategies to mitigate such a risk.

Candida albicans is well known as a major human fungal pathogen, but it is also a
permanent resident of healthy gastrointestinal tracts. Recent studies have shown 
that the human gut microbial metabolome represents an interesting source of
bioactive molecules with a significant degree of chemical diversity. Some of
these bioactive molecules may have useful antivirulence activities. For instance,
intestinal bacterial species belonging to the Lachnospiraceae family were found
to secrete molecules that attenuate Salmonella pathogenicity and repress the
expression of virulence genes. Here, we have investigated whether the microbial
gut metabolome (GM) contains molecules that might promote the commensal lifestyle
and/or inhibit the expression of virulence of C. albicans in the intestine. We
found that metabolites from human feces inhibited the growth of C. albicans and
other opportunistic yeasts. A genetic screen in C. albicans suggested that TOR is
the molecular target of the antifungal molecule(s) of the GM. In addition, we
found that the GM metabolites inhibit both C. albicans hyphal growth and the
invasion of human enterocytes. The antigrowth and antivirulence activities were
partially recapitulated by secretions from Roseburia spp. and Bacteroides ovatus 
strains, respectively. This study demonstrates that the antimicrobial activity of
the GM can be extended to a eukaryotic pathogen, C. albicans, illuminating the
antagonistic interkingdom interactions between a fungus and intestinal commensal 
bacteria. IMPORTANCECandida albicans is a natural component of the human
microbiota but also an opportunistic pathogen that causes life-threatening
infections. The human gastrointestinal tract is the main reservoir of
C. albicans, from where systemic infections originate as a consequence of the
disruption of the intestinal mucosal barrier. Recent studies provided convincing 
evidence that overgrowth of C. albicans and other related species in the gut is
predominantly associated with chronic intestinal inflammatory bowel diseases.
Here, we showed, for the first time, the antagonistic interkingdom interactions
between C. albicans and common intestinal commensal bacteria. From a therapeutic 
perspective, administering a defined bacterial community, such as the one
described here with anti-Candida activity, could provide potential therapeutic
protection against gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases.

BACKGROUND: The role of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is gaining interest. With the advent of novel
therapies, personalized treatment in IBD is a future goal. We wondered whether
IBD-associated SNPs are able to predict response to anti-TNFα treatment.
METHODS: Data on treatment use and primary response, loss of response and side
effects to anti-TNFα treatments were retrieved for 570 IBD patients. rs13361189
(IRGM), rs10210302 (ATG16L1), rs2066844, rs2066845, rs2066847 (NOD2), rs35873774 
(XBP1), rs11175593 (LRRK2), rs11465804 (IL23R), rs2301436 (CCR6), rs744166
(STAT3) and rs4821544 (NCF4) SNP status were determined.
RESULTS: No associations were found between genetic variants of the LRRK2, CCR6, 
IL23R and NCF4 genes and response to anti-TNFα. For NOD2 and XBP1 associations
were found, however, these associations were not strong enough to survive
multiple testing corrections. Strikingly, patients carrying the ATG16L1 T300A
variant were more likely to be treated with adalimumab, even after correction for
disease phenotype, disease behavior and age (p = 0.004, OR 2.8, CI 1.6-5.0).
CONCLUSIONS: Genetic polymorphisms in the known IBD-associated gene ATG16L1
correlate with requirement of treatment, suggesting a different IBD disease
phenotype in these patients. Further investigation will need to elucidate the
implications of these findings and identify the underlying disease
characteristics.

Fusobacterium spp. present in the oral and gut flora is carcinogenic and is
associated with the risk of pancreatic and colorectal cancers. Fusobacterium spp.
is also implicated in a broad spectrum of human pathologies, including Crohn's
disease and ulcerative colitis (UC). Here we report the complete genome sequence 
of Fusobacterium varium Fv113-g1 (genome size, 3.96 Mb) isolated from a patient
with UC. Comparative genome analyses totally suggested that Fv113-g1 is basically
assigned as F. varium, in particular, it could be reclassified as notable F.
varium subsp. similar to F. ulcerans because of partial shared orthologs.
Compared with the genome sequences of F. varium ATCC 27725 (genome size, 3.30 Mb)
and other strains of Fusobacterium spp., Fv113-g1 possesses many accessary
pan-genome sequences with noteworthy multiple virulence factors, including 44
autotransporters (type V secretion system, T5SS) and 13 Fusobacterium adhesion
(FadA) paralogs involved in potential mucosal inflammation. Indeed, transcriptome
analysis demonstrated that Fv113-g1-specific accessary genes, such as multiple
T5SS and fadA paralogs, showed notably increased expression with D-MEM
cultivation than with brain heart infusion broth. This implied that growth
condition may enhance the expression of such potential virulence factors, leading
to remarkable survival against other gut microorganisms and to the pathogenicity 
to human intestinal epithelium.

BACKGROUND: Genetic variants of TPMT and NUDT15 have been reported to predict the
inter-patient variability in response and toxicity profiles of patients receiving
thiopurine therapy. However, the clinical utility of TPMT genotyping in guiding
thiopurine doses has been questionable, in part due to underlying differences in 
the prevalence of TPMT variants in both Caucasian and Asian populations. Several 
NUDT15 variants have been associated with thiopurine-induced leukopenia,
particularly in Asian cohorts. So far, none have been reported in a multiethnic
Asian population.
AIM: To investigate the associations between TPMT and NUDT15 variants with
thiopurine-induced myelotoxicity in 129 Asian inflammatory bowel disease
patients.
MATERIALS & METHODS: Pyrosequencing was performed to screen for TPMT and NUDT15
variants. Intracellular steady-state metabolite concentrations were quantified
using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: Significant declines in nadir white blood cell, absolute neutrophil
count and platelet counts were observed with increasing copy numbers of the risk 
T allele at NUDT15 c.415C>T locus (overall p < 0.05) within 4, 8 and 12 weeks and
6 months after thiopurine initiation. Patients with low and intermediate NUDT15
activity, as inferred from haplotype pairs, had significantly higher risks of
leukopenia (p = 0.000253) and neutropenia (p = 0.002) compared with patients with
normal NUDT15 activity.
CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the critical relevance of NUDT15
pharmacogenetics in predicting for thiopurine-induced myelotoxicity and confirm
the lack of significance of TPMT variants in Asian inflammatory bowel disease
patients.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified and validated 200 risk
loci for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to date, including risk loci for both
Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Previously studies mainly used single SNP
testing methods and only reported the most significant association within each
locus. Advanced methods are needed to detect additional joint effects of multiple
SNPs and fine map causal variants in presence of strong linkage disequilibrium.
In this study, we applied a powerful Bayesian method to analyze an existing
Immunochip data sets for IBD from the international inflammatory bowel disease
genetics consortium. The method jointly tested single and set-based SNPs in a
unified framework and filtered indirect associations due to linkage
disequilibrium, thereby fine-mapping the most likely IBD variants. Using an
independent collection of individuals from 11 IBD GWAS as validation, our
approach discovered and validated 9 completely new IBD loci and 5 independent
signals (excluding the major histocompatibility complex) near known IBD loci
reaching genome-wide significance. Several of the replicated new loci implicated 
functionally more interpretable genes than previous reports. The epigenetic marks
at our detected IBD signals demonstrated significant activation signatures in
blood cell types and correspondingly substantial repression in stem cells,
suggesting regulatory links between genetic variants and IBD. Our analysis of the
currently largest IBD datasets therefore added new insights that will be integral
to the ongoing efforts in IBD genetics.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Little is known about the magnitude of the risk of anal and
rectal cancer in patients with anal and/or perineal Crohn's disease. We aimed to 
assess the risk of anal and rectal cancer in patients with Crohn's perianal
disease followed up in the Cancers Et Surrisque Associé aux Maladies
Inflammatoires Intestinales En France (CESAME) cohort.
METHODS: We collected data from 19,486 patients with inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD) enrolled in the observational CESAME study in France, from May 2004 through
June 2005; 14.9% of participants had past or current anal and/or perianal Crohn's
disease. Subjects were followed up for a median time of 35 months (interquartile 
range, 29-40 mo). To identify risk factors for anal cancer in the total CESAME
population, we performed a case-control study in which participants were matched 
for age and sex.
RESULTS: Among the total IBD population, 8 patients developed anal cancer and 14 
patients developed rectal cancer. In the subgroup of 2911 patients with past or
current anal and/or perianal Crohn's lesions at cohort entry, 2 developed anal
squamous-cell carcinoma, 3 developed perianal fistula-related adenocarcinoma, and
6 developed rectal cancer. The corresponding incidence rates were 0.26 per 1000
patient-years for anal squamous-cell carcinoma, 0.38 per 1000 patient-years for
perianal fistula-related adenocarcinoma, and 0.77 per 1000 patient-years for
rectal cancer. Among the 16,575 patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's
disease without anal or perianal lesions, the incidence rate of anal cancer was
0.08 per 1000 patient-years and of rectal cancer was 0.21 per 1000 patient-years.
Among factors tested by univariate conditional regression (IBD subtype, disease
duration, exposure to immune-suppressive therapy, presence of past or current
anal and/or perianal lesions), the presence of past or current anal and/or
perianal lesions at cohort entry was the only factor significantly associated
with development of anal cancer (odds ratio, 11.2; 95% CI, 1.18-551.51; P = .03).
CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of data from the CESAME cohort in France, patients
with anal and/or perianal Crohn's disease have a high risk of anal cancer,
including perianal fistula-related cancer, and a high risk of rectal cancer.

The thiopurine drugs 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and azathiopurine (AZA) are widely
used to treat inflammatory bowel disease. However, the incidence of adverse
reactions is high, particularly in Asia, and the mechanisms of toxicity in Asian 
populations remain unclear. Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) is a well-known
enzyme that inactivates AZA or 6-MP through methylation and is one of the few
pharmacogenetic predictors used in clinical settings in Western countries.
Individuals carrying TPMT-deficient genetic variants require reduced drug doses, 
but this treatment modification is are not applicable to East Asian populations. 
Several genes code thiopurine-metabolizing enzymes, including TPMT,
multidrug-resistance protein 4, and inosine triphosphatase. These genes have been
studied as candidate pharmacogenetic markers; however, it remains unclear why
Asian populations seem to be more intolerant than other ethnic groups to a full
dose of thiopurines. A genome-wide association approach to identify
Asian-specific pharmacogenetic markers in Korean patients with Crohn's disease
revealed that a non-synonymous single nucelotide polymorphism in nucleoside
diphosphate-linked moiety X-type motif 15 (NUDT15) which causes p.Arg139Cys was
strongly associated with thiopurine-induced early leukopenia. Six common
haplotypes of NUDT15 were reported, and five variants showed medium-to-low enzyme
activities, compared with the wild haplotype. NUDT15 hydrolyzes the thiopurine
active metabolites 6-thio-GTP and 6-thio-dGTP; variants of NUDT15 had lower
enzyme activities, causing higher levels of thiopurine active metabolites,
resulting in thiopurine-induced leukopenia. In clinical application, NUDT15
genotyping is a good candidate for predicting thiopurine toxicity in East Asian
populations. However, the association of NUDT15 diplotypes with thiopurine
toxicity remains unclear. Further analyses with large cohorts to confirm the
clinical effects of each haplotype are planned.

There is a need for functional in vitro 3D human intestine systems that can
bridge the gap between conventional cell culture studies and human trials. The
successful engineering in vitro of human intestinal tissues relies on the use of 
the appropriate cell sources, biomimetic scaffolds, and 3D culture conditions to 
support vital organ functions. We previously established a compartmentalized
scaffold consisting of a hollow space within a porous bulk matrix, in which a
functional and physiologically relevant intestinal epithelium system was
generated using intestinal cell lines. In this study, we adopt the 3D scaffold
system for the cultivation of stem cell-derived human small intestinal enteriods 
(HIEs) to engineer an in vitro 3D model of a nonstransformed human small
intestinal epithelium. Characterization of tissue properties revealed a mature
HIE-derived epithelium displaying four major terminally differentiated epithelial
cell types (enterocytes, Goblet cells, Paneth cells, enteroendocrine cells), with
tight junction formation, microvilli polarization, digestive enzyme secretion,
and low oxygen tension in the lumen. Moreover, the tissue model demonstrates
significant antibacterial responses to E. coli infection, as evidenced by the
significant upregulation of genes involved in the innate immune response.
Importantly, many of these genes are activated in human patients with
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), implicating the potential application of the 3D
stem-cell derived epithelium for the in vitro study of host-microbe-pathogen
interplay and IBD pathogenesis.

CD44 is a transmembrane molecule appearing in numerous isoforms generated by
insertions of alternatively spliced variant exons (CD44v) and having various
binding partners. CD44v7 on T cells was proposed to promote colitis by preventing
T-cell apoptosis. Here we demonstrate that Cd44v7-deficient T cells - like Cd44
wild-type (Cd44WT) T cells - provoked disease in two different colitis models:
the model induced by CD4+CD45RBhigh T-cell transfer into Rag2-deficient mice and 
a new model based on ovalbumin (OVA)-specific T-cell transfer into
Rag-sufficient, OVA-challenged mice. In contrast, CD44v7 absence on macrophages
in recipient mice prevented colitis. Prevention was associated with the
downregulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3
(STAT3)-activating and Foxp3-counteracting interleukin-6 (IL-6), lower numbers of
phospho-STAT3-containing lymphocytes, and higher Foxp3+ T-cell counts in the
colon. Consequently, the protected colons showed lower IL-12, IL-1β expression,
and decreased interferon-γ levels. Importantly, stimulation of T cells by
Cd44v7-deficient macrophages induced upregulation of Foxp3 in vitro, while
cotransfer of Cd44WT macrophages into Cd44v7-deficient mice reduced Foxp3+ T-cell
counts and caused colitis. Accordingly, the CD44v7 ligand osteopontin, whose
levels were elevated in Crohn's disease, specifically induced IL-6 in human
monocytes, a cytokine also increased in these patients. We suggest
macrophage-specific targeting of the CD44v7 pathway as a novel therapeutic option
for Crohn's disease.

Our previous study demonstrated that supplemental psyllium fibre increased
cytoprotective heat-shock protein (Hsp) 25 levels in the intestinal cells of
mice. Here, we examined the effect of psyllium fibre on colonic gene and protein 
expression and faecal microbiota in normal and colitic mice to improve the
understanding of the preventive role of the supplement. DNA microarray analysis
revealed that a 10 % psyllium fibre diet administered for 5 d up-regulated eleven
extracellular matrix (ECM)-associated genes, including collagens and
fibronectins, in normal mice. Acute colitis was induced using dextran sodium
sulphate (DSS) in mice that were administered a pre-feeding 5 to 10 % psyllium
fibre diet for 5 d. Psyllium fibre partially ameliorated or resolved the
DSS-induced colon damage and inflammation characterised by body weight loss,
colon shortening, increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased
tight junction protein expression in the colon. Analysis of faecal microbiota
using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of the PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene 
demonstrated that psyllium fibre affected the colonic microbiota. Intestinal
permeability was evaluated by growing intestinal Caco-2 cell monolayers on
membrane filter supports coated with or without fibronectin and collagen. Cells
grown on collagen and fibronectin coating showed higher transepithelial
electrical resistance, indicating a strengthening of barrier integrity.
Therefore, increased Hsp25 levels and modification of colonic ECM contribute to
the observed psyllium-mediated protection against DSS-induced colitis.
Furthermore, ECM modification appears to play a role in the strengthening of the

intestinal inflammatory diseases.

BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by chronic
inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract that is associated with changes in the
gut microbiome. Here, we sought to identify strain-specific functional correlates
with IBD outcomes.
METHODS: We performed metagenomic sequencing of monthly stool samples from 20 IBD
patients and 12 controls (266 total samples). These were taxonomically profiled
with MetaPhlAn2 and functionally profiled using HUMAnN2. Differentially abundant 
species were identified using MaAsLin and strain-specific pangenome haplotypes
were analyzed using PanPhlAn.
RESULTS: We found a significantly higher abundance in patients of facultative
anaerobes that can tolerate the increased oxidative stress of the IBD gut. We
also detected dramatic, yet transient, blooms of Ruminococcus gnavus in IBD
patients, often co-occurring with increased disease activity. We identified two
distinct clades of R. gnavus strains, one of which is enriched in IBD patients.
To study functional differences between these two clades, we augmented the R.
gnavus pangenome by sequencing nine isolates from IBD patients. We identified 199
IBD-specific, strain-specific genes involved in oxidative stress responses,
adhesion, iron-acquisition, and mucus utilization, potentially conferring an
adaptive advantage for this R. gnavus clade in the IBD gut.
CONCLUSIONS: This study adds further evidence to the hypothesis that increased
oxidative stress may be a major factor shaping the dysbiosis of the microbiome
observed in IBD and suggests that R. gnavus may be an important member of the
altered gut community in IBD.

Crohn disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease which progressively affects 
the digestive tract with unknown etiology. During the disease course, intestinal 
fibrosis will gradually develop in many CD patients and results in irreversible
fibrosis stricture, causing refractory abdominal pain and even intestinal
obstruction, and necessitating one or more surgical interventions. Thus far the
exact etiology of CD remains unknown. It is believed that genetic, environmental 
and immunologic factors are involved, which may also predict the development of
intestinal fibrosis. Recent studies have found the association of mutations in
genes, such as NOD2, ATG16L1, CX3CR1, IL-23R and MMP3 with the fibrogenic
phenotype of CD. In addition, serum extracellular matrix molecules, growth
factors, miRNAs and microbial antibodies have also been linked to the
fibrogenesis in CD patients, however the results of researches were divergent.
Therefore it is of significance to explore noninvasive markers of intestinal
fibrosis with high sensitivity and specificity, and the high-throughput proteomic
technique may be an approach that deserves further investigation. Screening the
high-risk patients for the fibrostenotic phenotype of CD by susceptibility genes,
and early detection of intestinal fibrosis using noninvasive serum markers, will 
help improve the treatment outcomes and reduce the surgical rates. The article
aims at summarizing the current susceptibility genes and serum markers of
intestinal fibrosis in CD.

Na+/H+ exchanger-3 (NHE3) is crucial for intestinal Na+ absorption, and its
reduction has been implicated in infectious and inflammatory bowel diseases
(IBD)-associated diarrhea. Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation are
involved in the pathophysiology of IBD. Whether changes in DNA methylation are
involved in modulating intestinal NHE3 gene expression is not known. Caco-2 and
HuTu 80 cells were used as models of human intestinal epithelial cells. Normal
C57/BL6, wild-type, or growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45b (GADD45b)
knockout (KO) mice were used as in vivo models. NHE3 gene DNA methylation levels 
were assessed by MBDCap (MethyMiner) assays. Results demonstrated that in vitro
methylation of NHE3 promoter construct (p-1509/+127) cloned into a cytosine
guanine dinucleotide-free lucia vector decreased the promoter activity in Caco-2 
cells. DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azacytidine (10 μM, 24 h) caused a
significant decrease in DNA methylation of the NHE3 gene and concomitantly
increased NHE3 expression in Caco-2 cells. Similarly, 5-azacytidine treatment
increased NHE3 mRNA levels in HuTu 80 cells. 5-Azacytidine treatment for 3 wk (10
mg/kg body wt ip, 3 times/wk) also resulted in an increase in NHE3 expression in 
the mouse ileum and colon. Small-interfering RNA knockdown of GADD45b (protein
involved in DNA demethylation) in Caco-2 cells decreased NHE3 mRNA expression.
Furthermore, there was a significant decrease in NHE3 mRNA and protein expression
in the ileum and colon of GADD45b KO mice. Our findings demonstrate that NHE3
gene expression is regulated by changes in its DNA methylation. NEW & NOTEWORTHY 
Our studies for the first time demonstrate that Na+/H+ exchanger-3 gene
expression is regulated by an epigenetic mechanism involving DNA methylation.

Innate immune factors exert widespread effects on cytokine secretion, cell
survival, autophagy, and apoptosis. Nucleotide-binding and oligomerization
domain-like receptors (NLRs) are members of the innate immune system in the
cytosol that sense pathogens, endogenous danger molecules such as uric acid, and 
pollutants. Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 1 and 2 
(NOD1 and NOD2) are components of NLR family, and ligands of these factors are
γ-D-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid (iE-DAP) and muramyl dipeptide (MDP),
respectively. Upon recognition of ligands, NOD1 and NOD2 induce the production of
inflammatory cytokines and transcription factors including interleukin-6 (IL-6)
and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). We examined the function of NOD1 and NOD2 in
innate immunity, with a focus on their differing roles in disease pathogenesis
between Japanese and Caucasian populations. Susceptibility to several
immune-related diseases, including Crohn's disease, colorectal and breast
cancers, and graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) showed a correlation with genetic
variants of NOD2 in Caucasian, but not in Japanese, populations. This difference 
may be primarily due to the fact that three major NOD2 SNPs (R702W, G908R,
L1007insC) prevalent in Caucasians are rare or absent in Japanese populations.
Because NLR has diverse effects on immune function, it is possible that many as
yet uncharacterized immune-related diseases will also show different
susceptibilities between races due to the different ratio of genetic variants in 
innate immune genes.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is the chronic inflammation of the
gastrointestinal tract. Recently, studies of the interplay between the adaptive
and innate immune responses have provided a better understanding of the
immunopathogenesis of inflammatory disorders such as IBD, as well as
identification of novel targets for more potent interventions. Toll-like
receptors (TLRs) are a class of proteins that play a significant role in the
innate immune system and are involved in inflammatory processes. Activation of
TLR signal transduction pathways lead to the induction of numerous genes that
function in host defense, including those for inflammatory cytokines, chemokines,
and antigen presenting molecules. It was proposed that TLR mutations and
dysregulation are major contributing factors to the predisposition and
susceptibility to IBD. Thus, modulating TLRs represent an innovative
immunotherapeutic approach in IBD therapy. This article outlines the role of TLRs
in IBD, focusing on both animal and human studies; the role of TLR-targeted
agonists or antagonists as potential therapeutic agents in the different stages
of the disease is discussed.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an idiopathic prolonged ailment accountable
for inflammatory conditions of the intestine. Moreover, arthritis is responsible 
for joints' stiffness and painful inflammation. IBD shows certain articular
extra-intestinal manifestations associating IBD with arthritis. IBD associated
arthritis is found to be linked with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). The present
study insights for the potential and putative drug targets and biomarkers of IBD 
associated with arthritis using in silico approaches. Microarray data analysis of
datasets involving IBD affected and AS affected vs controls were done to explore 
the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). In majority of the datasets, the
common DEGs found were sterile alpha motif domain containing 9 like (SAMD9L),
inhibin beta A subunit (INHBA), transmembrane protein 45A (TMEM45A) and
transmembrane and tetratricopeptide repeat containing 1 (TMTC1). The common
functions and pathways found between the DEGs were control of macromolecule
metabolism process, control of metabolic process, control of primary metabolic
process, and control of protein metabolic process, cell differentiation, organ
development, single-organism development process, multicellular organism
development process, development of system, single-multicellular organism
development process, developmental process, development of anatomical structure, 
multicellular organismal development process, control of biological process, cell
proliferation, hematopoietic progenitor cell differentiation and immune system
process. TMTC1 and INBHA were found to be more biologically significant genes
according to the topological properties of the network. This study also suggests 
that TMTC1, INBHA, TMEM45A and SAMD9L DEGs and their accompanying pathways might 
have the potential to be exploited as drug targets and biomarkers in the
diagnosis and/or treatment of IBD linked arthritis and warrants for further
experimental validation.

Pattern recognition receptors such as nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain
(NOD)-containing protein receptors (NLRs) and the pyrin and hematopoitic
interferon-inducible nuclear protein (HIN) domain (PYHIN) receptors initiate the 
inflammatory response following cell stress or pathogenic challenge. When
activated, some of these receptors oligomerize to form the structural backbone of
a signalling platform known as an inflammasome. Inflammasomes promote the
activation of caspase-1 and the maturation of the proinflammatory cytokines,
interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18. The gut dysregulation of the inflammasome complex 
is thought to be a contributing factor in the development of inflammatory bowel
diseases (IBD), such as ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The
importance of inflammasomes to intestinal health has been emphasized by various
inflammasome-deficient mice in dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) models of intestinal
inflammation and by the identification of novel potential candidate genes in
population-based human studies. In this review, we summarise the most recent
findings with regard to the formation, sensing, and regulation of the
inflammasome complex and highlight their importance in maintaining intestinal
health.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a common chronic intestinal disorder
characterised by a loss of epithelial barrier function leading to the unregulated
movement of luminal antigenic material into mucosal tissue with resultant
inflammation. In IBD, multiple components of the inflammatory response lead to
tissue hypoxia. Mucosal hypoxia leads to the inactivation of prolyl hydroxylase
domain-containing (PHD) enzymes, which in turn leads to the stabilisation of the 
hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), which induces the expression of barrier
protective genes. Furthermore, pharmacological hydroxylase inhibition has been
shown to be protective in colitis, at least in part through enhancing intestinal 
epithelial barrier function through HIF-1-dependent barrier-protective gene
expression. Therefore, targeting hypoxia-sensitive pathways represents a new and 
promising therapeutic approach in IBD.

Genetic studies in complex diseases have been highly successful, but have also
been largely one-dimensional: predominantly focusing on the genetic contribution 
to disease susceptibility. While this is undoubtedly important-indeed it is a
pre-requisite for understanding the mechanisms underlying disease
development-there are many other important aspects of disease biology that have
received comparatively little attention. In this review, I will discuss how
existing genetic data can be leveraged to provide new insights into other aspects
of disease biology, why such insights could change the way we think about complex
disease, and how this could provide opportunities for better therapies and/or
facilitate personalised medicine. To do this, I will use the example of Crohn's
disease-a chronic form of inflammatory bowel disease that has been one of the
main success stories in complex disease genetics. Indeed, thanks to genetic
studies, we now have a much more detailed understanding of the processes involved
in Crohn's disease development, but still know relatively little about what
determines the subsequent disease course (prognosis) and why this differs so
considerably between individuals. I will discuss how we came to realise that
genetic variation plays an important role in determining disease prognosis and
how this has changed the way we think about Crohn's disease genetics. This will
illustrate how phenotypic data can be used to leverage new insights from genetic 
data and will provide a broadly applicable framework that could yield new
insights into the biology of multiple diseases.

Novel ADCC effector cells expressing the V-variant or F-variant of FcγRIIIa
(CD16a) and firefly luciferase under the control of a chimeric promoter
incorporating recognition sequences for the principal transcription factors
involved in FcγRIIIa signal transduction, together with novel target cells
overexpressing a constant high level of the specific antigen recognized by
rituximab, trastuzumab, cetuximab, infliximab, adalimumab, or etanercept, confer 
improved sensitivity, specificity, and dynamic range in an ADCC assay relative to
effector cells expressing a NFAT-regulated reporter gene and wild-type target
cells. The effector cells also contain a normalization gene rendering ADCC assays
independent of cell number or serum matrix effects. The novel effector and target
cells in a frozen thaw-and-use format exhibit low vial-to-vial and lot-to-lot
variation in their performance characteristics reflected by CVs of 10% or less.
Homologous control target cells in which the specific target gene has been
invalidated by genome editing providing an ideal control and a means of
correcting for nonspecific effects were observed with certain samples of human
serum. The novel effector cells and target cells expressing noncleavable
membrane-bound TNFα have been used to quantify ADCC activity in serum from
patients with Crohn's disease treated with infliximab and to relate ADCC activity
to drug levels.

INTRODUCTION: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic, disabling disease of the
gastrointestinal tract that mostly affects young adults. Despite extensive
research, the pathogenesis of CD is still not completely understood. It is
thought that an abnormal mucosal immune response is elicited towards the luminal 
microbiota in genetically predisposed persons. Genome-wide association studies
and meta-analysis have greatly improved our insight into the genetic background
of CD. One of the most studied CD-associated genes is nucleotide-binding
oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2). Areas covered: We summarize the current
knowledge about NOD2, its use in clinical practice, the functional implications
of NOD2 mutations and the therapeutic options for targeting NOD2 in CD. Expert
opinion: Almost 2 decades after the identification of NOD2 variants in CD, it has
become clear that wild type NOD2 is involved in preserving intestinal barrier
integrity and immune homeostasis, properly functioning autophagy and balancing
the gut microbiota composition. Given the high prevalence and effect size of NOD2
risk alleles in patients with CD and their interplay with important molecular
pathways involved in the disease, NOD2 should seriously be considered as a
therapeutic target for CD. Several therapeutic approaches exist and these should 
be further explored to treat NOD2-related deficiencies in CD.

Genetic defects that affect intestinal epithelial barrier function can present
with very early-onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEOIBD). Using whole-genome
sequencing, a novel hemizygous defect in NOX1 encoding NAPDH oxidase 1 was
identified in a patient with ulcerative colitis-like VEOIBD. Exome screening of
1,878 pediatric patients identified further seven male inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD) patients with rare NOX1 mutations. Loss-of-function was validated in
p.N122H and p.T497A, and to a lesser degree in p.Y470H, p.R287Q, p.I67M, p.Q293R 
as well as the previously described p.P330S, and the common NOX1 SNP p.D360N
(rs34688635) variant. The missense mutation p.N122H abrogated reactive oxygen
species (ROS) production in cell lines, ex vivo colonic explants, and
patient-derived colonic organoid cultures. Within colonic crypts, NOX1
constitutively generates a high level of ROS in the crypt lumen. Analysis of
9,513 controls and 11,140 IBD patients of non-Jewish European ancestry did not
reveal an association between p.D360N and IBD. Our data suggest that
loss-of-function variants in NOX1 do not cause a Mendelian disorder of high
penetrance but are a context-specific modifier. Our results implicate that
variants in NOX1 change brush border ROS within colonic crypts at the interface
between the epithelium and luminal microbes.

The pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) reflects a balance
between mucosal injury and reparative mechanisms. Some regenerating gene (Reg)
family members have been reported to be expressed in Crohn's disease (CD) and
ulcerative colitis (UC) and to be involved as proliferative mucosal factors in
IBD. However, expression of all REG family genes in IBD is still unclear. Here,
we analyzed expression of all REG family genes (REG Iα, REG Iβ, REG III, HIP/PAP,
and REG IV) in biopsy specimens of UC and CD by real-time RT-PCR. REG Iα, REG Iβ,
and REG IV genes were overexpressed in CD samples. REG IV gene was also
overexpressed in UC samples. We further analyzed the expression mechanisms of REG
Iα, REG Iβ, and REG IV genes in human colon cells. The expression of REG Iα was
significantly induced by IL-6 or IL-22, and REG Iβ was induced by IL-22. Deletion
analyses revealed that three regions (- 220 to - 211, - 179 to - 156, and - 146
to - 130) in REG Iα and the region (- 274 to- 260) in REG Iβ promoter were
responsible for the activation by IL-22/IL-6. The promoters contain consensus
transcription factor binding sequences for MZF1, RTEF1/TEAD4, and STAT3 in REG
Iα, and HLTF/FOXN2F in REG Iβ, respectively. The introduction of siRNAs for MZF1,
RTEF1/TEAD4, STAT3, and HLTF/FOXN2F abolished the transcription of REG Iα and REG
Iβ. The gene activation mechanisms of REG Iα/REG Iβ may play a role in colon
mucosal regeneration in IBD.

OBJECTIVES: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) results from dysregulation of
intestinal mucosal immunity. It is an incurable disease that affects millions of 
people worldwide. Developing new strategies for the treatment of colitis has been
a major challenge. Here, we report the effect of calycosin, a plant-derived
flavonoid, in successfully managing colitis in murine model.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In vivo model of colitis was induced using 2.5% (w/v)
dextran sodium sulfate (DSS, 36,000 to 50,000 Mw). Body weight and disease
activity index (DAI) were evaluated every day. Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) staining
was used to estimate the effect of calycosin on DSS-induced colon damage. The
levels of proinflammatory genes and mRNA expression were determined using
real-time PCR, whereas the proinflammatory cytokines were assessed with ELISA.
The content of other parameters including myeloperoxidase (MPO), glutathione
(GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were also evaluated. 
Western blot assay was further used to determine the effect of calycosin on both 
NF-κB and mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathways.
RESULTS: The results showed that calycosin prevented weight loss and shortening
of the colon length, maintained an intact mucosa, increased GSH and SOD
activities, and decreased MDA levels. The drug also significantly inhibited
proinflammatory cytokine mRNA expression and decreased MPO activity.
Additionally, it remarkably inhibited NF-κB pathway and c-Jun N-terminal kinase
(JNK) phosphorylation with no effect on p38 and extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (ERK1/2) phosphorylation levels in colon tissue.
CONCLUSION: These findings revealed that calycosin successfully ameliorated the
effect of DSS-induced colitis in mice, which could be associated with NF-κB and
JNK pathway modulations.

Depression and anxiety are common comorbid disorders observed in patients with
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Increasing line of evidence indicates that
immune-inflammatory responses are involved in co-occurrence of mood disorders and
IBD. However, the mechanisms through which immune-inflammatory pathways modulate 
this comorbidity are not yet understood. This study investigated the role of
innate immunity in the development of behavioral abnormalities associated with an
animal model of Crohn's disease (CD). To do this, we induced colitis in male
adult mice by intrarectal (i.r.) injection of DNBS (Dinitrobenzene sulfonic
acid). After 3 days, we performed behavioral tests for anxiety- and
depressive-like behaviors as well as tissue collection. Our results showed that
DNBS-induced colonic inflammatory responses were accompanied by infiltration of
inflammatory cells, and increased expression of genes involved in toll-like
receptor signaling pathway in intestinal tissue. Furthermore, the DNBS-treated
mice showed depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors which were associated with
increased expression of the inflammatory genes and abnormal mitochondrial
function in the hippocampus. These results suggest that peripheral inflammation
is able to increase the transcriptional level of the genes in toll-like receptor 
pathway, induces abnormal mitochondrial function in the hippocampus, and these
negative effects may be involved in the co-occurrence of anxiety and depression
in early stages of CD.

BACKGROUND: Certain Enterobacteriaceae strains have been associated with the
development of ulcerative colitis (UC). Extended-spectrum β-lactamase
(ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae are the most commonly found
multi-drug-resistant (MDR) bacteria colonizing the gut in UC patients and might
trigger a more severe disease activity in UC patients.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether disease activity is
higher in UC patients with gut colonization with ESBL-producing
Enterobacteriaceae.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional, pilot study was carried out in a
tertiary medical center in Latvia. Demographic data were collected; UC disease
activity and extent were evaluated according to the full Mayo score, Montreal
classification, and adapted Truelove and Witt's index. Rectal swabs with fecal
biomaterial were collected, ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae were isolated, and 
bacterial plasmid genes responsible for ESBL production, blaCTX-M, blaTEM, and
blaSHV, were detected. UC disease activity was compared in patients with and
without gut colonization with ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae.
RESULTS: A total of 65 patients with UC were included in the initial analysis.
Gut colonization with ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae was found in seven (11%) 
patients - mostly Escherichia coli [5 (71%)] containing the blaCTX-M bacterial
plasmid gene. Patients with gut colonization with ESBL-producing
Enterobacteriaceae had more severe disease compared with patients without gut
colonization according to the full Mayo score (5.86 vs. 3.40; P=0.015), Montreal 
classification (moderate disease vs. clinical remission; P=0.031), and adapted
Truelove and Witt's index (moderate disease vs. mild disease; P=0.008).
CONCLUSION: Gut colonization with ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae may increase 
UC disease activity. Further research is needed to analyze the possible
confounding factors that could contribute toward this outcome.

BACKGROUND: Tumor suppressor gene p53 expression has been reported in patients
with ulcerative colitis (UC). However, the correlation between p53 expression and
UC remains controversial. The aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate the
association between p53 expression and different pathological types of UC.
METHODS: Publications were searched in the PubMed, Embase, EBSCO, Wangfang, and
CNKI databases. The overall odds ratios (ORs) and their corresponding 95%
confidence intervals (95% CIs) were summarized in this study.
RESULTS: Final 19 papers were identified in this meta-analysis, including 1068
patients with UC and 130 normal tissue samples. Immunohistochemical p53
expression was significantly higher in UC without dysplasia and carcinoma (UC
group) compared to normal tissue samples (OR = 3.14, P = 0.001), higher in UC
with dysplasia than in UC group (OR = 10.76, P < 0.001), and higher in UC with
colorectal cancer (CRC) than in UC with dysplasia (OR = 1.69, P = 0.035).
Subgroup analysis of ethnicity (UC group vs. normal tissues) showed that p53
expression was correlated with UC in Asians, but not in Caucasians. When UC with 
dysplasia was compared to UC group, p53 expression was linked to UC with
dysplasia among both Asians and Caucasians. When UC-CRC was compared to UC with
dysplasia, p53 expression was not associated with UC-CRC in both Caucasians and
Asians.
CONCLUSIONS: p53 expression was closely associated with UC-CRC development. p53
expression showed different ethnic characteristics among different pathological
types of UC.

Understanding the transcription factors that modulate epithelial resistance to
injury is necessary for understanding intestinal homeostasis and injury repair
processes. Recently, transcription factor EB (TFEB) was implicated in expression 
of autophagy and host defense genes in nematodes and mammalian cells. However,
the in vivo roles of TFEB in the mammalian intestinal epithelium were not known. 
Here, we used mice with a conditional deletion of Tfeb in the intestinal
epithelium (Tfeb ΔIEC) to examine its importance in defense against injury.
Unperturbed Tfeb ΔIEC mice exhibited grossly normal intestinal epithelia, except 
for a defect in Paneth cell granules. Tfeb ΔIEC mice exhibited lower levels of
lipoprotein ApoA1 expression, which is downregulated in Crohn's disease patients 
and causally linked to colitis susceptibility. Upon environmental epithelial
injury using dextran sodium sulfate (DSS), Tfeb ΔIEC mice exhibited exaggerated
colitis. Thus, our study reveals that TFEB is critical for resistance to
intestinal epithelial cell injury, potentially mediated by APOA1.

BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are epigenetically involved in regulating gene
expression. They may be of importance in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD). The aim of this study was to determine the role of miRNAs by their
specific blocking in the CD4+CB45RBhi T-cell transfer model of chronic
experimental colitis.
METHODS: Colitis caused by transfer of WT CD4+CD45RBhi T cells in severe combined
immunodeficiency (SCID) mice shares many features with human IBD. Colonic miRNA
expression levels were measured at three time points in colitic mice, where a
time-dependent upregulation of multiple miRNAs was seen. To inhibit these miRNAs,
specific locked-nucleic-acid-modified (LNA) oligonucleotides were administered in
further experiments at the moment the mice demonstrated the first signs of
colitis. As controls, PBS and a scrambled sequence of anti-miRNA were used.
Genome-wide expression analyses were also performed in order to detect candidate 
target genes of miR-142-5p, of which inhibition resulted in most effective
amelioration of colitis.
RESULTS: Anti-miR-142-5p reduced colitis and related wasting disease when
administered in the T-cell transfer model, reflected in reduced weight loss and a
lower disease activity index (DAI). In further validation experiments we also
observed a higher survival rate and less colonic histological inflammation in the
antagomir-treated mice. Moreover, by genome-wide expression analyses, we found
downstream activation of the anti-inflammatory IL10RA pathway, including three
genes also found in the top-20 candidate target genes of miR-142-5p.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, CD4+CD45RBhi-transfer colitis induces miR-142-5p.
Blocking miR-142-5p reduced colitis and prevented wasting disease, possibly by
activation of the IL10RA pathway.

RATIONALE: Overall validity of existing genetic biomarkers in the diagnosis of
obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) remains unclear. The objective of this systematic
genetic study is to identify "novel" biomarkers for OSA using systems biology
approach.
METHODS: Candidate genes for OSA were extracted from PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase 
search engines and DisGeNET database. The gene ontology (GO) analyses and
candidate genes prioritization were performed using Enrichr tool. Genes
pertaining to the top 10 pathways were extracted and used for Ingenuity Pathway
Analysis.
RESULTS: In total, we have identified 153 genes. The top 10 pathways associated
with OSA include (i) serotonin receptor interaction, (ii) pathways in cancer,
(iii) AGE-RAGE signaling in diabetes, (iv) infectious diseases, (v) serotonergic 
synapse, (vi) inflammatory bowel disease, (vii) HIF-1 signaling pathway, (viii)
PI3-AKT signaling pathway, (ix) regulation lipolysis in adipocytes, and (x)
rheumatoid arthritis. After removing the overlapping genes, we have identified 23
candidate genes, out of which >30% of the genes were related to the genes
involved in the serotonin pathway. Among these 4 serotonin receptors SLC6A4,
HTR2C, HTR2A, and HTR1B were strongly associated with OSA.
CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary report identifies several potential candidate genes
associated with OSA and also describes the possible regulatory mechanisms.

Constitutive cell-autonomous immunity in metazoans predates interferon-inducible 
immunity and comprises primordial innate defense. Phagocytes mobilize
interferon-inducible responses upon engagement of well-characterized signaling
pathways by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). The signals
controlling deployment of constitutive cell-autonomous responses during infection
have remained elusive. Vita-PAMPs denote microbial viability, signaling the
danger of cellular exploitation by intracellular pathogens. We show that
cyclic-di-adenosine monophosphate in live Gram-positive bacteria is a vita-PAMP, 
engaging the innate sensor stimulator of interferon genes (STING) to mediate
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Subsequent inactivation of the mechanistic
target of rapamycin mobilizes autophagy, which sequesters stressed ER membranes, 
resolves ER stress, and curtails phagocyte death. This vita-PAMP-induced ER-phagy
additionally orchestrates an interferon response by localizing ER-resident STING 
to autophagosomes. Our findings identify stress-mediated ER-phagy as a
cell-autonomous response mobilized by STING-dependent sensing of a specific
vita-PAMP and elucidate how innate receptors engage multilayered homeostatic
mechanisms to promote immunity and survival after infection.

OBJECTIVE: The common association between NOD2/CARD15 and TLR4 gene variants with
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has not been replicated in all studies. We
studied the polymorphism of these two genes in Tunisian patients with IBD.
METHODS: Polymorphisms of NOD2 (R702W, G908R and L1007fs) and TLR4 (Asp299Gly and
Thr399Ile) genes were analyzed in 106 patients with IBD (68 with ulcerative
colitis [UC], 38 with Crohn's disease [CD]) and 160 healthy controls using
polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Genotypes and
phenotypes were correlated.
RESULTS: The mutated allele of TLR4-Thr399Ile was strongly associated with IBD
(9.4% in IBD, 7.4% in UC and 13.2% in CD vs 2.5% in controls; P = 0.0004, 0.014
and 0.00006, respectively). Heterozygous genotypes were significantly more
frequent in patients with IBD (17.0%), UC (14.7%) and CD (21.1%) than in controls
(5.0%) (P = 0.0012, 0.012 and 0.001, respectively). Interestingly, the wild
genotype was found to be protective (odds ratio 0.24). The mutated allele of
TLR4-Asp299Gly was more frequent in controls (6.8%) than in patients with IBD
(2.9%). A phenotypic correlation of Asp299Gly-AG genotype with arthritis in UC
patients was detected (P = 0.003). Regarding the NOD2 gene, the common variations
studied were not polymorphic and there was no genetic association with IBD.
CONCLUSION: The TLR4-Thr399Ile variant was strongly associated with
susceptibility to IBD, whereas TLR4-Asp299Gly seems to play a role in the
clinical expression of UC. The rarity and non-association of NOD2 mutations with 
IBD may reveal a genetic characteristic of the population in our region.

BACKGROUND: Smoking is a strong environmental factor leading to adverse outcomes 
in Crohn's disease, but a more benign course in ulcerative colitis. Several
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with smoking quantity and
behaviour.
AIM: To assess whether smoking-associated SNPs interact with smoking to influence
the clinical course of inflammatory bowel diseases.
METHODS: Genetic and prospectively obtained clinical data from 1434 Swiss
inflammatory bowel disease cohort patients (821 Crohn's disease and 613
ulcerative colitis) were analysed. Six SNPs associated with smoking quantity and 
behaviour (rs588765, rs1051730, rs1329650, rs4105144, rs6474412 and rs3733829)
were combined to form a risk score (range: 0-12) by adding the number of risk
alleles. We calculated multivariate models for smoking, risk of surgery, fistula,
Crohn's disease location and ulcerative colitis disease extent.
RESULTS: In Crohn's disease patients who smoke, the number of surgeries was
associated with the genetic risk score. This translates to a predicted 3.5-fold
(95% confidence interval: 2.4- to 5.7-fold, P<.0001) higher number of surgical
procedures in smokers with 12 risk alleles than individuals with the lowest risk.
Patients with a risk score >7 had a significantly shorter time to first
intestinal surgery. The genetic risk score did not predict surgery in ulcerative 
colitis or occurrence of fistulae in Crohn's disease. SNP rs6265 was associated
with ileal disease in Crohn's disease (P<.05) and proctitis in ulcerative colitis
(P<.05).
CONCLUSIONS: SNPs associated with smoking quantity is associated with an
increased risk for surgery in Crohn's disease patients who smoke. Our data
provide an example of genetics interacting with the environment to influence the 
disease course of inflammatory bowel disease.

Summary: Gene-based supervised machine learning classification models have been
widely used to differentiate disease states, predict disease progression and
determine effective treatment options. However, many of these classifiers are
sensitive to noise and frequently do not replicate in external validation sets.
For complex, heterogeneous diseases, these classifiers are further limited by
being unable to capture varying combinations of genes that lead to the same
phenotype. Pathway-based classification can overcome these challenges by using
robust, aggregate features to represent biological mechanisms. In this work, we
developed a novel pathway-based approach, PRObabilistic Pathway Score, which uses
genes to calculate individualized pathway scores for classification. Unlike
previous individualized pathway-based classification methods that use gene sets, 
we incorporate gene interactions using probabilistic graphical models to more
accurately represent the underlying biology and achieve better performance. We
apply our method to differentiate two similar complex diseases, ulcerative
colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), which are the two main types of
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Using five IBD datasets, we compare our method 
against four gene-based and four alternative pathway-based classifiers in
distinguishing CD from UC. We demonstrate superior classification performance and
provide biological insight into the top pathways separating CD from UC.

OBJECTIVES: Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an immunoregulatory cytokine that has a
central role in suppressing proinflammatory responses. Patients with deleterious 
mutations in interleukin (IL)-10 or IL-10 receptor (IL-10R) genes develop severe 
colitis and perianal disease in the first months of life. Whether IL-10R
expression and signaling in pediatric- or adult-onset Crohn disease (CD) are
altered is unknown. The objective of this study was to characterize IL-10R
expression and IL-10R-mediated suppression in patients with CD.
METHODS: Monocytes were sorted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of
patients with CD and control subjects. IL-10R expression was determined by flow
cytometry. Monocytes were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 3 hours in
the presence of different concentrations of IL-10 to determine IL-10-mediated
suppression of tumor necrosis factor α production. Signaling through the IL-10R
was evaluated by quantifying STAT3 phosphorylation in response to IL-10
stimulation.
RESULTS: Forty-two subjects were enrolled in this study: 19 with CD and 23
controls. Stimulation of monocytes with LPS markedly increased IL-10R expression 
in both groups but to a much lower extent in patients with CD. In addition,
IL-10-mediated suppression of TNFα production upon LPS stimulation and
IL-10-induced STAT3 phosphorylation were attenuated in patients with CD versus
controls. Finally, LPS-stimulated monocytes from patients with CD secreted
significantly lower quantities of IL-10, compared with control monocytes.
CONCLUSIONS: IL-10R expression and signaling are decreased in monocytes from
patients with CD. Additional studies are required to assess whether similar
patterns occur in other innate immune cells, especially in the gut, and whether
disease activity, medical therapy, and genetic factors modulate these findings.

Background and Aims: Ulcerative colitis [UC] is a chronic inflammatory disease
that effects the gastrointestinal tract and is considered one of the most
prominent and common forms of inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]. This study aimed 
to define and describe the entire transcriptomic landscape in a well-stratified, 
treatment-naïve UC patient population compared with control patients by using
next-generation technology, RNA-Seq.
Methods: Mucosal biopsies from treatment-naïve UC patients [n = 14], and healthy 
controls [n = 16] underwent RNA-Seq. Principal component analysis [PCA], cell
deconvolution methods, and diverse statistical methods were applied to obtain and
characterise a dataset of significantly differentially expressed genes [DEGs].
Results: Analyses revealed 1480 significantly DEGs in treatment-naïve UC when
compared with controls. Cell populations of monocytes, T cells, neutrophils, B
cells/ lymphoid cells, and myeloid cells were increased during inflammation,
whereas the fraction of epithelial cells were reduced in UC, which is reflected
by the DEGs; 79 DEGs were identified as IBD susceptibility genes, and 58 DEGs
were expressed in a gender-specific manner. MUC5B, REG3A, DEFA5, and IL33 might
be considered as colorectal cancer [CRC] risk factors following UC in males. AQP9
together with CLDN2 may have a role regulating tissue-specific physiological
properties in tight junctions in UC. An additional functional role for AQP9 in
the synthesis and/or the function of mucus can be implied.
Conclusions: This study reveals new potential players in UC pathogenesis in
general, and provides evidence for a gender-dependent pathogenesis for UC. These 
results can be useful for the development of personalised treatment strategies
for UC in the future.

Inflammatory diseases of the gut are associated with altered electrolyte and
water transport, leading to the development of diarrhea. Epithelially expressed
aquaporins (AQPs) are downregulated in inflammation, although the mechanisms
involved are not known. We hypothesized that AQP3 expression in intestinal
epithelial cells is altered in intestinal inflammation and that these changes are
driven by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α Human colonic adenocarcinoma (HT-29)
cells were treated with TNFα to investigate signaling mechanisms in vitro. AQP3
expression was assessed by real-time PCR and radiolabeled glycerol uptake, with
select inhibitors and a luciferase reporter construct used to further elucidate
intracellular signaling. AQP3 expression was downregulated in HT-29 cells treated
with TNFα Luciferase reporter construct experiments revealed that TNFα
downregulated constitutive transcriptional activity of the AQP3 promoter, and
inhibition of MEK/ERK and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling prevented the
decrease in AQP3 mRNA expression. Constitutive AQP3 expression was suppressed by 
specificity protein (Sp) 3, and knockdown of this transcription factor bound to
the AQP3 promoter was able to partially prevent the TNFα-induced downregulation
of AQP3. TNFα signals through MEK/ERK and NF-κB to enhance the negative
transcriptional control of AQP3 expression exerted by Sp3. Similar mechanisms
regulate numerous ion channels, suggesting a common mechanism by which both ion
and water transport are altered in inflammation.

Background: Endoplasmic reticulum [ER] stress was shown to be pivotal in the
pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. Despite progress in inflammatory
bowel disease [IBD] drug development, not more than one-third of patients achieve
steroid-free remission and mucosal healing with current therapies. Furthermore,
patient stratification tools for therapy selection are lacking. We aimed to
identify and quantify epithelial ER stress in a patient-specific manner in an
attempt towards personalised therapy.
Methods: A biopsy-derived intestinal epithelial cell culture system was developed
and characterised. ER stress was induced by thapsigargin and quantified with a
BiP enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] of cell lysates from 35 patients
with known genotypes, who were grouped based on the number of IBD-associated ER
stress and autophagy risk alleles.
Results: The epithelial character of the cells was confirmed by E-cadherin, ZO-1,
and MUC2 staining and CK-18, CK-20, and LGR5 gene expression. Patients with three
risk alleles had higher median epithelial BiP-induction [vs untreated] levels
compared with patients with one or two risk alleles [p = 0.026 and 0.043,
respectively]. When autophagy risk alleles were included and patients were
stratified in genetic risk quartiles, patients in Q2, Q3, and Q4 had
significantly higher ER stress [BiP] when compared with Q1 [p = 0.034, 0.040, and
0.034, respectively].
Conclusions: We developed and validated an ex vivo intestinal epithelial cell
culture system and showed that patients with more ER stress and autophagy risk
alleles have augmented epithelial ER stress responses. We thus presented a

OBJECTIVE: Roseburia hominis is a flagellated gut anaerobic bacterium belonging
to the Lachnospiraceae family within the Firmicutes phylum. A significant
decrease of R. hominis colonization in the gut of ulcerative colitis patients has
recently been demonstrated. In this work, we have investigated the mechanisms of 
R. hominis-host cross talk using both murine and in vitro models.
DESIGN: The complete genome sequence of R. hominis A2-183 was determined. C3H/HeN
germ-free mice were mono-colonized with R. hominis, and the host-microbe
interaction was studied using histology, transcriptome analyses and FACS. Further
investigations were performed in vitro and using the TLR5KO and DSS-colitis
murine models.
RESULTS: In the bacterium, R. hominis, host gut colonization upregulated genes
involved in conjugation/mobilization, metabolism, motility, and chemotaxis. In
the host cells, bacterial colonization upregulated genes related to antimicrobial
peptides, gut barrier function, toll-like receptors (TLR) signaling, and T cell
biology. CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T cell numbers increased in the lamina propria of both
mono-associated and conventional mice treated with R. hominis. Treatment with the
R. hominis bacterium provided protection against DSS-induced colitis. The role of
flagellin in host-bacterium interaction was also investigated.
CONCLUSION: Mono-association of mice with R. hominis bacteria results in specific
bidirectional gene expression patterns. A set of genes thought to be important
for host colonization are induced in R. hominis, while the host cells respond by 
strengthening gut barrier function and enhancing Treg population expansion,
possibly via TLR5-flagellin signaling. Our data reveal the immunomodulatory
properties of R. hominis that could be useful for the control and treatment of
gut inflammation.

BACKGROUND: Chronic inflammation in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients is the major
risk factor for colitis-associated colon cancer (CAC). Recent evidences have
shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) are implicated in CAC pathogenesis. However, the
interaction of miRNAs with the transcription factors that alleviate CAC has not
been reported.
METHODS: 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) or 3,3'-diindolylmethane
(DIM) were used to activate aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) in azoxymethane
(AOM)/dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced CAC in mice. Real-time PCR was used to
quantify the mRNAs of miRNA and coding genes while western blot and ELISA were
used to quantify protein levels. Silencing miRNA was carried out by means of
electroporation and locked nucleic acid (LNA)-miRNA.
RESULTS: Inducing CAC in mice upregulated miR-132 expression in the colon, spleen
and lymph nodes at all stages of disease development. Activation of Ahr by TCDD
or DIM boosted miR-132 expression and alleviated CAC severity by suppression of
macrophage infiltration and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Interestingly, TCDD, but 
not DIM, augmented a cholinergic anti-inflammation by inducing
acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-targeting miR-132. This anti-inflammation was
manifested by suppressed production of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6. Silencing miR-132
in vivo in TCDD-treated mice abrogated the cholinergic anti-inflammation and
exacerbated CAC. In addition, inhibition of miR-132 in vitro in CD4+ cells and
macrophages mitigated the inhibitory effect of TCDD on AChE catalytic activity.
CONCLUSION: Our findings identify miR-132 as a new molecule implicated in CAC
pathogenesis, and reveal that miR-132 mediates the ameliorating effects of TCDD
on CAC, suggesting miR-132 as a promising therapeutic candidate to control
autoimmune inflammation and tumorigenesis in CAC patients.

Gastrointestinal tract conditions are frequently associated with low bone mineral
density and increased risk of fractures due to osteoporosis, the latter
concerning particularly inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. One of the
candidate genes involved in osteoporosis is the transforming growth factor beta-1
(TGFB1) whose polymorphisms may be responsible for the development of this
disease. The aim of this study was to analyse the frequency of TGFB1 polymorphic 
variants and determine the association between the c.29T>C TGFB1 polymorphism,
and bone mineral density and fractures in IBD patients. The study subjects
included 198 IBD patients [100 suffering from Crohn's disease (CD) and 98 from
ulcerative colitis (UC)] and 41 healthy volunteers as a control group.
Densitometric bone measurements were obtained using dual energy X-ray
absorptiometry. The TGFB1 genotyping was conducted using restriction fragments
length polymorphism. We conducted an analysis of genotype distribution's
concordance with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. We found statistically significant
differences in lumbar spine (L2-L4) and femoral neck BMD and T-scores between CD,
UC and control subgroups. The distribution of TGFB1 polymorphic variants among CD
and UC patients was concordant with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. There were no
statistically significant differences in densitometric parameters (lumbar spine
and femoral neck BMD, T-score, and Z-score) between carriers of different TGFB1
polymorphisms among IBD (CD and UC) patients nor among controls. We have found no
statistically significant differences in the prevalence of low-energy fractures
between groups of different TGFB1 polymorphic variant carriers. The allele dose
effect, recessive effect and dominant effect analysis did not show an association
between low-energy fractures and the TGFB1 polymorphisms among CD and UC
patients. We have not observed an association between the c.29T>C TGFB1
polymorphic variant and the bone mineral density within the cancellous and
cortical bones (L2-L4 and femoral neck, respectively), or the occurrence of
fractures among the IBD patients and their family members.

Evaluation of immune responses in individual immune cell types is important for
the development of new medicines. Here, we propose a computational method
designated ICEPOP (Immune CEll POPulation) to estimate individual immune cell
type responses from bulk tissue and organ samples. The relative gene responses
are scored for each cell type by using the data from differentially expressed
genes derived from control- vs drug-treated sample pairs, and the data from
public databases including ImmGen and IRIS, which contain gene expression
profiles of a variety of immune cells. By ICEPOP, we analysed cell responses
induced by vaccine-adjuvants in the mouse spleen, and extended the analyses to
human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and gut biopsy samples focusing on human
papilloma virus vaccination and inflammatory bowel disease treatment with
Infliximab. In both mouse and human datasets, our method reliably quantified the 
responding immune cell types and provided insightful information, demonstrating
that our method is useful to evaluate immune responses from bulk sample-derived
gene expression data. ICEPOP is available as an interactive web site (
https://vdynamics.shinyapps.io/icepop/ ) and Python package (
https://github.com/ewijaya/icepop ).

The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is an endogenous signalling pathway involved in 
the control of several gastrointestinal (GI) functions at both peripheral and
central levels. In recent years, it has become apparent that the ECS is pivotal
in the regulation of GI motility, secretion and sensitivity, but endocannabinoids
(ECs) are also involved in the regulation of intestinal inflammation and mucosal 
barrier permeability, suggesting their role in the pathophysiology of both
functional and organic GI disorders. Genetic studies in patients with irritable
bowel syndrome (IBS) or inflammatory bowel disease have indeed shown significant 
associations with polymorphisms or mutation in genes encoding for cannabinoid
receptor or enzyme responsible for their catabolism, respectively. Furthermore,
ongoing clinical trials are testing EC agonists/antagonists in the achievement of
symptomatic relief from a number of GI symptoms. Despite this evidence, there is 
a lack of supportive RCTs and relevant data in human beings, and hence, the
possible therapeutic application of these compounds is raising ethical, political
and economic concerns. More recently, the identification of several EC-like
compounds able to modulate ECS function without the typical central side effects 
of cannabino-mimetics has paved the way for emerging peripherally acting drugs.
This review summarizes the possible mechanisms linking the ECS to GI disorders
and describes the most recent advances in the manipulation of the ECS in the
treatment of GI diseases.

Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is the most prevalent symptomatic primary
immune deficiency. With widespread use of immunoglobulin replacement therapy,
non-infectious complications, such as autoimmunity, chronic intestinal
inflammation, and lung disease, have replaced infections as the major cause of
morbidity and mortality in this immune deficiency. The pathogenic mechanisms that
underlie the development of these complications in CVID are not known; however,
there have been numerous associated laboratory findings. Among the most
intriguing of these associations is elevation of interferon signature genes in
CVID patients with inflammatory/autoimmune complications, as a similar gene
expression profile is found in systemic lupus erythematosus and other chronic
inflammatory diseases. Linked with this heightened interferon signature in CVID
is an expansion of circulating IFN-γ-producing innate lymphoid cells. Innate
lymphoid cells are key regulators of both protective and pathogenic immune
responses that have been extensively studied in recent years. Further exploration
of innate lymphoid cell biology in CVID may uncover key mechanisms underlying the
development of inflammatory complications in these patients and may inspire much 
needed novel therapeutic approaches.

Dietary heme can be used by colonic bacteria equipped with heme-uptake systems as
a growth factor and thereby impact on the microbial community structure. The
impact of heme on the gut microbiota composition may be particularly pertinent in
chronic inflammation such as in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), where a strong 
association with gut dysbiosis has been consistently reported. In this study we
investigated the influence of dietary heme on the gut microbiota and inferred
metagenomic composition, and on chemically induced colitis and colitis-associated
adenoma development in mice. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we found that mice
fed a diet supplemented with heme significantly altered their microbiota
composition, characterized by a decrease in α-diversity, a reduction of
Firmicutes and an increase of Proteobacteria, particularly Enterobacteriaceae.
These changes were similar to shifts seen in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-treated
mice to induce colitis. In addition, dietary heme, but not systemically delivered
heme, contributed to the exacerbation of DSS-induced colitis and facilitated
adenoma formation in the azoxymethane/DSS colorectal cancer (CRC) mouse model.
Using inferred metagenomics, we found that the microbiota alterations elicited by
dietary heme resulted in non-beneficial functional shifts, which were also
characteristic of DSS-induced colitis. Furthermore, a reduction in fecal butyrate
levels was found in mice fed the heme supplemented diet compared to mice fed the 
control diet. Iron metabolism genes known to contribute to heme release from red 
blood cells, heme uptake, and heme exporter proteins, were significantly
enriched, indicating a shift toward favoring the growth of bacteria able to
uptake heme and protect against its toxicity. In conclusion, our data suggest
that luminal heme, originating from dietary components or gastrointestinal
bleeding in IBD and, to lesser extent in CRC, directly contributes to microbiota 
dysbiosis. Thus, luminal heme levels may further exacerbate colitis through the
modulation of the gut microbiota and its metagenomic functional composition. Our 
data may have implications in the development of novel targets for therapeutic
approaches aimed at lowering gastrointestinal heme levels through heme chelation 
or degradation using probiotics and nutritional interventions.

Genetic variations of Atg16l1, Slit2 and Rab19 predispose to the development of
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but the relationship between these mutations is
unclear. Here we show that in Drosophila guts lacking the WD40 domain of Atg16,
pre-enteroendocrine (pre-EE) cells accumulate that fail to differentiate into
properly functioning secretory EE cells. Mechanistically, loss of Atg16 or its
binding partner Rab19 impairs Slit production, which normally inhibits EE cell
generation by activating Robo signaling in stem cells. Importantly, loss of Atg16
or decreased Slit/Robo signaling triggers an intestinal inflammatory response.
Surprisingly, analysis of Rab19 and domain-specific Atg16 mutants indicates that 
their stem cell niche regulatory function is independent of autophagy. Our study 
reveals how mutations in these different genes may contribute to IBD.

Background and Aims: Ulcerative colitis [UC] is a chronic inflammatory disease of
the colon. Colonoscopy remains the gold standard for evaluating disease activity,
as clinical symptoms are not sufficiently accurate. The aim of this study is to
identify new accurate non-invasive biomarkers based on whole-blood
transcriptomics that can predict mucosal lesions and response to treatment in UC 
patients.
Methods: Whole-blood samples were collected for a total of 152 UC patients at
endoscopy. Blood RNA from 25 UC individuals and 20 controls was analysed using
microarrays. Genes that correlated with endoscopic activity were validated using 
real-time polymerase chain reaction in an independent group of 111 UC patients,
and a prediction model for mucosal lesions was evaluated. Responsiveness to
treatment was assessed in a longitudinal cohort of 16 UC patients who started
anti-tumour necrosis factor [TNF] therapy and were followed up for 14 weeks.
Results: Microarray analysis identified 122 genes significantly altered in the
blood of endoscopically active UC patients. A significant correlation with the
degree of endoscopic activity was observed in several genes, including HP, CD177,
GPR84, and S100A12. Using HP as a predictor of endoscopic disease activity, an
accuracy of 67.3% was observed, compared with 52.4%, 45.2%, and 30.3% for
C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and platelet count,
respectively. Finally, at 14 weeks of treatment, response to anti-TNF therapy
induced alterations in blood HP, CD177, GPR84, and S100A12 transcripts that
correlated with changes in endoscopic activity.
Conclusions: Transcriptional changes in UC patients are sensitive to endoscopic
improvement and appear to be an effective tool to monitor patients over time.

Pattern recognition receptors (PRR), such as NOD-like receptors (NLRs), sense
conserved microbial signatures, and host danger signals leading to the
coordination of appropriate immune responses. Upon activation, a subset of NLR
initiate the assembly of a multimeric protein complex known as the inflammasome, 
which processes pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediates a specialized form of
cell death known as pyroptosis. The identification of inflammasome-associated
genes as inflammatory bowel disease susceptibility genes implicates a role for
the inflammasome in intestinal inflammation. Despite the fact that the functional
importance of inflammasomes within immune cells has been well established, the
contribution of inflammasome expression in non-hematopoietic cells remains
comparatively understudied. Given that intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) act as a
barrier between the host and the intestinal microbiota, inflammasome expression
by these cells is likely important for intestinal immune homeostasis.
Accumulating evidence suggests that the inflammasome plays a key role in shaping 
epithelial responses at the host-lumen interface with many inflammasome
components highly expressed by IEC. Recent studies have exposed functional roles 
of IEC inflammasomes in mucosal immune defense, inflammation, and tumorigenesis. 
In this review, we present the main features of the predominant inflammasomes and
their effector mechanisms contributing to intestinal homeostasis and
inflammation. We also discuss existing controversies in the field and open
questions related to their implications in disease. A comprehensive understanding
of the molecular basis of intestinal inflammasome signaling could hold
therapeutic potential for clinical translation.

Gut microbiota forms a catalog of about 1000 bacterial species; which mainly
belong to the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla. Microbial genes are essential
for key metabolic processes; such as the biosynthesis of short-chain fatty acids 
(SCFA); amino acids; bile acids or vitamins. It is becoming clear that gut
microbiota is playing a prevalent role in pathologies such as metabolic syndrome;
type 2 diabetes (T2D); inflammatory and bowel diseases. Obesity and related
diseases; notably type 2 diabetes, induce gut dysbiosis. In this review; we aim
to cover the current knowledge about the effects of antidiabetic drugs on gut
microbiota diversity and composition as well as the potential beneficial effects 
mediated by specific taxa. Metformin is the first-line treatment against T2D. In 
addition to its glucose-lowering and insulin sensitizing effects, metformin
promotes SCFA-producing and mucin-degrading bacteria. Other antidiabetic drugs
discussed in this review show positive effects on dysbiosis; but without any
consensus specifically regarding the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. Thus,
beneficial effects might be mediated by specific taxa.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Altered gene expression in intestinal mucosa is thought to
contribute to inflammatory process in Crohn's disease (CD). The present study
investigated changes in the expression of genes associated with gut inflammation 
in CD patients by RNA microarray to identify disease biomarkers.
METHODS: Microarray analysis was carried out in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
intestinal tissue specimens from six CD patients who underwent surgery without
prior treatment and from two healthy control subjects. Transcripts overexpressed 
in CD patients were validated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using 
specimens from 46 CD patients and 60 healthy controls.
RESULTS: Among the genes over-expressed with statistical significance, five genes
including decay-accelerating factor, interleukin-1 receptor (IL1R) A, tumour
necrosis factor receptor 2, (C-X-C motif) ligand (CXCL) 1, and granzyme (GZM) B
proposed to have functional association with CD were selected to validate the
expressed transcripts in serum. Serum concentration of IL1RA, CXCL1, and GZMB
measured by ELISA were significantly higher in CD patients.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified that IL1RA, CXCL1, and GZMB are overexpressed in CD
patients. Serum IL1RA and GZMB levels were markedly increased in CD patients,
suggesting that these markers can serve as biomarkers to identify gut
inflammation. Further studies will be required to evaluate this possibility.

Background: Variations in intestinal antioxidant membrane transporters are
implicated in the initiation and progression of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
Facilitated glucose transporter member 14 (GLUT14), encoded by the solute carrier
family 2 member 14 (SLC2A14) gene, is a putative transporter for dehydroascorbic 
acid and glucose. Although information on the gene is limited, shorter and longer
GLUT14 isoforms have been identified. We hypothesized that GLUT14 mediates
glucose and dehydroascorbic acid uptake. If this function could be validated,
then genetic variations may associate with IBD.Objective: This study aimed to
determine the substrate(s) for the GLUT14 protein and interrogated genetic
associations of SLC2A14 with IBD.Design: The uptake of radiolabeled substrates
into Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing the 2 GLUT14 isoforms was assessed.
Examination of gene-targeted genetic association in the Manitoba Inflammatory
Bowel Disease Cohort Study was conducted through the genotyping of single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) representing linkage blocks of the SLC2A14
gene.Results: Both GLUT14 isoforms mediated the uptake of dehydroascorbic acid
and glucose into X. laevis oocytes. Three alleles in the SLC2A14 gene associated 
independently with IBD. The odds of having ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn
disease (CD) were elevated in carriers of the SLC2A14 SNP rs2889504-T allele (OR:
3.60; 95% CI: 1.95, 6.64 and OR: 4.68; 95% CI: 2.78, 8.50, respectively).
Similarly, the SNP rs10846086-G allele was associated with an increased risk of
both UC and CD (OR: 2.91; 95% CI: 1.49, 5.68 and OR: 3.00; 95% CI: 1.55, 5.78,
respectively). Moreover, the SNP rs12815313-T allele associated with increased
susceptibility to CD and UC (OR: 2.12; 95% CI: 1.33, 3.36 and OR: 1.61; 95% CI:
1.01, 2.57, respectively).Conclusion: These findings strengthen the hypothesis
that genetically determined local dysregulation of dietary vitamin C or
antioxidants transport contributes to IBD development. These transporter proteins
are targetable by dietary interventions, opening the avenue to a precision
intervention for patients of specific genotypes with IBD. This trial was
registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03262649.

BACKGROUND: Diet is suggested to participate in the etiology of inflammatory
bowel diseases (IBD). Repeated exposure to Maillard reaction products (MRPs),
molecules resulting from reduction reactions between amino acids and sugars
during food heating, has been reported to be either potentially detrimental or
beneficial to health.
AIMS: The aim of this study is to determine the effect of repeated oral ingestion
of N ε-carboxymethyllysine (CML), an advanced MRP, on the onset of two models of 
experimental IBD and on the gut microbiota composition of mice.
METHODS: Mice received either saline (control) or N ε-carboxymethyllysine daily
for 21 days. For the last week of treatment, each group was split into subgroups,
receiving dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS) or trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid
(TNBS) to induce colitis. Intensity of inflammation was quantified, and cecal
microbiota characterized by bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) amplicon
sequencing.
RESULTS: Daily oral administration of N ε-carboxymethyllysine did not induce
intestinal inflammation and had limited impact on gut microbiota composition
(Bacteroidaceae increase, Lachnospiraceae decrease). DSS and TNBS administration 
resulted in expected moderate experimental colitis with a shift of
Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio and a significant Proteobacteria increase but with
distinct profiles: different Proteobacteria taxa for DSS, but mainly
Enterobacteriaceae for TNBS. While N ε-carboxymethyllysine exposure failed to
prevent the inflammatory response, it allowed maintenance of healthy gut
microbiota profiles in mice treated with DSS (but not TNBS).
CONCLUSIONS: Repeated oral exposure to CML limits dysbiosis in experimental
colitis. IBD patients may modulate their microbiota profile by regulating the
level and type of dietary MRP consumption.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the world's most common cancers and is the
second leading cause of cancer deaths, causing more than 50,000 estimated deaths 
each year. Several risk factors are highly associated with CRC, including being
overweight, eating a diet high in red meat and over-processed meat, having a
history of inflammatory bowel disease, and smoking. Previous zebrafish studies
have demonstrated that multiple oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes can be
regulated through genetic or epigenetic alterations. Zebrafish research has also 
revealed that the activation of carcinogenesis-associated signal pathways plays
an important role in CRC. The biology of cancer, intestinal disorders caused by
carcinogens, and the morphological patterns of tumors have been found to be
highly similar between zebrafish and humans. Therefore, the zebrafish has become 
an important animal model for translational medical research. Several zebrafish
models have been developed to elucidate the characteristics of gastrointestinal
diseases. This review article focuses on zebrafish models that have been used to 
study human intestinal disorders and tumors, including models involving mutant
and transgenic fish. We also report on xenograft models and chemically-induced
enterocolitis. This review demonstrates that excellent zebrafish models can
provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal diseases and
help facilitate the evaluation of novel anti-tumor drugs.

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative
colitis, have important extraintestinal manifestations, notably in the oral
cavity. These oral manifestations can constitute important clinical clues in the 
diagnosis and management of IBD, and include changes at the immune and bacterial 
levels. Aphthous ulcers, pyostomatitis vegetans, cobblestoning and gingivitis are
important oral findings frequently observed in IBD patients. Their presentations 
vary considerably and might be well diagnosed and distinguished from other oral
lesions. Infections, drug side effects, deficiencies in some nutrients and many
other diseases involved with oral manifestations should also be taken into
account. This article discusses the most recent findings on the oral
manifestations of IBD with a focus on bacterial modulations and immune changes.
It also includes an overview on options for management of the oral lesions of
IBD.

Objectives Multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) encodes a protein called P-glycoprotein 
(P-gp), which serves as an efflux pump membrane protein implicated in intestinal 
homeostasis and drug resistance. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) is a key enzyme in the
synthesis of proinflammatory prostaglandins, tumourigenesis and in mucosal
defence. Despite the importance of MDR1 and COX2, changes in their mRNA levels
have not been studied in cats with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and low-grade
alimentary lymphoma (LGAL). The present study aimed to determine the mRNA levels 
of MDR1 and COX2 in cats with IBD and LGAL, and to evaluate their correlation
with clinical signs, histological severity and between genes. Methods Cats
diagnosed with IBD (n = 20) and LGAL (n = 9) between 2008 and 2015 were included 
in the current study. Three healthy animals composed the healthy control cats
group in which endoscopy was performed immediately before the ovariohysterectomy.
All duodenal biopsy samples were obtained by endoscopy. Feline chronic
enteropathy activity index was calculated for all cases. IBD histopathology was
classified according to severity. MDR1 and COX2 mRNA levels were determined by
absolute reverse transcriptase-quantitative real-time PCR. Results Statistically 
significant differences were observed for MDR1 and COX2 mRNA levels between the
IBD and LGAL groups. No correlations were observed between molecular gene
expression, feline chronic enteropathy activity index and histological grading
for IBD, and between MDR1 and COX2 genes. However, a positive statistically
significant correlation was observed between MDR1 and COX2 expression in the
duodenum of cats. Conclusions and relevance MDR1 and COX2 gene expression is
increased in cats with LGAL compared with cats with IBD. The control group tended
to have lower values than both diseased groups. These results suggest that these 
genes may be involved in the pathogenesis of IBD or LGAL in cats.

Long non‑coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to serve a crucial role in
renal diseases; however, their role in immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN)
remains unclear. In the present study, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
were collected from both patients with IgAN and healthy controls. A microarray
analysis was then performed to identify differentially expressed lncRNAs and
mRNAs in PBMCs, which were confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
In addition, Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
pathway and lncRNA‑mRNA co‑expression network analyses were conducted. The
present study identified 167 differentially expressed lncRNAs and 94
differentially expressed mRNAs. Numerous GO terms, including innate immune
response, inflammatory response, IPAF inflammasome complex and
UDP‑galactose:β‑N‑acetylglucosamine β‑1, and 3‑galactosyltransferase activity,
were significantly enriched in the differentially expressed mRNAs. The top five
KEGG signaling pathways included nucleotide‑binding oligomerization domain‑like
receptor signaling pathway, hematopoietic cell lineage, inflammatory bowel
disease, tumor necrosis factor signaling pathway and other types of O‑glycan
biosynthesis. In addition, a total of 149 lncRNAs were shown to interact with 7
mRNAs that were associated with the 'innate immune response' GO term. The results
of the present study demonstrated that differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs
may have a role in the development of IgAN. These results may aid in the
elucidation of a basic pathogenic mechanism, the identification of possible
biomarkers and the generation of potential novel treatment strategies for IgAN.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that is
associated with both genetic and environmental factors; however, the underlying
pathogenesis of UC remains unclear. The present study aimed to further explore
12 microarray datasets from patients with UC obtained from the Gene Expression
Omnibus repository, for potential genetic pathogenesis of UC through a global
bioinformatics view, which included identification of differentially expressed
genes (DEGs), functional enrichments, protein‑protein interactions,
transcriptional and post‑transcriptional regulation and drug‑gene associations.
This integrated analysis screened 233 DEGs that were compared between UC and
normal control tissue samples; these included 173 upregulated and
60 downregulated DEGs. Subsequently, transcription factors, such as TATA‑binding 
protein 1 (TBP1; hsa_TATAAA_V$TATA_01) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB;
hsa_V$NFKAPPAB_01) and microRNAs (miRNAs; such as miR‑516‑3p and miR‑23a) were
revealed to be associated with 233 DEGs. Notably, further analysis indicated that
these DEGs were enriched in certain diseases, including inflammation, fibrosis
and immune system diseases, and were also associated with some drugs, including
prednisone, collagenase and mycophenolate mofetil, which may provide choice for
treatment of UC. In conclusion, this study may provide novel insights into
discovering potential molecular targets involved in the pathogenesis and
treatment of UC.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) symbolizes a group of intestinal disorders in
which prolonged inflammation occur in the digestive tract (esophagus, large
intestine, small intestine mouth, stomach). Both genetic and environmental
factors (infections, stress, diet) are involved in the development of IBD. As we 
know that bacteria are found in the intestinal mucosa of human and clinical
observations revealed bacterial biofilms associated with patients of IBD. Various
factors and microbes are found to play an essential role in biofilm formation and
mucosal colonization during IBD. Biofilm formation in the digestive tract is
dependent on an extracellular matrix synthesized by the bacteria and it has an
adverse effect on the immune response of the host. There is no satisfactory and
safe treatment option for IBD. Therefore, the current research aims to disrupt
biofilm in IBD and concentrates predominantly on improving the drug. Here, we
review the literature on bacterial biofilm and IBD to gather new knowledge on the
current understanding of biofilm formation in IBD, host immune deregulation and
dysbiosis in IBD, molecular mechanism, bacteria involved in biofilm formation,
current and future regimen. It is urgently required to plan new ways to control
and eradicate bacteria in biofilms that will open up novel diagnostic and
therapeutic avenues for IBD. This article includes the mechanism of signaling
molecules with respect to the biofilm-related genes as well as the diagnostic
methods and new technologies involved in the treatment of IBD.

It has long been known that patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD) have an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). The innate
immune system of host cells provides a first-line defence against pathogenic
infection, whereas an uncontrolled inflammatory response under homeostatic
conditions usually leads to pathological consequences, as exemplified by the
chronic inflammation of IBD. The key molecules and pathways keeping innate
immunity in check are still poorly defined. Here, we report that the chromatin
remodeller polybromo-1 (PBRM1) is a repressor of innate immune signalling
mediated by retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs).
Knockdown of PBRM1 in colon cancer cells increased the expression of two receptor
genes (RIG-I and MDA5) and upregulated interferon (IFN)-related and
inflammation-related gene signatures. The innate immune signal stimulated by a
double-stranded RNA viral mimic was exaggerated by PBRM1 suppression. PBRM1
cooperated with polycomb protein EZH2 to directly bind the cis-regulatory
elements of RIG-I and MDA5, thereby suppressing their transcription. Moreover,
upregulation of RIG-I and MDA5 is required for IFN response activation induced by
PBRM1 silencing. TRIM25, a protein stimulated by the RLR pathway and IFN
production, physically interacted with PBRM1 and induced PBRM1 protein
destabilization by promoting its ubiquitination. These findings reveal a
PBRM1-RLR regulatory circuit that can keep innate immune activity at a minimal
level in resting cells, and also ensure a robust inflammatory response in the
case of pathogen invasion. PBRM1 was found to be downregulated in primary tissues
from patients with CRC or IBD, and its expression correlated negatively with that
of RLR genes and interferon-stimulated genes in CRC samples. Lower PBRM1
expression was associated with advanced pathological grade and poorer survival of
CRC patients, indicating that PBRM1 could serve as a potential prognostic
biomarker for CRC. Copyright © 2017 Pathological Society of Great Britain and

The gastrointestinal tract contains the largest lymphoid organ to react with
pathogenic microorganisms and suppress excess inflammation. Patients with primary
immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs) can suffer from refractory diarrhea. In this
study, we present two siblings who began to suffer from refractory diarrhea with 
a poor response to aggressive antibiotic and immunosuppressive treatment after
surgical release of neonatal intestinal obstruction. Their lymphocyte
proliferation was low, but superoxide production and IL-10 signaling were normal.
Candidate genetic approach targeted to genes involved in PIDs with inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD)-like manifestation was unrevealing. Whole-genome sequencing
revealed novel heterozygous mutations Glu75Lys and nucleotide 520-521 CT deletion
in the tetratricopeptide repeat domain 7A (TTC7A) gene. A Medline search
identified 49 patients with TTC7A mutations, of whom 20 survived. Their
phenotypes included both multiple intestinal atresia (MIA) and combined T and/or 
B immunodeficiency (CID) in 16, both IBD and CID in 14, isolated MIA in 8, MIA,
IBD, and CID complex in 8, and isolated IBD in 3. Of these 98 mutant alleles
over-through the coding region clustering on exon 2 (40 alleles), exon 7 (12
alleles), and exon 20 (10 alleles), 2 common hotspot mutations were c.211 G>A
(p.E71K in exon 2) in 26 alleles and AAGT deletion in exon 7 (+3) in 10 alleles. 
Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that those with biallelic missense mutations
(p = 0.0168), unaffected tetratricopeptide repeat domains (p = 0.0311), and
developing autoimmune disorders (p = 0.001) had a relatively better prognosis.
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) restored immunity and seemed to
decrease the frequency of infections; however, refractory diarrhea persisted.
Clinical improvement was reported upon intestinal and liver transplantation in a 
child with CID and MIA of unknown genetic etiology. In conclusion, patients with 
TTC7A mutations presenting with the very early onset of refractory diarrhea had
limit improvement by HSCT or/and tailored immunosuppressive therapy in the
absence of suitable intestine donors. We suggest that MIA-CID-IBD disorder caused
by TTC7A mutations should also be included in the PID classification of
"immunodeficiencies affecting cellular and humoral immunity" to allow for prompt 
recognition and optimal treatment.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative
colitis, is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. 
Currently, it is treated with immunosuppressant or biologics that often induce
severe adverse effects. Thus, there is an urgent clinical need for more specific 
treatments. To provide a valid therapeutic tool for IBD therapy, in this work we 
developed biomimetic nanovesicles by manipulating leukocyte membranes to exploit 
mechanisms of T-cell recruitment during inflammation. A subset of T-lymphocytes
participates in homing to inflamed tissue in the gastrointestinal tract by
overexpressing the α4β7 integrin, which is responsible for binding to its
receptor on the endothelial membrane, the mucosal addressin cell adhesion
molecule 1. Based on this principle, we engineered biomimetic vesicles, referred 
to as specialized leukosomes (SLKs), which are leukocyte-like carriers 'doped'
with the α4β7 integrin over-induced in purified immune cells. We tested SLKs in
an in vivo murine model of IBD induced by treatment with dextran sulfate sodium. 
Notably, treatment of IBD mice with SLKs allowed us to observe a reduction of
inflammation (favorable modulation of both pro- and anti-inflammatory genes, as
well as reduction of immune cells infiltration into the colon tissue), and a
consequent enhanced intestinal repair (low epithelial damage). In this study, we 
demonstrate that biological-derived nanoparticles can be used not only as
naturally targeted drug delivery systems, but also as nano-therapeutics endowed
with intrinsic anti-inflammatory properties.

BACKGROUND: In contrast to adult-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), where
many genetic loci have been shown to be involved in complex disease etiology,
early-onset IBD (eoIBD) and associated syndromes can sometimes present as
monogenic conditions. As a result, the clinical phenotype and ideal disease
management in these patients often differ from those in adult-onset IBD. However,
due to high costs and the complexity of data analysis, high-throughput screening 
for genetic causes has not yet become a standard part of the diagnostic work-up
of eoIBD patients.
METHODS: We selected 28 genes of interest associated with monogenic IBD and
performed targeted panel sequencing in 71 patients diagnosed with eoIBD or
early-onset chronic diarrhea to detect causative variants. We compared these
results to whole-exome sequencing (WES) data available for 25 of these patients.
RESULTS: Target coverage was significantly higher in the targeted gene panel
approach compared with WES, whereas the cost of the panel was considerably lower 
(approximately 25% of WES). Disease-causing variants affecting protein function
were identified in 5 patients (7%), located in genes of the IL10 signaling
pathway (3), WAS (1), and DKC1 (1). The functional effects of 8 candidate
variants in 5 additional patients (7%) are under further investigation. WES did
not identify additional causative mutations in 25 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Targeted gene panel sequencing is a fast and effective screening
method for monogenic causes of eoIBD that should be routinely established in
national referral centers.

PURPOSE: Ulcerative colitis (UC) as a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),
presumed to occur as a consequence of increased immune responses to intestinal
microbiota in genetically susceptible individuals. Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides
fragilis (ETBF) strains are important intestinal bacteria that can be involved in
IBD. The aim of this study was to design a quantitative assay for detection of B.
fragilis and ETBF and also to find their association with UC.
METHODS: Ninety-five biopsies were collected from patients with UC (n = 35) and
with no IBD (nIBD, n = 60). All the specimens were cultured in Bacteroides bile
esculin agar medium. Specific primers and probes were designed for quantitative
real-time PCR (QRT-PCR) based on 16S rRNA and bft genes sequences of ETBF.
RESULTS: The bft genes were detected in 51.4% of UC samples and 1.6% of nIBD
samples, respectively. In UC patients, 37.1% of samples with diarrhea and 11.4%
of samples without diarrhea, harbored the bft gene. Mean value of the number of
ETBF with bft gene in UC and nIBD samples were 4.46 ×Ÿ 102 and 1.96,
respectively. Likewise these result for 16S rRNA gene in UC and nIBD samples were
2.0 × 103 and 8.4 × 103, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant association between presence and numbers of
16S rRNA gene of B. fragilis and UC. ETBF was detected more in UC specimens and
biopsies of UC patients with diarrhea than in the control group. These data
demonstrated that ETBF is associated with development of UC and as a causative
agent for the development of diarrhea in these patients.

Background: Epidemiologic studies and animal model experiments have shown that
parasites have significant modulatory effects on autoimmune disorders, including 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Recombinant Sj16 (rSj16), a 16-kDa secreted
protein of Schistosoma japonicum (S.japonicum) produced by Escherichia coli (E.
coli), has been shown to have immunoregulatory effects in vivo and in vitro. In
this study, we aimed to determine the effects of rSj16 on dextran sulfate sodium 
(DSS)-induced colitis. Methods: DSS-induced colitis mice were treated with rSj16.
Body weight loss, disease activity index (DAI), myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity
levels, colon lengths, macroscopic scores, histopathology findings, inflammatory 
cytokine levels and regulatory T cell (Treg) subset levels were examined.
Moreover, the differential genes expression after treated with rSj16 were
sequenced, analyzed and identified. Results: rSj16 attenuated clinical activity
of DSS-induced colitis mice, diminished pro-inflammatory cytokine production,
up-regulated immunoregulatory cytokine production and increased Treg percentages 
in DSS-induced colitis mice. Moreover, DSS-induced colitis mice treated with
rSj16 displayed changes in the expression levels of specific genes in the colon
and show the crucial role of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α
(PPAR-α) signaling pathway. PPAR-α activation diminished the therapeutic effects 
of rSj16 in DSS-induced colitis mice, indicating that the PPAR-α signaling
pathway plays a crucial role in DSS-induced colitis development. Conclusions:
rSj16 has protective effects on DSS-induced colitis, effects mediated mainly by
PPAR-α signaling pathway inhibition. The findings of this study suggest that
rSj16 may be useful as a therapeutic agent and that PPAR-α may be a new
therapeutic target in the treatment of IBD.

BACKGROUND: Methionine, a central molecule in one-carbon metabolism, is an
essential amino acid required for normal growth and development. Despite its
importance to biological systems, methionine is toxic when administered at
supra-physiological levels. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects 
of short-term methionine dietary modulation on the proximal jejunum, the section 
of the gut specifically responsible for amino acid absorption, in a mouse model. 
Eight-week-old CBA/J male mice were fed methionine-adequate (MAD; 6.5 g/kg) or
methionine-supplemented (MSD; 19.5 g/kg) diets for 3.5 or 6 days (average food
intake 100 g/kg body weight). The study design was developed in order to address 
the short-term effects of the methionine supplementation that corresponds to
methionine dietary intake in Western populations. Biochemical indices in the
blood as well as metabolic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, metagenomic, and
histomorphological parameters in the gut were evaluated.
RESULTS: By day 6, feeding mice with MSD (protein intake <10% different from MAD)
resulted in increased plasma (2.3-fold; p < 0.054), but decreased proximal
jejunum methionine concentrations (2.2-fold; p < 0.05) independently of the
expression of neutral amino acid transporters. MSD has also caused small bowel
bacteria colonization, increased the abundance of pathogenic bacterial species
Burkholderiales and decreased the gene expression of the intestinal transmembrane
proteins-Cldn8 (0.18-fold, p < 0.05), Cldn9 (0.24-fold, p < 0.01) and Cldn10
(0.05-fold, p < 0.05). Feeding MSD led to substantial histomorphological
alterations in the proximal jejunum exhibited as a trend towards decreased plasma
citrulline concentrations (1.8-fold, p < 0.07), as well as loss of crypt depth
(by 28%, p < 0.05) and mucosal surface (by 20%, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Together, these changes indicate that short-term feeding of MSD
substantially alters the normal gut physiology. These effects may contribute to
the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammatory diseases and/or sensitize the gut to 
exposure to other stressors.

Type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) both contribute to mucosal homeostasis and
initiate pathologic inflammation in allergic asthma. However, the signals that
direct ILC2s to promote homeostasis versus inflammation are unclear. To identify 
such molecular cues, we profiled mouse lung-resident ILCs using single-cell RNA
sequencing at steady state and after in vivo stimulation with the alarmin
cytokines IL-25 and IL-33. ILC2s were transcriptionally heterogeneous after
activation, with subpopulations distinguished by expression of proliferative,
homeostatic and effector genes. The neuropeptide receptor Nmur1 was
preferentially expressed by ILC2s at steady state and after IL-25 stimulation.
Neuromedin U (NMU), the ligand of NMUR1, activated ILC2s in vitro, and in vivo
co-administration of NMU with IL-25 strongly amplified allergic inflammation.
Loss of NMU-NMUR1 signalling reduced ILC2 frequency and effector function, and
altered transcriptional programs following allergen challenge in vivo. Thus,
NMUR1 signalling promotes inflammatory ILC2 responses, highlighting the
importance of neuro-immune crosstalk in allergic inflammation at mucosal
surfaces.

BACKGROUND: Tight crosstalk between the circadian and immune systems has been
reported in several inflammatory diseases. We hypothesized that circadian
timekeeping was perturbed in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and that the
bidirectional regulation of circadian disturbance and inflammation may be
involved in the pathogenesis of IBD.
METHODS: Patients with ulcerative colitis (51) and Crohn's disease (39) and 42
healthy controls were recruited and their circadian gene expression levels
evaluated. Dextran sodium sulfate/2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid
(TNBS)-induced colitis mouse models, and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated
macrophages, were examined to detect the influence of inflammation on circadian
gene expression, both in vivo and in vitro. Light/dark shift and time-restricted 
feeding models were also used to evaluate the influence of circadian disturbance 
on a mouse colitis model.
RESULTS: We found that (1) almost all circadian genes were reduced in both
intestinal biopsies and the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with
IBD, especially in patients with ulcerative colitis. Nearly all circadian genes
of biopsy tissues showed negative correlations with a Mayo score or a simplified 
endoscopic activity score for Crohn's disease. Circadian genes of peripheral
blood mononuclear cells correlated well with erythrocyte sedimentation rate and
C-reactive protein levels in IBD. (2) Exposure to dextran sodium
sulfate/2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid and lipopolysaccharide-induced marked
changes in circadian gene expression profiles. (3) A phase shift exacerbated
colitis in mice, with the increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and
activation of inflammatory-related signaling pathways.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that inflammation and circadian genes showed
complex bidirectional regulations that were relevant to IBD. Consequently, the
circadian clock seems to be a potential target for IBD therapy.

There is an increasing understanding on the etiology of chronic immune-mediated
inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), psoriasis, or
rheumatoid arthritis. Large consortia contributed to the elucidation of the
genetics, for instance, of IBD identifying a number of genes involved in innate
mucosal defense and immune tolerance (most prominent, e.g., NOD2) and other
related processes. For a number of such diseases, common genetic susceptibility
loci were identified, suggesting overlapping immune response pathways, although
there is no causality of single genetic traits.2 In particular, the elucidation
of main triggers of inflammation like tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα),
integrins, specific cytokines like interleukin (IL)-6 or IL-23 launched the
successful development of new pharmacological approaches, leading to a tremendous
improvement of therapeutic outcomes.

A major challenge in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is the integration of
diverse IBD data sets to construct predictive models of IBD. We present a
predictive model of the immune component of IBD that informs causal relationships
among loci previously linked to IBD through genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) using functional and regulatory annotations that relate to the cells,
tissues, and pathophysiology of IBD. Our model consists of individual networks
constructed using molecular data generated from intestinal samples isolated from 
three populations of patients with IBD at different stages of disease. We
performed key driver analysis to identify genes predicted to modulate network
regulatory states associated with IBD, prioritizing and prospectively validating 
12 of the top key drivers experimentally. This validated key driver set not only 
introduces new regulators of processes central to IBD but also provides the
integrated circuits of genetic, molecular, and clinical traits that can be
directly queried to interrogate and refine the regulatory framework defining IBD.

Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs)
with high prevalence in humans. Carnosic acid (CA) has been reported to possess
antioxidative properties; however, its role in IBDs has not been determined. In
the present study, we found that CA significantly prevented the loss of body
weight and shortening of colon length in acute colitis induced by dextran sodium 
sulfate (DSS). Pronounced infiltration of immune cells and a loss of crypt
architecture and goblet cells were ameliorated by CA. CA significantly decreased 
the activity of MPO and infiltration of F4/80+ macrophages in the colon.
DSS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA and protein levels in the colon were
also attenuated by CA. CA decreased the activation of p65 and c-Jun signalling.
CA inhibited DSS-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation by reducing caspase 1
activity. In addition, CA increased the level of Nrf2 and prevented the
degradation of Nrf2 via ubiquitination by blocking the interaction between
Cullin3 and Keap1, which resulted in the decrease of Nrf2 target genes. Finally, 
GSH levels and SOD activity were increased after CA treatment, while MDA and iNOS
levels were significantly reduced. Taken together, our data showed that CA may be
useful as a potential therapeutic candidate for IBDs.

BACKGROUND: Intestinal barrier defects are common in patients with inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD). To identify which components could underlie these changes,
we performed an in-depth analysis of epithelial barrier genes in IBD.
METHODS: A set of 128 intestinal barrier genes was selected. Polygenic risk
scores were generated based on selected barrier gene variants that were
associated with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) in our study.
Gene expression was analyzed using microarray and quantitative reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction. Influence of barrier gene variants on
expression was studied by cis-expression quantitative trait loci mapping and
comparing patients with low- and high-risk scores.
RESULTS: Barrier risk scores were significantly higher in patients with IBD than 
controls. At single-gene level, the associated barrier single-nucleotide
polymorphisms were most significantly enriched in PTGER4 for CD and HNF4A for UC.
As a group, the regulating proteins were most enriched for CD and UC. Expression 
analysis showed that many epithelial barrier genes were significantly
dysregulated in active CD and UC, with overrepresentation of mucus layer genes.
In uninflamed CD ileum and IBD colon, most barrier gene levels restored to
normal, except for MUC1 and MUC4 that remained persistently increased compared
with controls. Expression levels did not depend on cis-regulatory variants nor
combined genetic risk.
CONCLUSIONS: We found genetic and transcriptomic dysregulations of key epithelial
barrier genes and components in IBD. Of these, we believe that mucus genes, in
particular MUC1 and MUC4, play an essential role in the pathogenesis of IBD and
could represent interesting targets for treatment.

Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 3 (NHE3) plays a key role in coupled electroneutral NaCl
absorption in the mammalian intestine. Reduced NHE3 expression or function has
been implicated in the pathogenesis of diarrhea associated with inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD) or enteric infections. Our previous studies revealed
transcriptional regulation of NHE3 by various agents such as TNF-α, IFN-γ, and
butyrate involving transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3. In silico analysis revealed
that the NHE3 core promoter also contains a hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF-4α)
binding site that is evolutionarily conserved in several species suggesting that 
HNF-4α has a role in NHE3 regulation. Nhe3 mRNA levels were reduced in
intestine-specific Hnf4α-null mice. However, detailed mechanisms of NHE3
regulation by HNF-4α are not known. We investigated the regulation of NHE3 gene
expression by HNF-4α in vitro in the human intestinal epithelial cell line C2BBe1
and in vivo in intestine-specific Hnf4α-null ( Hnf4αΔIEpC) and control (
Hnf4αfl/fl) mice. HNF-4α knockdown by short interfering RNA in C2BBe1 cells
significantly decreased NHE3 mRNA and NHE3 protein levels. Gel mobility shift and
chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that HNF-4α directly interacts with
the HNF-4α motif in the NHE3 core promoter. Site-specific mutagenesis on the
HNF-4α motif decreased, whereas ectopic overexpression of HNF-4α increased, NHE3 
promoter activity. Furthermore, loss of HNF-4α in Hnf4αΔIEpC mice decreased
colonic Nhe3 mRNA and NHE3 protein levels. Our results demonstrate a novel role
for HNF-4α in basal regulation of NHE3 expression. These studies represent an
important and novel target for therapeutic intervention in IBD-associated
diarrhea. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Our studies for the first time show that hepatocyte
nuclear factor 4α directly regulates NHE3 promoter activity and its basal
expression in the intestine.

BACKGROUND: Changes in cytokine expression have been frequently found in patients
with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Cytokine values outside the normal range
may be somewhat related to common polymorphisms within cytokine genes.
OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to investigate the possible association
between polymorphisms within Interleukin IL-4 and IL-10 genes and susceptibility 
to and clinical features of IBD.
METHODS: The study population was composed of 140 healthy controls and 75
patients with IBD (40 patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and 35 patients with
ulcerative colitis (UC)). Genotyping was performed using polymerase chain
reaction with sequence-specific primers.
RESULTS: Higher frequencies for the C allele of IL-4-590 polymorphism
(P < 0.0001; odds ratio [OR], 5.68; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 3.28-9.83) 
and for the T allele of IL-4-1098 polymorphism (P = 0.016; OR, 1.83; 95% CI,
1.11-3.02) were observed in the whole group of IBD patients. The IL-4-590 C
allele was also significantly overrepresented when IBD patients were subdivided
into CD and UC (P < 0.0001; OR, 5.2-6.28). While the IL-4-1098 T allele was
present at higher frequencies in patients with UC (P = 0.05; OR, 1.95), but not
in CD (P = 0.09). Multiple pairwise comparisons indicated that genotypes of all
polymorphisms investigated within IL-4 gene are correlated with IBD, CD, and UC. 
Haplotype analysis showed that the IL-4-1098/-590 TC haplotype might predispose
individuals to IBD, CD, and UC whereas the IL-4-1098/-590 TT and GC haplotypes
have a protective effect. On the contrary, neither allele nor genotype
frequencies of IL-10 polymorphisms (IL-10-1082 A > G, IL-10-592 A > C, and
IL-10-819 T > C) were associated with IBD, CD, or UC.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that IL-4 polymorphisms might play a role
in susceptibility to IBD and its major subtypes in the Iranian population.

BACKGROUND: Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) are at risk of UC-associated
colorectal cancer (CRC); however, little is known about genetic alterations
occurring during UC carcinogenesis. We examined mutational changes in patients
with colitic cancer and the features that differed between the carcinogenesis of 
UC and sporadic CRC.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Specimens were obtained from the non-neoplastic mucosa and 
cancer cells of 12 patients with colitic cancer. The mutational rate of oncogenes
in colitic cancer was analyzed and compared to that of oncogenes in sporadic CRC.
RESULTS: We observed a lower mutation rate in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)
(16.7%(2/12) vs. 75.9%(161/212), respectively, p=0.0001) and KRAS (16.7%(2/12)
vs. 42% (89/212), respectively, p=0.04) in colitic cancer than in sporadic CRC.
With respect to cadherin 1 (CDH1) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 2
(FGFR2), the mutational rates for non-neoplastic colorectal mucosa were similar
to those in sporadic CRC.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that mutational rates for APC and KRAS differ between
colitic cancer and sporadic CRC. Furthermore, we revealed that CDH1 and FGFR2
become mutated at an earlier stage in colitic carcinogenesis than in sporadic
CRC.

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are multifactorial autoimmune diseases with
growing prevalence but the interaction between genetic, environmental and
immunologic factors in their development is complex and remains obscure. There is
great need to understand their pathogenetic mechanisms and evolve diagnostic and 
therapeutic tools. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are RNA molecules longer than
200 nucleotides that are known to interfere in gene regulation but their roles
and functions have not yet been fully understood. While they are widely
investigated in cancers, little is known about their contribution in other
diseases. There is growing evidence that lncRNAs play critical role in regulation
of immune system and that they interfere in the pathogenetic mechanisms of
autoimmune diseases, like IBDs. Recent studies have identified lncRNAs in the
proximity of IBD-associated genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms within
IBD-associated lncRNAs as well. Furthermore, blood samples and pinch biopsies
were also analyzed and a plethora of lncRNAs are found to be deregulated in
Crohn's disease (CD), Ulcerative colitis (UC) or both. (Especially in UC samples 
the lncRNAs INFG-AS1 and BC012900 were found to be significantly up-regulated.
Similarly, ANRIL, a lncRNA that nest different disease associated SNPs, is
significantly down-regulated in inflamed IBD tissue.) This review aims at
recording for the first time recent data about lncRNAs found to be deregulated in
IBDs and discussing suggestive pathogenetic mechanisms and future use of lncRNAs 
as biomarkers.

BACKGROUND & AIM: Comparing to adult inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), those with
early onset manifestations have different features in terms of the underlying
molecular pathology, the course of disease and the response to therapy. We
investigated the IL-10 signaling pathway previously reported as an important
cause of infantile (Very Early Onset) IBD to find any possible variants.
METHOD: With the next generation sequencing technique we screened IL-10, IL-10RA 
and IL10RB genes of 15 children affected by very early onset-GI
(gastrointestinal) disorders. Additionally, we analyzed them based on Thermo
Fisher immune deficiency panel for genes either having a known role in IBD
pathogenesis or cause the disorders with overlapping manifestations. We performed
multiple functional analyses only for the cases showing variants in IL-10-
related genes.
RESULT: In 3 out of 15 patients we identified variants including a homozygous and
heterozygote mutations in IL-10RA and a novel homozygous mutation in IL-12RB1.
Our functional studies reveal that in contrast to the IL-10RA heterozygote
mutation that does not have deleterious effects, the homozygous mutation
abrogates the IL-10 signaling pathway.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests we need to modify the classical diagnostic
approach from functional assays followed by candidate- gene or genes sequencing
to the firstly parallel genomic screening followed by functional studies.

Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at an increased risk of
developing colorectal cancer (CRC). The risk factors of CRC in IBD patients
include long disease duration, extensive colitis, severe histological
inflammation, and coexistence with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Several 
molecular pathways that contribute to sporadic CRC are also involved in the
pathogenesis of colitis-associated CRC. It is well established that long-standing
chronic inflammation is a key predisposing factor of CRC in IBD. Proinflammatory 
pathways, including nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), IL-6/STAT3, cyclooxygenase-2 
(COX-2)/PGE2, and IL-23/Th17, promote tumorigenesis by inducing the production of
inflammatory mediators, upregulating the expression of antiapoptotic genes, and
stimulating cell proliferation as well as angiogenesis. Better understanding of
the underlying mechanisms may provide some promising targets for prevention and
therapy. This review aims to elucidate the role of these signaling pathways in
the pathogenesis of colitis-associated CRC using evidence-based approaches.

attenuated colitis in interleukin (IL)‑10 knockout (IL‑10‑/‑) mice. In the
present study, metagenome sequencing was performed to investigate the gut
microbiome in IL‑10‑/‑mice and the influence of oral administration of LP on
microbial composition. Metagenomics sequencing was performed to investigate the
influence of IBD on the gut microbiome with and without LP treatment. The
alteration of the abundances of various taxonomic and functional groups were
investigated across these gut microbiomes. The present study demonstrates that
Akkermansia muciniphila was significantly enriched in IL‑10‑/‑ mice, and
bacteroides were significantly increased following LP administration. In
addition, the phylum Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were significantly influenced
by LP administration. Further characterization of functional capacity revealed
that in the gut metagenomes of IL‑10‑/‑mice, genes encoding cell cycle control,
replication, recombination, repair and cell envelope biogenesis were decreased,
but intracellular trafficking, secretion, and vesicular transport were increased.
The present findings indicate that the gut metagenome is associated with IBD, and
oral administration of LP contributes to prevention of gut inflammation,
providing insight into the treatment of IBD.

AIM: To investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms in maf protein K
(MAFK), which encodes the MAFK, lead to increased susceptibility to ulcerative
colitis in the Japanese population.
METHODS: This case control study examined the associations between MAFK single
nucleotide polymorphisms (rs4268033 G>A, rs3735656 T>C and rs10226620 C>T) and
ulcerative colitis susceptibility in 174 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC)
cases, and 748 subjects without no lower abdominal symptoms, diarrhea or
hematochezia (controls). In addition, as the second controls, we set 360
subjects, who have an irregular bowel movement without abnormal lower endoscopic 
findings (IBM controls).
RESULTS: The genotype frequency of rs4268033 AA and allelic frequency of the
rs4268033A allele were significantly higher in the UC cases than in both controls
(P = 0.0005 and < 0.0001, P = 0.015 and 0.0027 vs controls and IBM controls,
respectively). Logistic regression analysis after adjustment for age and gender
showed that the rs4268033 AA and rs3735656 CC genotypes were significantly
associated with susceptibility to UC development (OR = 2.63, 95%CI: 1.61-4.30, P 
= 0.0001 and OR = 1.81; 95%CI: 1.12-2.94, P = 0.015, respectively). Similar
findings were observed by the comparison with IBM controls. In addition, the
rs4268033 AA genotype was significantly associated with all phenotypes of UC
except early onset. There was no significant association between rs10226620 and
ulcerative colitis.
CONCLUSION: Our results provide the first evidence that MAFK genetic
polymorphisms are significantly associated with susceptibility to UC development.
In particular, rs4268033 is closely associated with an increased risk for the
development of UC.

AIM: To investigate the miRNA expression in colonic mucosal biopsies from
endoscopically inflamed and non inflamed regions of ulcerative colitis (UC)
patients.
METHODS: Colonic mucosal pinch biopsies were analyzed from the inflamed and non
inflamed regions of same UC patient. Total RNA was isolated and differential
miRNA profiling was done using microarray platform. Quantitative Real Time PCR
was performed in colonic biopsies from inflamed (n = 8) and non-inflamed (n = 8) 
regions of UC and controls (n = 8) to validate the differential expression of
miRNA. Potential targets of dysregulated miRNA were identified by using in silico
prediction tools and probable role of these miRNA in inflammatory pathways were
predicted.
RESULTS: The miRNA profile of inflamed colonic mucosa differs significantly from 
the non-inflamed. Real time PCR analysis showed that some of the miRNA were
differentially expressed in the inflamed mucosa as compared to non inflamed
mucosa and controls (miR-125b, miR-223, miR-138, and miR-155), while (miR-200a)
did not show any significant changes. In contrast to microarray, where miR-378d
showed downregulation in the inflamed mucosa, qRT-PCR showed a significant
upregulation in the inflamed mucosa as compared to the non inflamed. The in
silico prediction analysis revealed that the genes targeted by these miRNAs play 
role in the major signaling pathways like MAPK pathway, NF-κB signaling pathway, 
cell adhesion molecules which are all assciated with UC.
CONCLUSION: The present study reports disease specific alteration in the
expression of miR-125b, miR-155, miR-223 and miR-138 in UC patients and also
predict their biological significance.

Since the discovery of the first Crohn's disease (CD) gene NOD2 in 2001, 140
genetic loci have been found in whites using high-throughput genome-wide
association studies. Several genes influence the CD subphenotypes and treatment
response. With the observations of increasing prevalence in Asia and developing
countries and the incomplete explanation of CD variance, other underexplored
areas need to be integrated through novel methodologies. Algorithms that
incorporate specific genetic risk alleles with other biomarkers will be developed
and used to predict CD disease course, complications, and response to specific
therapies, allowing precision medicine to become real in CD.

Complement C4 genes are linked to paediatric inflammatory bowel disease (PIBD),
but the mechanisms have remained unclear. We examined the influence of C4B gene
number on intestinal microbiota and in-vitro serum complement activation by
intestinal microbes in PIBD patients. Complement C4A and C4B gene numbers were
determined by genomic reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
from 64 patients with PIBD (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis). The severity 
of the disease course was determined from faecal calprotectin levels. Intestinal 
microbiota was assessed using the HITChip microarray. Complement reactivity in
patients was analysed by incubating their sera with Yersinia pseudotuberculosis
and Akkermansia muciniphila and determining the levels of C3a and soluble
terminal complement complex (SC5b-9) using enzyme immunoassays. The microbiota
diversity was wider in patients with no C4B genes than in those with one or two
C4B genes, irrespective of intestinal inflammation. C4B and total C4 gene numbers
correlated positively with soluble terminal complement complex (TCC, SC5b-9)
levels when patient serum samples were stimulated with bacteria. Our results
suggest that the C4B gene number associates positively with inflammation in
patients with PIBD. Multiple copies of the C4B gene may thus aggravate the
IBD-associated dysbiosis through escalated complement reactivity towards the
microbiota.

The term inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) refers principally to two major
categories of chronic relapsing inflammatory intestinal disorders: Crohn's
disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). In the United States, it is currently
estimated that about 1.5 million people suffer from IBD, causing considerable
suffering, mortality and economic loss every year. Yet the cause of IBD is
unknown, and until we understand more, prevention or cure will not be possible.
There is a lot of variation in the incidence and prevalence of CD based on
geographic region, environment, immigrant population, and ethnic groups. The
annual incidence of CD in North America is reported to be 3.1-20.2 per 100,000
with a prevalence of 201 per 100,000 population. Based on the epidemiological,
genetic and immunological data, CD is considered to be a heterogeneous disorder
with multifactorial etiology in which genetics and environment interact to
manifest the disease. Several genes have been studied so for with respect to CD, 
but thus far the strong and replicated associations have been identified with
NOD2, IL23R and ATG16L1 genes. The risk factors implicated with CD include
smoking, low fiber- high carbohydrate diet, altered microbiome and medications
such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. CD is typically characterized by
transmural inflammation of the intestine and could affect any part of the
gastrointestinal tract from mouth to perianal area. In terms of distribution of
the disease 25% of the patients have colitis only, 25% is ileitis only and 50%
have ileocolitis. The Montreal classification is based on the age at diagnosis
(<16, 17-40, > 40), disease location (Ileal, colonic, Ileocolonic) and the
disease behavior (nonstricturing/nonpenetrating, stricturing, penetrating). The
key features for diagnosing CD comprises a combination of radiographic,
endoscopic and pathological findings demonstrating focal, asymmetric, transmural 
or granulomatous features. Abdominal Computed tomography (CT) enterography is the
most preferred first-line radiologic study used in the assessment of small bowel 
CD. The diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance enterography/enteroclysis is
similar to that of CT scans and also prevents exposure to ionizing radiation.
Endoscopic scores are considered to be the gold standard tool to measure the
activity of CD and they are used more commonly in the clinical trials to measure 
the efficacy of various drugs on inducing and maintaining mucosal healing. The
most common scoring systems used to measure clinical disease activity include
Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI), HBI- Harvey-Bradshaw index (HBI), short
inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (SIBDQ) and Lehmann score. Management of
Crohn's disease has been seen as an evolving challenge owing to its widely
heterogeneous manifestations, overlapping characteristics with other inflammatory
disorders, often elusive extraintestinal manifestations and uncertain etiology.
Therapeutic interventions are tailored to address symptomatic response and
subsequent tolerance of the intervention. Chronology of treatment should favor
treatment dose acute disease or "induction therapy", followed by maintenance of
adequate response or remission, i.e. "maintenance therapy". The medications which
are highly effective in inducing remission include steroids and Tumor Necrosis
Factor (TNF) inhibitors. Medications used to maintain remission include
5-aminosalicyclic acid products, immunomodulators (Azathioprine,
6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate) and TNF inhibitors (infliximab, adalimumab,
certolizumab and golimumab). Surgical interventions like bowel resection,
stricturoplasty or drainage of abscess is required in up to two thirds of CD
patients during their lifetime. The most common indications for surgical
resection are medically refractory disease, perforation, persisting or recurrent 
obstruction, abscess not amenable to percutaneous drainage, intractable
hemorrhage, dysplasia or cancer. Endoscopic recurrence in postoperative CD
patients, as defined by Rutgeers score i2-i4 occur in 30-90% of the patients at
the neoterminal ileum within 12 months of surgery and almost universally by 5
years. Treating CD requires a comprehensive care team including the patient,
primary care provider, and gastroenterologist. In summary CD is a chronic
inflammatory condition with a remitting and relapsing course primarily affecting 
relatively younger population with significant socioeconomic effects.

Chromosome 17q21 Genes ORMDL3 and GSDMB in Asthma and Immune Diseases.

Chromosome 17q21 contains a cluster of genes including ORMDL3 and GSDMB, which
have been highly linked to asthma in genome-wide association studies. ORMDL3 is
localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and regulates downstream pathways
including sphingolipids, metalloproteases, remodeling genes, and chemokines.
ORMDL3 inhibits serine palmitoyl-CoA transferase, the rate-limiting enzyme for
sphingolipid biosynthesis. In addition, ORMDL3 activates the ATF6α branch of the 
unfolded protein response which regulates SERCA2b and IL-6, pathways of potential
importance to asthma. The SNP-linking chromosome 17q21 to asthma is associated
with increased ORMDL3 and GSDMB expression. Mice expressing either increased
levels of human ORMDL3, or human GSDMB, have an asthma phenotype characterized by
increased airway responsiveness and increased airway remodeling (increased smooth
muscle and fibrosis) in the absence of airway inflammation. GSDMB regulates
expression of 5-LO and TGF-β1 which are known pathways involved in the
pathogenesis of asthma. GSDMB is one of four members of the GSDM family (GSDMA,
GSDMB, GSDMC, and GSDMD). GSDMD (located on chromosome 8q24 and not linked to
asthma) has emerged as a key mediator of pyroptosis. GSDMD is a key component of 
the NLPR3 inflammasome and is required for its activation. GSDMD undergoes
proteolytic cleavage by caspase-1 to release its N-terminal fragment, which in
turn mediates pyroptosis and IL-1β secretion. Chromosome 17q21 has not only been 
linked to asthma but also to type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and
primary biliary cirrhosis suggesting that future insights into the biology of
genes located in this region will increase our understanding of these diseases.

BACKGROUND: Campylobacter concisus and C. ureolyticus have emerged in recent
years as being associated with acute and prolonged gastroenteritis and implicated
in the development of inflammatory bowel diseases. However, there are limited
data on the prevalence of these microorganisms in Southeast Asia. In this study, 
214 pathogen-negative stool samples after laboratory examination for common
enteric pathogens to include C. jejuni and C. coli by culture from two
case-control traveler's diarrhea (TD) studies conducted in Thailand (cases = 26; 
controls = 30) and Nepal (cases = 83; controls = 75) respectively were assayed by
PCR for the detection of Campylobacter 16S rRNA and two specific heat shock
protein genes specific for C. concisus (cpn60) and C. ureolyticus (Hsp60)
respectively.
RESULTS: Campylobacter 16S rRNA was detected in 28.5% (61/214) of the
pathogen-negative TD stool samples (CIWEC Travel Medicine Clinic, Kathmandu,
Nepal: cases = 36, control = 14; Bamrungrad International Hospital, Bangkok,
Thailand: cases = 9, controls = 2). C. consisus was identified significantly more
often in TD cases in Nepal (28.9%; 24/83) as compared to controls (4%; 3/75)
(OR = 9.76; 95% CI 2.80-34.02; P = 0.0003) while C. consisus was detected in only
two cases (2/26; 7.7%) and none of the controls stool samples from Thailand. C.
ureolyticus was detected in four cases (4.8%; 4/83) and four controls (5.3%;
4/75) and in one case (3.8%; 1/26) and one control (3.1%; 1/30) from Nepal and
Thailand respectively. C. jejuni and C. coli were isolated in 18.3 and 3.4% of
the cases and in 4.0 and 1.4% of the controls in stool samples from both Thailand
and Nepal respectively while C. concisus nor C. ureolyticus were not tested for
in these samples.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that C. concisus potentially is a pathogen
associated with TD in Nepal. To our knowledge, this is the first report of C.
concisus and C. ureolyticus detected from traveler's diarrhea cases from
travelers to Nepal and Thailand.

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which include Crohn's disease and ulcerative
colitis, are chronic inflammatory disorders that can affect the whole
gastrointestinal tract or the colonic mucosal layer. Current therapies aiming to 
suppress the exaggerated immune response in IBD largely rely on compounds with
non-satisfying effects or side-effects. Therefore, new therapeutical options are 
needed. In the present study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of
the fungal metabolites, galiellalactone, and dehydrocurvularin in both an in
vitro intestinal inflammation model, as well as in isolated myenteric plexus and 
enterocyte cells. Administration of a pro-inflammatory cytokine mix through the
mesenteric artery of intestinal segments caused an up-regulation of inflammatory 
marker genes. Treatment of the murine intestinal segments with galiellalactone or
dehydrocurvularin by application through the mesenteric artery significantly
prevented the expression of pro-inflammatory marker genes on the mRNA and the
protein level. Comparable to the results in the perfused intestine model,
treatment of primary enteric nervous system (ENS) cells from the murine intestine
with the fungal compounds reduced expression of cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-α,
IL-1β, and inflammatory enzymes such as COX-2 and iNOS on mRNA and protein
levels. Similar anti-inflammatory effects of the fungal metabolites were observed
in the human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line DLD-1 after stimulation with
IFN-γ (10 ng/ml), TNF-α (10 ng/ml), and IL-1β (5 ng/ml). Our results show that
the mesenterially perfused intestine model provides a reliable tool for the
screening of new therapeutics with limited amounts of test compounds.
Furthermore, we could characterize the anti-inflammatory effects of two novel
active compounds, galiellalactone, and dehydrocurvularin which are interesting
candidates for studies with chronic animal models of IBD.

Campylobacter concisus was previously shown to be associated with inflammatory
bowel disease including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). C.
concisus has two genomospecies (GS). This study systematically examined the
colonization of GS1 and GS2 C. concisus in the human gastrointestinal tract. GS1 
and GS2 specific polymorphisms in 23S rRNA gene were identified by comparison of 
the 23S rRNA genes of 49 C. concisus strains. Two newly designed PCR methods,
based on the polymorphisms of 23S rRNA gene, were developed and validated. These 
PCR methods were used to detect and quantify GS1 and GS2 C. concisus in 56 oral
and enteric samples collected from the gastrointestinal tract of patients with
IBD and healthy controls. Meta-analysis of the composition of the isolated GS1
and GS2 C. concisus strains in previous studies was also conducted. The
quantitative PCR methods revealed that there was more GS2 than GS1 C. concisus in
samples collected from the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract of both
patients with IBD and healthy controls, showing that GS2 C. concisus is better
adapted to the human gastrointestinal tract. Analysis of GS1 and GS2 composition 
of isolated C. concisus strains in previous studies showed similar findings
except that in healthy individuals a significantly lower GS2 than GS1 C. concisus
strains were isolated from fecal samples, suggesting a potential difference in
the C. concisus strains or the enteric environment between patients with
gastrointestinal diseases and healthy controls. This study provides novel
information regarding the adaptation of different genomospecies of C. concisus in
the human gastrointestinal tract.

Taxonomic and functional changes to the composition of the gut microbiome have
been implicated in multiple human diseases. Recent microbiome genome-wide
association studies reveal that variants in many human genes involved in immunity
and gut architecture are associated with an altered composition of the gut
microbiome. Although many factors can affect the microbial organisms residing in 
the gut, a number of recent findings support the hypothesis that certain host
genetic variants predispose an individual towards microbiome dysbiosis. This
condition, in which the normal microbiome population structure is disturbed, is a
key feature in disorders of metabolism and immunity.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Diarrhea associated with inflammatory bowel diseases has been 
associated with increased levels of inflammatory cytokines, including tumor
necrosis factor (TNF). The intestinal mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel 
diseases has reduced expression of solute carrier family 26 member 3 (SLC26A3,
also called DRA). We investigated whether TNF directly affects expression of DRA 
in human intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and in the intestines of mice, and
studied the mechanisms of these effects.
METHODS: We performed quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction, immunofluorescence, and immunoblot analyses in Caco-2, HT-29, and T-84 
cells human IECs cultured in 2 or 3 dimensions with or without TNF (50 ng/mL for 
6-24 hours). We purified nuclear extracts and quantified nuclear factor-κB
(NF-κB) activation and DNA binding. We isolated intestinal crypts from C57BL/6
mice, cultured enteroids, incubated these with TNF (50 ng/mL, 24 hours), and
quantified messenger RNAs. DRA-mediated exchange of Cl- for HCO3- was measured by
uptake of 125I. Expression of the NF-κB inhibitor α (IkBa) was knocked down in
Caco-2 cells with small interfering RNAs. Activation of NF-κB in response to TNF 
was measured by luciferase reporter assays; binding of the NF-κB subunit p65 in
cells was analyzed in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. DRA promoter activity
was measured in a luciferase reporter assay. C57BL/6 mice were injected with TNF 
(5 μg/mouse for 3-6 hours) or vehicle (control); intestines were collected and
analyzed by immunofluorescence, or RNA and protein were collected from the
mucosa.
RESULTS: Incubation of IECs with TNF reduced expression of DRA. Knockdown of
NF-κB inhibitor α in IECs led to nuclear translocation of the NF-κB subunit p65
and reduced levels of DRA messenger RNA and protein. Expression of a transgene
encoding p65 or p50 in IECs led to significant reductions in the promoter
activity of DRA and its expression. In chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, p65 
bound directly to the promoter of DRA, at the regions of -935 to -629 and -375
to -84. Injection of mice with TNF or incubation of crypt-derived enteroids with 
TNF reduced their expression of DRA messenger RNA and protein.
CONCLUSIONS: In human IECs and intestinal tissues from mice, we found TNF to
activate NF-κB, which reduced expression of the Cl- / HCO3- exchanger DRA
(SLC26A3), via direct binding to the promoter of DRA. This pathway is an
important therapeutic target for inflammatory bowel disease-associated diarrhea.

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of NOD2/CARD15 gene
mutations in a group of Moroccan patients with Crohn's disease and to study its
correlation with genotype-phenotypic expression. We conducted a cross-sectional
case-control study over a period of 16 months. 101 patients with Crohn's disease 
were enrolled between January 2012 and April 2013 as well as a control group of
107 patients. We performed a genetic analysis to identify 3 NOD2 gene variants:
p.Arg702Trp, p.Gly908Arg and p.Leu1007fsins. Then we conducted a study of the
correlation between genotype and phenotypic expression. The genetic analysis of
patients with Crohn's disease highlighted the presence of NOD2 mutation in 14
patients (13.77%) versus 7 patients (6.53%) in the control group. The study of
the frequency of different alleles showed p.Gly908Arg mutation in 6.43%,
p.Leu1007fsins in 0.99% and p.Arg702Trp in 0.49% versus 2.80%, 0% and 0.46% in
the control group respectively. The study of the correlation between genotype and
phenotypic expression showed that CARD15 mutation is associated with ileocecal
Crohn's disease, with fistulizing and stenosing behavior in Crohn's disease as
well as with severe evolution and frequent recourse to surgery and
immunosuppressants. The prevalence of NOD2/ CARD15 mutation in our case series is
low. This mutation is correlated with severe Crohn's disease.

BACKGROUND: Thalidomide is an effective therapy in children with inflammatory
bowel disease refractory to standard treatments, but thalidomide-induced
peripheral neuropathy (TiPN) limits its long-term use. We aimed to investigate
the risk factors and the outcome of TiPN in children with inflammatory bowel
disease.
METHODS: Within a retrospective multicenter cohort study, we evaluated prevalence
and evolution of TiPN. Clinical data and candidate genetic profiles of patients
with and without TiPN were compared with detect predisposing factors.
RESULTS: One hundred forty-two patients were identified. TiPN was found in 72.5% 
of patients (38.7% clinical and instrumental alterations, 26.8% exclusive
electrophysiological anomalies, and 7.0% exclusive neurological symptoms). Median
TiPN-free period of treatment was 16.5 months; percentage of TiPN-free patients
was 70.0% and 35.6% at 12 and 24 months of treatment, respectively. The risk of
TiPN increased depending on the mean daily dose (50-99 mg/d adjusted hazard ratio
2.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.31-5.21; 100-149 mg/d adjusted hazard ratio
6.16; 95% CI, 20.9-13.06; >150 mg/d adjusted hazard ratio 9.57; 95% CI,
2.6-35.2). Single nucleotide polymorphisms in ICAM1 (rs1799969) and SERPINB2
(rs6103) genes were found to be protective against TiPN (odds ratio 0.15; 95% CI,
0.03-0.82 and 0.36; 95% CI, 0.14-0.88, respectively). TiPN was the cause of drug 
suspension in 41.8% of patients. Clinical symptoms resolved in 89.2% of cases,
whereas instrumental alteration persisted in more than half of the patients
during a short follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: In children with inflammatory bowel disease, TiPN is common but mild
and generally reversible. Cumulative dose seems to be the most relevant risk
factor, whereas polymorphisms in genes involved in neuronal inflammation may be
protective.

Gene expression profiling can be used to uncover the mechanisms by which loci
identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) contribute to
pathology. Given that most GWAS hits are in putative regulatory regions and
transcript abundance is physiologically closer to the phenotype of interest, we
hypothesized that summation of risk-allele-associated gene expression, namely a
transcriptional risk score (TRS), should provide accurate estimates of disease
risk. We integrate summary-level GWAS and expression quantitative trait locus
(eQTL) data with RNA-seq data from the RISK study, an inception cohort of
pediatric Crohn's disease. We show that TRSs based on genes regulated by variants
linked to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) not only outperform genetic risk
scores (GRSs) in distinguishing Crohn's disease from healthy samples, but also
serve to identify patients who in time will progress to complicated disease. Our 
dissection of eQTL effects may be used to distinguish genes whose association
with disease is through promotion versus protection, thereby linking statistical 
association to biological mechanism. The TRS approach constitutes a potential
strategy for personalized medicine that enhances inference from static genotypic 
risk assessment.

expression in intestinal epithelial cells.

T cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP) dephosphorylates a number of
substrates, including JAK-STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription)
signaling proteins, which are activated by interferon (IFN)-γ, a major
proinflammatory cytokine involved in conditions such as inflammatory bowel
disease. A critical function of the intestinal epithelium is formation of a
selective barrier to luminal contents. The structural units of the epithelium
that regulate barrier function are the tight junctions (TJs), and the protein
composition of the TJ determines the tightness of the barrier. Claudin-2 is a TJ 
protein that increases permeability to cations and reduces transepithelial
electrical resistance (TER). We previously showed that transient knockdown (KD)
of TCPTP permits increased expression of claudin-2 by IFN-γ. Here, we demonstrate
that the decreased TER in TCPTP-deficient epithelial cells is alleviated by STAT1
KD. Moreover, increased claudin-2 in TCPTP-deficient cells requires enhanced
STAT1 activation and STAT1 binding to the CLDN2 promoter. We also show that
mutation of this STAT-binding site prevents elevated CLDN2 promoter activity in
TCPTP-deficient epithelial cells. In summary, we demonstrate that TCPTP protects 
the intestinal epithelial barrier by restricting STAT-induced claudin-2
expression. This is a potential mechanism by which loss-of-function mutations in 
the gene encoding TCPTP may contribute to barrier defects in chronic intestinal
inflammatory disease.

Background: In addition to strain taxonomy, the ability of probiotics to confer
beneficial effects on the host rely on a number of additional factors including
epigenetic modulation of bacterial genes leading to metabolic variability and
might impact on probiotic functionality. Aims: To investigate metabolism and
functionality of two different batches of a probiotic blend commercialized under 
the same name in Europe in models of intestinal inflammation. Methods: Boxes of
VSL#3, a probiotic mixture used in the treatment of pouchitis, were obtained from
pharmacies in UK subjected to metabolomic analysis and their functionality tested
in mice rendered colitis by treatment with DSS or TNBS. Results: VSL#3-A (lot
DM538), but not VSL#3-B (lot 507132), attenuated "clinical" signs of colitis in
the DSS and TNBS models. In both models, VSL#3-A, but not VSL#3-B, reduced
macroscopic scores, intestinal permeability, and expression of TNFα, IL-1β, and
IL-6 mRNAs, while increased the expression of TGFβ and IL-10, occludin, and
zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) mRNAs and shifted colonic macrophages from a M1 to M2
phenotype (P < 0.05 vs. TNBS). In contrast, VSL#3-B failed to reduce
inflammation, and worsened intestinal permeability in the DSS model (P < 0.001
vs. VSL#3-A). A metabolomic analysis of the two formulations allowed the
identification of two specific patterns, with at least three-folds enrichment in 
the concentrations of four metabolites, including 1-3 dihydroxyacetone (DHA), an 
intermediate in the fructose metabolism, in VSL#3-B supernatants. Feeding mice
with DHA, increased intestinal permeability. Conclusions: Two batches of a
commercially available probiotic show divergent metabolic activities. DHA, a
product of probiotic metabolism, increases intestinal permeability, highlighting 
the complex interactions between food, microbiota, probiotics, and intestinal
inflammation.

Hypoxic tissue conditions occur during a number of inflammatory diseases and are 
associated with the breakdown of barriers and induction of proinflammatory
responses. At the same time, hypoxia is also known to induce several adaptive and
tissue-protective pathways that dampen inflammation and protect tissue integrity.
Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) that are stabilized during inflammatory or
hypoxic conditions are at the center of mediating these responses. In the past
decade, several genes regulating extracellular adenosine metabolism and signaling
have been identified as being direct targets of HIFs. Here, we discuss the
relationship between inflammation, hypoxia, and adenosine and that HIF-driven
adenosine metabolism and signaling is essential in providing tissue protection
during inflammatory conditions, including myocardial injury, inflammatory bowel
disease, and acute lung injury. We also discuss how the hypoxia-adenosine link
can be targeted therapeutically in patients as a future treatment approach for
inflammatory diseases.

Interleukin 1 (IL-1) family is a group of cytokines with multiple local and
systemic effects, which regulates both innate and adaptive immune responses.
Generally, most IL-1 family cytokines express prevailing pro-inflammatory
activities (IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-18, IL-33, IL-36 α, β, γ), whereas others are
anti-inflammatory (IL-1Ra (IL-1 receptor antagonist), IL-36Ra, IL-38, IL-37). In 
addition to their immunomodulatory roles, some of them are also involved in the
physiological modulation of homeostatic processes and directly affect mRNA
transcription. IL-1 family cytokines bind to specific receptors composed of a
ligand-binding chain and an accessory chain. The pro-inflammatory effects of IL-1
family cytokines are regulated on the level of transcription, enzymatic
processing of precursors, release of soluble antagonists, and expression of decoy
receptors. Members of the IL-1 family regulate the recruitment and activation of 
effector cells involved in innate and adaptive immunity, but they are also
involved in the pathogenesis of chronic disorders, including inflammatory bowel
disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and various autoimmune and autoinflammatory
diseases. There are only limited data regarding the role of IL-1 cytokines in
transplantation. In recent years, targeted therapeutics affecting IL-1 have been 
used in multiple clinical studies. In addition to the recombinant IL-1Ra,
anakinra (highly effective in autoinflammatory diseases and tested for other
chronic diseases), the monoclonal antibodies canakinumab, gevokizumab, and
rilonacept (a long-acting IL-1 receptor fusion protein) provide further options
to block IL-1 activity. Furthermore, new inhibitors of IL-18 (GSK 1070806,
ABT-325, rIL-18BP (IL-18 binding protein)) and IL-33 (CNTO-7160) are presently
under clinical studies and other molecules are being developed to target IL-1
family cytokines.

Cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) are key enzymes of arachidonic acid
metabolism. Their products, prostaglandins and leukotrienes, are involved in the 
pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases and colorectal cancer. The aim of the
study was to examine the influence of inositol hexaphosphate (IP6), a naturally
occurring phytochemical, on the expression of genes encoding COX and LOX isoforms
and synthesis of their products (PGE2 and LTB4) in colon cancer cell line Caco-2 
stimulated with pro-inflammatory agents (IL-1β/TNFα). Real-time RT-qPCR was used 
to validate mRNAs level of examined genes. The concentrations of COX-2 and 5-LOX 
proteins as well as PGE2 and LTB4 were determined by the ELISA method. Based on
these studies it may be concluded that IP6 may limit inflammatory events in the
colonic epithelium and prevent colon carcinomas by modulating the expression of
genes encoding COX and LOX isoforms at both mRNA and protein levels as well as by
affecting the synthesis and secretion of prostaglandins and leukotrienes.

BACKGROUND: The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic inflammatory
disorders, associated with genetic, immunologic, and environmental factors.
Although hundreds of genes are implicated in IBD etiology, it is likely that
additional genes play a role in the disease process. We developed a machine
learning-based gene prioritization method to identify novel IBD-risk genes.
METHODS: Known IBD genes were collected from genome-wide association studies and 
annotated with expression and pathway information. Using these genes, a model was
trained to identify IBD-risk genes. A comprehensive list of 16,390 genes was then
scored and classified.
RESULTS: Immune and inflammatory responses, as well as pathways such as cell
adhesion, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and sulfur metabolism were
identified to be related to IBD. Scores predicted for IBD genes were
significantly higher than those for non-IBD genes (P < 10). There was a
significant association between the score and having an IBD publication (P < 10).
Overall, 347 genes had a high prediction score (>0.8). A literature review of the
genes, excluding those used to train the model, identified 67 genes without any
publication concerning IBD. These genes represent novel candidate IBD-risk genes,
which can be targeted in future studies.
CONCLUSIONS: Our method successfully differentiated IBD-risk genes from non-IBD
genes by using information from expression data and a multitude of gene
annotations. Crucial features were defined, and we were able to detect novel
candidate risk genes for IBD. These findings may help detect new IBD-risk genes
and improve the understanding of IBD pathogenesis.

Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a highly disabling condition common for a vast
number of women worldwide. To contribute to existing knowledge in POP
pathogenesis, we performed a systematic review of expression studies on both
specific gene and whole-genome/proteome levels and an in silico analysis of
publicly available datasets related to POP development. The most extensively
investigated genes in individual studies were related to extracellular matrix
(ECM) organization. Three premenopausal and two postmenopausal sets from two Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) studies (GSE53868 and GSE12852) were analyzed; Gene
Ontology (GO) terms related to tissue repair (locomotion, biological adhesion,
immune processes and other) were enriched in all five datasets. Co-expression was
higher in cases than in controls in three premenopausal sets. The shared between 
two or more datasets up-regulated genes were enriched with those related to
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in the NHGRI GWAS Catalog. ECM-related genes
were not over-represented among differently expressed genes. Up-regulation of
genes related to tissue renewal probably reflects compensatory mechanisms aimed
at repair of damaged tissue. Inefficiency of this process may have different
origins including age-related deregulation of gene expression.

Visceral fat accumulation as observed in Crohn's disease and obesity is linked to
chronic gut inflammation, suggesting that accumulation of gut adipocytes can
trigger local inflammatory signaling. However, direct interactions between
intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and adipocytes have not been investigated, in 
part because IEC physiology is difficult to replicate in culture. In this study, 
we originally prepared intact, polarized, and cytokine responsive IEC monolayers 
from primary or induced pluripotent stem cell-derived intestinal organoids by
simple and repeatable methods. When these physiological IECs were co-cultured
with differentiated adipocytes in Transwell, pro-inflammatory genes were induced 
in both cell types, suggesting reciprocal inflammatory activation in the absence 
of immunocompetent cells. These inflammatory responses were blocked by nuclear
factor-κB or signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 inhibition and by
anti-tumor necrosis factor- or anti-interleukin-6-neutralizing antibodies. Our
results highlight the utility of these monolayers for investigating IEC biology. 
Furthermore, this system recapitulates the intestinal epithelium-mesenteric fat
signals that potentially trigger or worsen inflammatory disorders such as Crohn's
disease and obesity-related enterocolitis.

AIM: To investigate genetic factors that might help define which Crohn's disease 
(CD) patients are likely to benefit from anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
therapy.
METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study. Patients were recruited from a
university digestive disease practice database. We included CD patients who
received anti-TNF therapy, had available medical records (with information on
treatment duration and efficacy) and who consented to participation. Patients
with allergic reactions were excluded. Patients were grouped as ever-responders
or non-responders. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood, and 7 single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were assessed. The main outcome measure
(following exposure to the drug) was response to therapy. The patient genotypes
were assessed as the predictors of outcome. Possible confounders and effect
modifiers included age, gender, race, and socioeconomic status disease, as well
as disease characteristics (such as Montreal criteria).
RESULTS: 121 patients were included. Twenty-one were non-responders, and 100 were
ever-responders. Fas ligand SNP (rs763110) genotype frequencies, TNF gene -308
SNP (rs1800629) genotype frequencies, and their combination, were significantly
different between groups on multivariable analysis controlling for Montreal
disease behavior and perianal disease. The odds of a patient with a Fas ligand CC
genotype being a non-responder were four-fold higher as compared to a TC or TT
genotype (P = 0.009, OR = 4.30, 95%CI: 1.45-12.80). The presence of the A (minor)
TNF gene -308 allele correlated with three-fold higher odds of being a
non-responder (P = 0.049, OR = 2.88, 95%CI: 1.01-8.22). Patients with the
combination of the Fas ligand CC genotype and the TNF -308 A allele had nearly
five-fold higher odds of being a non-responder (P = 0.015, OR = 4.76, 95%CI:
1.35-16.77). No difference was seen for the remaining SNPs.
CONCLUSION: The Fas-ligand SNP and TNF gene -308 SNP are associated with anti-TNF
treatment response in CD and may help select patients likely to benefit from
therapy.

AIM: To study the genetic association and epistatic interaction of the
interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-10/STAT3 pathways in pediatric inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD).
METHODS: A total of 159 pediatric inflammatory IBD patients (Crohn's disease, n =
136; ulcerative colitis, n = 23) and 129 matched controls were studied for
genetic association of selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the
IL-10 gene and the genes IL10RA, IL10RB, STAT3, and HO1, from the IL-10/STAT3
signaling pathway. As interactions between SNPs from different loci may
significantly affect the associated risk for disease, additive (a) and dominant
(d) modeling of SNP interactions was also performed to examine high-order
epistasis between combinations of the individual SNPs.
RESULTS: The results showed that IL-10 rs304496 was associated with pediatric IBD
(P = 0.022), but no association was found for two other IL-10 SNPs, rs1800872 and
rs2034498, or for SNPs in genes IL10RA, IL10RB, STAT3, and HO1. However, analysis
of epistatic interaction among these genes showed significant interactions: (1)
between two IL-10 SNPs rs1800872 and rs3024496 (additive-additive P = 0.00015,
Bonferroni P value (Bp) = 0.003); (2) between IL-10RB rs2834167 and HO1 rs2071746
(dominant-additive, P = 0.0018, Bp = 0.039); and (3) among IL-10 rs1800872,
IL10RB rs2834167, and HO1 rs2071746 (additive-dominant-additive, P = 0.00015, Bp 
= 0.005), as well as weak interactions among IL-10 rs1800872, IL-10 rs3024496,
and IL-10RA (additive-additive-additive, P = 0.003; Bp = 0.099), and among
IL10RA, IL10RB, and HO1 genes (additive-dominant-additive, P = 0.008, Bp =
0.287).
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that both the IL-10 gene itself, and through
epistatic interaction with genes within the IL-10/STAT3 signaling pathway,
contribute to the risk of pediatric IBD.

Epigenetic "readers" that recognize defined posttranslational modifications on
histones have become desirable therapeutic targets for cancer and inflammation.
SP140 is one such bromodomain- and plant homeodomain (PHD)-containing reader with
immune-restricted expression, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within
SP140 associate with Crohn's disease (CD). However, the function of SP140 and the
consequences of disease-associated SP140 SNPs have remained unclear. We show that
SP140 is critical for transcriptional programs that uphold the macrophage state. 
SP140 preferentially occupies promoters of silenced, lineage-inappropriate genes 
bearing the histone modification H3K27me3, such as the HOXA cluster in human
macrophages, and ensures their repression. Depletion of SP140 in mouse or human
macrophages resulted in severely compromised microbe-induced activation. We
reveal that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or B cells from
individuals carrying CD-associated SNPs within SP140 have defective SP140
messenger RNA splicing and diminished SP140 protein levels. Moreover, CD patients
carrying SP140 SNPs displayed suppressed innate immune gene signatures in a mixed
population of PBMCs that stratified them from other CD patients.
Hematopoietic-specific knockdown of Sp140 in mice resulted in exacerbated dextran
sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, and low SP140 levels in human CD intestinal
biopsies correlated with relatively lower intestinal innate cytokine levels and
improved response to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy. Thus, the
epigenetic reader SP140 is a key regulator of macrophage transcriptional programs
for cellular state, and a loss of SP140 due to genetic variation contributes to a
molecularly defined subset of CD characterized by ineffective innate immunity,
normally critical for intestinal homeostasis.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Interactions between commensal microbes and the immune system 
are tightly regulated and maintain intestinal homeostasis, but little is known
about these interactions in humans. We investigated responses of human CD4+ T
cells to the intestinal microbiota. We measured the abundance of T cells in
circulation and intestinal tissues that respond to intestinal microbes and
determined their clonal diversity. We also assessed their functional phenotypes
and effects on intestinal resident cell populations, and studied alterations in
microbe-reactive T cells in patients with chronic intestinal inflammation.
METHODS: We collected samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and
intestinal tissues from healthy individuals (controls, n = 13-30) and patients
with inflammatory bowel diseases (n = 119; 59 with ulcerative colitis and 60 with
Crohn's disease). We used 2 independent assays (CD154 detection and
carboxy-fluorescein succinimidyl ester dilution assays) and 9 intestinal
bacterial species (Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium
animalis subsp lactis, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Bacteroides vulgatus,
Roseburia intestinalis, Ruminococcus obeum, Salmonella typhimurium, and
Clostridium difficile) to quantify, expand, and characterize microbe-reactive
CD4+ T cells. We sequenced T-cell receptor Vβ genes in expanded microbe-reactive 
T-cell lines to determine their clonal diversity. We examined the effects of
microbe-reactive CD4+ T cells on intestinal stromal and epithelial cell lines.
Cytokines, chemokines, and gene expression patterns were measured by flow
cytometry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: Circulating and gut-resident CD4+ T cells from controls responded to
bacteria at frequencies of 40-4000 per million for each bacterial species tested.
Microbiota-reactive CD4+ T cells were mainly of a memory phenotype, present in
peripheral blood mononuclear cells and intestinal tissue, and had a diverse
T-cell receptor Vβ repertoire. These cells were functionally heterogeneous,
produced barrier-protective cytokines, and stimulated intestinal stromal and
epithelial cells via interleukin 17A, interferon gamma, and tumor necrosis
factor. In patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, microbiota-reactive CD4+ T 
cells were reduced in the blood compared with intestine; T-cell responses that we
detected had an increased frequency of interleukin 17A production compared with
responses of T cells from blood or intestinal tissues of controls.
CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and intestinal 
tissues from patients with inflammatory bowel diseases vs controls, we found that
reactivity to intestinal bacteria is a normal property of the human CD4+ T-cell
repertoire, and does not necessarily indicate disrupted interactions between
immune cells and the commensal microbiota. T-cell responses to commensals might
support intestinal homeostasis, by producing barrier-protective cytokines and
providing a large pool of T cells that react to pathogens.

Strengthening intestinal tight junctions (TJ) provides an effective barrier from 
the external environment and is important for recovery from inflammatory bowel
disease. Oxyresveratrol (OXY), an isomer of hydroxylated resveratrol, is isolated
from many plants. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of OXY on
intestinal TJ and to elucidate the mechanism underlying the OXY-mediated increase
in TJ integrity in human intestinal Caco-2 cells. OXY-treated Caco-2 cell
monolayers showed decreased monolayer permeability as evaluated by paracellular
transport assay. The results showed that OXY significantly increased the levels
of TJ-related genes and proteins (Claudin-1, Occludin and ZO-1) compared with
those of the negative control. OXY activated protein kinase C (PKC) and increased
expression levels of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) genes. OXY also
increased gene and protein levels of the transcription factor Cdx-2. Expression
levels of TJ, PKC and Cdx-2 proteins and transepithelial electrical resistance
(TEER) value decreased in OXY-treated Caco-2 cells following treatment with a
pan-PKC inhibitor compared with those of the untreated control. In conclusion,
OXY strengthens the integrity of the intestinal TJ barrier via activation of the 
PKC and MAPK pathways.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in developed countries is linked with elevated
hygienic standards. One of the several factors involved in this question may be
reduced exposure to the immunomodulatory effects of parasitic helminths. Several 
investigations on treatment of mice and humans with helminth-derived substances
have supported this notion, but underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study 
therefore dissects to what extent a series of immune-related genes are modulated 
in zebrafish with experimentally induced colitis following exposure to
excretory-secretory (ES) products isolated from larval Anisakis, a widely
distributed fish nematode. Adult zebrafish intrarectally exposed to the
colitis-inducing agent TNBS developed severe colitis leading to 80% severe
morbidity, but if co-injected (ip) with Anisakis ES products, the morbidity rate 
was 50% at the end of the experiment (48 hours post-exposure). Gene expression
studies of TNBS-treated zebrafish showed clear upregulation of a range of genes
encoding inflammatory cytokines and effector molecules and some induction of
genes related to the adaptive response. A distinct innate-driven immune response 
was seen in both TNBS and TNBS + ES groups, but expression values were
significantly depressed for several important pro-inflammatory genes in the
TNBS + ES group, indicating protective mechanisms of Anisakis ES compounds on
intestinal immunopathology in zebrafish.

gastrointestinal disorder are still unclear. Cumulating data suggest
dysregulation of inflammatory and immune response pathways and changes of
epithelial barrier function. The role of estrogens albeit varied, in responses of
immune system is well documented. The aim of this study was to investigate
estrogen receptors engagment in IBS subtypes, i.e. constipation predominant
(IBS-C) and diarrhea predominant (IBS-D). Furthermore, we analyzed whether
estrogen signaling is accompanied by alteration in expression of pro- and
anti-inflammatory cytokines and microRNAs that can regulate among others genes
involved in immune responses. It was found that estrogen receptor α (ERα) and G
protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) expression is up-regulated in IBS while 
estrogen receptor β (ERβ) appears to be down-regulated at mRNA but up-regulated
at the protein level. When gender and female age were included statistically
significant overexpression of ERα in IBS-D women under the age of 50, while of
GPER in IBS-D men was stated. In all studied IBS samples disturbances in
expression of cytokines IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α as well as miR-145, miR-148-5p and 
miR-592 were observed. This research reveals the association of estrogen
receptors with IBS. Simultaneous alterations of studied immunomodulatory
cytokines and microRNAs suggest that in IBS dysregulation of local immune
response may involve estrogen-dependent way.

BACKGROUND: Human polymorphisms with derived alleles that are protective against 
disease may provide powerful translational opportunities. Here we report a method
to identify such candidate polymorphisms and apply it to common non-synonymous
SNPs (nsSNPs) associated with common diseases. Our study also sought to establish
which of the identified protective nsSNPs show evidence of positive selection,
taking this as indirect evidence that the protective variant has a beneficial
effect on phenotype. Further, we performed an analysis to quantify the predicted 
effect of each protective variant on protein function/structure.
RESULTS: An initial analysis of eight SNPs previously identified as associated
with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), revealed that two of them have a
derived allele that is protective against developing the disease. One is in the
complement component 2 gene (C2; E318D) and the other is in the complement factor
B gene (CFB; R32Q). Then, combining genomewide ancestral allele information with 
known common disease-associated nsSNPs from the GWAS catalog, we found 32
additional SNPs which have a derived allele that is disease protective. Out of
the total 34 identified candidate protective variants (CPVs), we found that 30
show stronger evidence of positive selection than the protective variant in
lipoprotein lipase (LPL; S447X), which has already been translated into gene
therapy. Furthermore, 11 of these CPVs have a higher probability of affecting
protein structure than the lipoprotein lipase protective variant (LPL; S447X).
CONCLUSIONS: We identify 34 CPVs from the human genome. Diseases they confer
protection against include, but are not limited to, type 2 diabetes, inflammatory
bowel disease, age-related macular degeneration, multiple sclerosis and
rheumatoid arthritis. We propose that those 30 CPVs with evidence of stronger
positive selection than the LPL protective variant, may be considered as priority
candidates for therapeutic approaches. The next step towards translation will
require testing the hypotheses generated by our analyses, specifically whether
the CPV arose from a gain-of-function or a loss-of-function mutation.

Impaired Paneth cell expression of antimicrobial protein (AMP) lysozyme is found 
in patients with Crohn's disease with the autophagy gene ATG16L1 risk allele, in 
mice with mutations in autophagy genes Atg16L1, Atg5 and Atg7, and in Irgm1
knockout mice. Defective autophagy is also associated with expansion of resident 
Gram-negative bacteria in the intestinal lumen. These findings suggest that
autophagy may control extracellular resident microbes by governing expression of 
lysozyme. To test the hypothesis that autophagy may have a defensive role in host
response to resident extracellular microbes, we investigated the relationship
between gut microbes, autophagy, and lysozyme. RAW 264.7 macrophages were treated
with fecal slurry (FS), representing the resident microbial community;
lipopolysaccharide (LPS); or butyrate, representing microbial products; or a
representative resident Gram-negative bacterium Desulfovibrio vulgaris (DSV). FS,
LPS, and DSV inhibited lysozyme expression, whereas butyrate had no effect.
Induction of autophagy by rapamycin countered this inhibition, whereas silencing 
of the autophagy gene Irgm1 exacerbated the inhibitory effects of LPS on lysozyme
expression. LPS also inhibited lysozyme activity against DSV and autophagy
reversed this effect. Our results provide a novel insight into an interaction
between gut bacteria, autophagy and AMP whereby autophagy may defend the host by 
countering the suppression of antimicrobial protein by Gram-negative bacteria.

The anti-inflammatory genes, haem oxygenase 1 (HO-1, HMOX1) rs2071746
(unrestricted model: p = 9.07 × 10-4; recessive model: p = 4.99 × 10-4;
multiplicative model: p = 0.0009; and additive model: p = 1.87 × 10-4) and
interleukin-10 (IL-10) rs1800872 (dominant model: p = 0.0277) have been
associated with paediatric inflammatory bowel disease. The present family-based
case-trio study (n = 52) examined HO-1 gene expression in the presence of
proinflammatory lipopolysaccharide and tumour necrosis factor-alpha in four B
lymphocyte cell lines established from children with inflammatory bowel disease
and demonstrated that mutations in IL-10 and IL-10 receptor B reduced HO-1
messenger RNA expression. This observation supports our hypothesis that HO-1 is
regulated by the IL-10/STAT3 pathway and that both genes (IL10 and STAT3) could
be involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. We also compared
HO-1 expression in diseased intestinal tissues with adjacent normal tissues from 
adults with inflammatory bowel disease. Of the 17 Crohn's disease patients, HO-1 
expression in diseased tissues was downregulated in 9 patients (53%) and of the
10 ulcerative colitis patients HO-1 was downregulated in 7 patients (70%),
compared with adjacent normal tissues. The downregulation of HO-1 gene expression
may lower anti-inflammatory effects and worsen tissue injury in affected areas by
inflammatory bowel disease.

The role of ABCB1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the development of
Crohn's disease (CD) remains unclear. Due to inconsistent results of several
European population-based studies and limited information on populations from
Poland and Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&H), we conducted a preliminary association
study of two main ABCB1 SNPs and CD. ABCB1 3435C>T and 2677G>T/A SNPs were
analyzed in Polish and Bosnian patients with CD (n = 85 and n = 30, respectively)
and controls (n = 82 and n = 30, respectively) using polymerase chain
reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) for 3435C>T and
allele-specific PCR for 2677G>A/T SNP. A deviation from Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium was found for both SNPs in Polish patients with CD, and for 2677G>A/T
in Polish control group. The allele and genotype frequencies of the two ABCB1
SNPs were not significantly different between the CD patients and controls in
both populations (p > 0.05). Similarly, the genotype distribution of 3435C>T and 
2677G>T/A SNPs was not significantly different between Polish and Bosnian
patients with CD (p > 0.05). At least one mutated ABCB1 allele was carried by
97.7% of Polish and 90.0% of Bosnian patients with CD. No association was found
between the ABCB1 SNPs and CD in the two populations. In conclusion, the two
ABCB1 SNPs may not contribute to CD susceptibility in the populations of Poland
and B&H. Further studies with larger samples in both populations are warranted.

Genomic technologies inform the complex genetic basis of polygenic inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD) as well as Mendelian disease-associated IBD. Aiming to
diagnose patients that present with extreme phenotypes due to monogenic forms of 
IBD, genomics has progressed from 'orphan disease' research towards an integrated
standard of clinical care. Advances in diagnostic clinical genomics are
increasingly complemented by pathway-specific therapies that aim to correct the
consequences of genetic defects. This highlights the exceptional potential for
personalized precision medicine. IBD is nevertheless a challenging example for
genomic medicine because the overall fraction of patients with Mendelian defects 
is low, the number of potential candidate genes is high, and interventional
evidence is still emerging. We discuss requirements and prospects of explanatory 
and predictive clinical genomics in IBD.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Inflammatory bowel disease is most often a polygenic disorder 
with contributions from the intestinal microbiome, defects in barrier function,
and dysregulated host responses to microbial stimulation. There is, however,
increasing recognition of single gene defects that underlie a subset of patients 
with inflammatory bowel disease, particularly those with early-onset disease, and
this review focuses on the primary immunodeficiencies associated with early-onset
inflammatory bowel disease.
RECENT FINDINGS: The advent of next-generation sequencing has led to an improved 
recognition of single gene defects underlying some cases of inflammatory bowel
disease. Among single gene defects, immune response genes are the most frequent
category identified. This is also true of common genetic variants associated with
inflammatory bowel disease, supporting a pivotal role for host responses in the
pathogenesis. This review focuses on practical aspects related to diagnosis and
management of children with inflammatory bowel disease who have underlying
primary immunodeficiencies.

OBJECTIVE: The SLC44A4 gene was recently reported to be associated with
ulcerative colitis (UC) susceptibility in the Indian and Japanese populations.
The aim of our study was to investigate the association of common variants within
the SLC44A4 gene and the susceptibility to UC among the Han Chinese.
METHODS: We examined 16 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the
SLC44A4 gene in a Han Chinese population that consisted of 311 UC patients and
675 healthy controls; both SNP and haplotypic association analyses were
performed.
RESULTS: We found that rs2736428 was significantly associated with UC risk
(allelic p = 0.0004), and the CT and TT genotypes of rs2736428 had a higher
distribution compared with the CC genotypes (genotypic p = 0.001), suggesting
that the T allele was a risk allele (odds ratio = 1.45, 95% confidence
interval = 1.18-1.78). Moreover, one haplotype block that included rs2736428 was 
found to be strongly associated with UC risk as well (global p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Our results provide further supportive evidence for an important role
of the SLC44A4 gene in the pathogenesis of UC.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease, whereas Crohn's disease 
is an inflammatory bowel disease. Interestingly, polymorphisms in the LRRK2 gene 
have been identified as risk factors for both diseases. LRRK2 G2019S is the most 
prevalent mutation found in PD. To gain insights into the role of the LRRK2
G2019S gene on the development and activation of the immune system in the
brain-gut axis, we investigated the effect of LRRK2 G2019S on bone marrow myeloid
progenitors and myeloid cell function in the periphery. We used bacterial
artificial chromosome transgenic rats harboring the human LRRK2 G2019S gene.
LRRK2 G2019S transgene decreased the numbers of monocytic and granulocytic
progenitors in the bone marrow. However, the numbers of peripheral, immature
myeloid cells with suppressive activity were increased in the gut and blood
circulation of LRRK2 G2019S compared with control rats in various acute and
chronic inflammatory responses. In inflammatory conditions, Th17 cell activity
was suppressed, but tissue-associated phylum Bacteroidetes was abnormally
increased in the intestine of LRRK2 G2019S rats. The abnormally expanded myeloid 
cells because of the LRRK2 G2019S gene were highly suppressive on Th17 cell
differentiation. Moreover, we found that inhibition of LRRK2 kinase affects
myeloid progenitors and myeloid cell differentiation. Taken together, the results
indicate that abnormal LRRK2 activity can alter bone marrow myelopoiesis,
peripheral myeloid cell differentiation, and intestinal immune homeostasis. These
findings may have ramifications in immune and inflammatory responses in patients 
with LRRK2 abnormalities.

BACKGROUND: The assessment and characterization of the gut microbiome has become 
a focus of research in the area of human autoimmune diseases. Ankylosing
spondylitis is an inflammatory autoimmune disease and evidence showed that
ankylosing spondylitis may be a microbiome-driven disease.
RESULTS: To investigate the relationship between the gut microbiome and
ankylosing spondylitis, a quantitative metagenomics study based on deep shotgun
sequencing was performed, using gut microbial DNA from 211 Chinese individuals. A
total of 23,709 genes and 12 metagenomic species were shown to be differentially 
abundant between ankylosing spondylitis patients and healthy controls. Patients
were characterized by a form of gut microbial dysbiosis that is more prominent
than previously reported cases with inflammatory bowel disease. Specifically, the
ankylosing spondylitis patients demonstrated increases in the abundance of
Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella copri, and Prevotella sp. C561 and
decreases in Bacteroides spp. It is noteworthy that the Bifidobacterium genus,
which is commonly used in probiotics, accumulated in the ankylosing spondylitis
patients. Diagnostic algorithms were established using a subset of these gut
microbial biomarkers.
CONCLUSIONS: Alterations of the gut microbiome are associated with development of
ankylosing spondylitis. Our data suggest biomarkers identified in this study
might participate in the pathogenesis or development process of ankylosing
spondylitis, providing new leads for the development of new diagnostic tools and 
potential treatments.

Inflammation plays a significant role in protecting hosts against pathogens.
Inflammation induced by non-infectious, endogenous agents can be detrimental, and
if excessive can result in organ and tissue damage. The inflammasome is a major
innate immune pathway that can be activated via both exogenous
pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and endogenous damage-associated
molecular patterns (DAMPs). Inflammasome activation involves formation and
oligomerization of a protein complex including a NOD-like receptor (NLR), an
adaptor protein (ASC) and procaspase-1. This then allows cleavage and activation 
of caspase-1, followed by downstream cleavage and release of proinflammatory
cytokines, IL-1β and IL-18, from innate immune cells. Hyperinflammation caused by
unrestrained inflammasome activation is linked with multiple inflammatory
diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, Alzheimer's disease and multiple 
sclerosis. So there is an understandable rush to understand mechanisms that
regulate such potent inflammatory pathways. Autophagy has now been identified as 
a main regulator of inflammasomes. Autophagy is a vital intracellular process
involved in cellular homeostasis, recycling and removal of damaged organelles
(e.g. mitochondria) and intracellular pathogens. Autophagy is regulated by
proteins that are important in endosomal/phagosomal pathways, as well as by
specific autophagy proteins coded for by autophagy-related genes. Cytosolic
components are surrounded and contained by a double-membraned vesicle, which then
fuses with lysosomes to enable degradation of the contents. Autophagic removal of
intracellular DAMPs, inflammasome components or cytokines can reduce inflammasome
activation. Similarly, inflammasomes can regulate the autophagic process,
allowing for a two-way, mutual regulation of inflammation that may hold the key
for treatment of multiple diseases.

AIM: To investigate alterations in the fecal microbiome using 16S rRNA amplicon
sequencing in couples in the same cohabitation environment.
METHODS: Fecal samples were collected from eight ulcerative colitis (UC) patients
and their healthy partners at Lishui People's Hospital, Zhejiang Province, China.
DNA was extracted and the variable regions V3 and V4 of the 16S rRNA genes were
PCR amplified using a two-step protocol. Clear reads were clustered into
operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at the 97% sequence similarity level using
UCLUST v1.2.22. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test (R v3.1.2) was used to compare
inter-individual differences. Differences with a P value < 0.05 were considered
statistically significant.
RESULTS: Fecal microbial communities were more similar among UC patients than
their healthy partners (P = 0.024). UC individuals had a lower relative abundance
of bacteria belonging to the Firmicutes, especially Blautia, Clostridium,
Coprococcus and Roseburia (P < 0.05). Microbiota dysbiosis was detected in UC
patients and their healthy partners. Relevant genera included Akkermansiam,
Bacteroides, Escherichia, Lactobacillales, Klebsiella and Parabacteroides. The
enriched pathways in fecal samples of UC patients were related to lipid and
nucleotide metabolism. Additionally, the pathways involved in membrane transport 
and metabolism of cofactors and vitamins were more abundant in the healthy
partners.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that the microbial composition might be
affected in healthy partners cohabiting with UC patients, especially in terms of 
microbiota dysbiosis.

OBJECTIVE To determine whether specific alleles of candidate genes of the major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) and innate immune system were associated with
gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV) in Great Danes. ANIMALS 42 healthy Great Danes 
(control group) and 39 Great Danes with ≥ 1 GDV episode. PROCEDURES Variable
regions of the 2 most polymorphic MHC genes (DLA88 and DRB1) were amplified and
sequenced from the dogs in each group. Similarly, regions of 3 genes associated
with the innate immune system (TLR5, NOD2, and ATG16L1), which have been linked
to inflammatory bowel disease, were amplified and sequenced. Alleles were
evaluated for associations with GDV, controlling for age and dog family. RESULTS 
Specific alleles of genes DLA88, DRB1, and TLR5 were significantly associated
with GDV. One allele of each gene had an OR > 2 in the unadjusted univariate
analyses and retained a hazard ratio > 2 after controlling for temperament, age, 
and familial association in the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL
RELEVANCE The 3 GDV-associated alleles identified in this study may serve as
diagnostic markers for identification of Great Danes at risk for GDV. Additional 
research is needed to determine whether other dog breeds have the same genetic
associations. These findings also provided a new target for research into the
etiology of, and potential treatments for, GDV in dogs.

Chemokines are key signals in the immune system and play an important role as
proinflammatory mediators in the pathology of inflammatory bowel disease and
colorectal cancer, making them an important target for therapy. Recombinant
lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were engineered to bind CC and CXC chemokines by
displaying chemokine-binding proteins evasin-1, evasin-3 and evasin-4 on their
surface. Evasin genes were cloned into lactococcal surface display vector and
overexpressed in L. lactis NZ9000 and NZ9000ΔhtrA in fusion with secretion signal
and surface anchor. Evasin-displaying bacteria removed from 15% to 90% of 11
different chemokines from the solution as determined with ELISA and Luminex
multiplexing assays, whereby L. lactis NZ9000ΔhtrA proved more efficient.
Lactobacillus salivarius ATCC 11741 was coated with L. . lactis-expressed evasin 
fusion protein, and its ability to bind chemokines was also confirmed.
Evasin-3-displaying L. lactis removed 76.0% of IL-1β-induced CXCL8 from the
supernatant of Caco-2 epithelial cells. It also prevented secretion of CXCL8 from
Caco-2 cells in a time-dependent manner when added before induction with IL-1β.
Evasin-displaying LAB have the ability to bind multiple chemokines simultaneously
and exert synergistic activity. This innovative treatment approach therefore has 
the potential for mucosal therapy of inflammatory bowel disease or colorectal
cancer.

Bifidobacterium longum (B. Longum) is a common probiotic colonized in the human
gut and against the development of chronic inflammation including inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD). But the underlying mechanism remains unknown. The aim of
this study was to evaluate the affection of B. longum on the methylation levels
of forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) promoter. 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid
(TNBS)-induced colitis rat models were treated with B. longum or medium,
respectively. The genomic DNA of spleen peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)
cells was extracted. After bisulphite treatment and pyrosequencing, the
methylation levels of each CpG sites in the promoter of forkhead box protein P3
(Foxp3) were analyzed. B. Longum treatment changes the methylation level in Foxp3
promoter in TNBS-treated colitis rats, and significantly demethylates several CpG
sites in Foxp3 promoter. The demethylation of Foxp3 promoter might be involved in
the effectiveness of B. Longum treatment for IBD. Further research remains
necessary to investigate the role of B. Longum in Foxp3 demethylation. Using
B. Longum or its metabolic products is an option for further investigations on
potential treatments for IBD.

BACKGROUND: Escherichia coli (E. coli) has been increasingly implicated in the
pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). The phylogeny of E. coli isolated from
Crohn's disease patients (CDEC) was controversial, and while genotyping results
suggested heterogeneity, the sequenced strains of E. coli from CD patients were
closely related.
RESULTS: We performed the shotgun genome sequencing of 28 E. coli isolates from
ten CD patients and compared genomes from these isolates with already published
genomes of CD strains and other pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains. CDEC was
shown to belong to A, B1, B2 and D phylogenetic groups. The plasmid and several
operons from the reference CD-associated E. coli strain LF82 were demonstrated to
be more often present in CDEC genomes belonging to different phylogenetic groups 
than in genomes of commensal strains. The operons include carbon-source induced
invasion GimA island, prophage I, iron uptake operons I and II, capsular assembly
pathogenetic island IV and propanediol and galactitol utilization operons.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that CDEC are phylogenetically diverse.
However, some strains isolated from independent sources possess highly similar
chromosome or plasmids. Though no CD-specific genes or functional domains were
present in all CD-associated strains, some genes and operons are more often found
in the genomes of CDEC than in commensal E. coli. They are principally linked to 
gut colonization and utilization of propanediol and other sugar alcohols.

Finding suitable alternative protein sources for diets of carnivorous fish
species remains a major concern for sustainable aquaculture. Through genetic
selection, we created a strain of rainbow trout that outperforms parental lines
in utilizing an all-plant protein diet and does not develop enteritis in the
distal intestine, as is typical with salmonids on long-term plant protein-based
feeds. By incorporating this strain into functional analyses, we set out to
determine which genes are critical to plant protein utilization in the absence of
gut inflammation. After a 12-week feeding trial with our selected strain and a
control trout strain fed either a fishmeal-based diet or an all-plant protein
diet, high-throughput RNA sequencing was completed on both liver and muscle
tissues. Differential gene expression analyses, weighted correlation network
analyses and further functional characterization were performed. A strain-by-diet
design revealed differential expression ranging from a few dozen to over one
thousand genes among the various comparisons and tissues. Major gene ontology
groups identified between comparisons included those encompassing central,
intermediary and foreign molecule metabolism, associated biosynthetic pathways as
well as immunity. A systems approach indicated that genes involved in purine
metabolism were highly perturbed. Systems analysis among the tissues tested
further suggests the interplay between selection for growth, dietary utilization 
and protein tolerance may also have implications for nonspecific immunity. By
combining data from differential gene expression and co-expression networks using
selected trout, along with ontology and pathway analyses, a set of 63 candidate
genes for plant diet tolerance was found. Risk loci in human inflammatory bowel
diseases were also found in our datasets, indicating rainbow trout selected for
plant-diet tolerance may have added utility as a potential biomedical model.

AIM: To investigate the effects of Ground Cherry (Physalis angulata L.)
standardized supercritical CO2 extract in trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS)
model of rat intestinal inflammation.
METHODS: The animals were divided into groups that received vehicle or P.
angulata extract (PACO2) orally at the doses 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg daily by 5 d
before TNBS damage. Protective effects of PACO2 were assessed by macroscopic
analysis, biochemical determinations of the levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO),
alkaline phosphatase (ALP), glutathione and cytokines (such as INF-γ, IL-1β,
IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α), gene expression evaluation (including Hsp70, heparanase, 
NF-κB, mitogen-activated protein kinases (Mapk) 1, 3, 6 and 9, and the mucins
genes Muc 1, 2, 3 and 4) and histopathological studies using optical, and
electronic (transmission and scanning) microscopy.
RESULTS: PACO2 extract promoted a significant reduction in MPO and ALP
activities, reducing oxidative stress and neutrophil infiltration. These effects 
were accompanied by significant reduction of colonic levels of IFN-γ and IL-6 and
down-regulation of heparanase, Hsp70, Mapk3, Mapk9, Muc1 and Muc2 genes
expression when compared with TNBS-control animals. In addition, protective
effects were also evidenced by reduced neutrophil infiltration, recovery of cell 
architecture and replacement of mucin by histopathological and ultrastructural
analysis.
CONCLUSION: Physalis angulata supercritical CO2 extract is an intestinal
anti-inflammatory product that modulates oxidative stress, immune response and
expression of inflammatory mediators, with potentially utility for treating
inflammatory bowel disease.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease are chronic
inflammatory diseases. Genetic, immunologic, and microbial factors play an
important role in their pathogenesis. Extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1), a
gene related to mucosal barrier function, has been shown to be associated with
UC. This study aims to determine the relationship between ECM1 gene rs3737240
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and UC in a group of Turkish patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-four UC patients and 120 healthy controls were
enrolled in the study. ECM1 gene rs3737240 SNP genotyping was performed using the
polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method.
RESULTS: TT genotype was significantly more common in UC patients than in the
healthy control group [p=0.034; odds ratio (OR) 2.34; 95% confidence interval
(CI) 1.04-5.25]. The presence of C allele significantly lowered the UC risk
(p=0.034; OR 0.42; 95% CI 0.19-0.95). TT genotype was significantly associated
with azathioprine use in UC patients (p=0.037; OR 3.0; 95% CI 1.04-8.65). The C
allele significantly reduced the probability of azathioprine use in UC patients
(p=0.037; OR 0.33 CI 95% 0.11-0.96). No relation was found between rs3737240 SNP 
genotype and the phenotypical characteristics of UC patients.
CONCLUSION: The TT genotype of ECM1 gene rs3737240 SNP significantly increased
susceptibility for UC and azathioprine use in UC patients in a Turkish
population.

OBJECTIVE: Chronic HIV-1 infection leads to widespread inflammation and immune
dysregulation. The gastrointestinal mucosa, a primary site for HIV-1 replication,
is thought to play a significant role in this response. MicroRNAs (miRs) are
small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression, including immune activation
and inflammation. Here we investigate miR expression and function in the colonic 
mucosa during HIV-1 infection.
DESIGN AND METHODS: Using miR profiling, we examined miR expression in the
colonic mucosa of HIV-infected patients. These miRs were further parsed to
identify those that most likely function in HIV-related inflammation. Using
bioinformatics tools, we identified potential target genes which were confirmed
using in-vitro functional testing.
RESULTS: We identified 12 miRs that were differentially expressed in the colonic 
mucosa of HIV-infected patients with high versus undetectable plasma viral
concentrations. Of these, both miR-26a and miR-29a were downregulated in
untreated HIV-1 infection, yet not in the colonic mucosa from inflammatory bowel 
disease. This downregulation occurs within the first hours after infection. These
miRs were further shown to directly target IL-6 and STAT3, respectively, with
similar changes confirmed in an ex-vivo explant infection model.
CONCLUSION: miR-26a and miR-29a levels are decreased in the colonic mucosa during
chronic HIV-1 infection, and this change may be initiated during acute infection.
Both miRs de-repress the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway, which could contribute to 
increased inflammation during infection. These miRs may represent novel
therapeutic targets for HIV-1-associated inflammation in the colonic mucosa.

Patients with Ulcerative Colitis (UC) have an increased risk to develop
colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC). Here, we found that protein
expression of ABCB1 (ATP Binding Cassette Subfamily B Member 1) / MDR1 (multidrug
resistance 1) was diminished in the intestinal mucosa of patients with active UC 
with or without CAC, but not in non-UC patients with sporadic colon cancer. We
investigated the consequences of ABCB1/MDR1 loss-of-function in a common murine
model for CAC (AOM/DSS). Mice deficient in MDR1A (MDR1A KO) showed enhanced
intratumoral inflammation and cellular damage, which were associated with reduced
colonic tumor size and decreased degree of dysplasia, when compared to wild-type 
(WT). Increased cell injury correlated with reduced capacity for growth of MDR1A 
KO tumor spheroids cultured ex-vivo. Gene expression analysis by microarray
demonstrated that MDR1A deficiency shaped the inflammatory response towards an
anti-tumorigenic microenvironment by downregulating genes known to be important
mediators of cancer progression (PTGS2 (COX2), EREG, IL-11). MDR1A KO tumors
showed increased gene expression of TNFSF10 (TRAIL), a known inducer of cancer
cell death, and CCL12, a strong trigger of B cell chemotaxis. Abundant B220+ B
lymphocyte infiltrates with interspersed CD138+ plasma cells were recruited to
the MDR1A KO tumor microenvironment, concomitant with high levels of
immunoglobulin light chain genes. In contrast, MDR1A deficiency in RAG2 KO mice
that lack both B and T cells aggravated colonic tumor progression. MDR1A KO CD19+
B cells, but not WT CD19+ B cells, suppressed growth of colonic tumor-derived
spheroids from AOM/DSS-WT mice in an ex-vivo co-culture system, implying that
B-cell regulated immune responses contributed to delayed tumor development in
MDR1A deficiency. In conclusion, we provide first evidence that loss of
ABCB1/MDR1 function may represent an essential tumor-suppressive host defense
mechanism in CAC.

BACKGROUND: NOD2 and smoking are risk factors for Crohn's disease. We
meta-analyzed NOD2-smoking interactions in Crohn's disease (Phase 1), then
explored the effect of age at diagnosis on NOD2-smoking interactions (Phase 2).
METHODS: Phase 1: MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for studies (n=18) providing
data on NOD2 and smoking in Crohn's disease. NOD2-smoking interactions were
estimated using odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) calculated
using random effects models. Phase 2: A case-only study compared the proportion
of smokers and carriers of the 1007fs variant across ages at diagnosis (≤16,
17-40, >40years).
FINDINGS: Phase 1: Having ever smoked was less common among carriers of the
1007fs variant of NOD2 (OR 0.74, 95%CI:0.66-0.83). There was no interaction
between smoking and the G908R (OR 0.96, 95%CI:0.82-1.13) or the R702W variant (OR
0.89, 95%CI:0.76-1.05). Phase 2: The proportion of patients (n=627) carrying the 
1007fs variant decreased with age at diagnosis (≤16years: 15%; 17-40: 12%; >40:
3%; p=0.003). Smoking was more common in older patients (≤16years: 4%; 17-40:
48%; >40: 71%; p<0.001).
INTERPRETATION: The negative NOD2-smoking interaction in Crohn's disease is
specific to the 1007fs variant. However, opposing rates of this variant and
smoking across age at diagnosis may explain this negative interaction.

Helminths have accompanied human throughout history by releasing immune-evasion
molecules that could counteract an aberrant immune response within the host. In
the past decades, helminth infections are becoming less prevalent possibly due to
the developed sanitation. Meanwhile, the incidence of autoimmune diseases is
increasing, which cannot be exclusively explained by the changes of
susceptibility genes. While the hygiene hypothesis casts light on the problem.
The infections of helminths are believed to interact with and regulate human
immunity with the byproduct of suppressing the autoimmune diseases. Thus,
helminths are potential to treat or cure the autoimmune diseases. The therapeutic
progresses and possible immune suppression mechanisms are illustrated in the
review. The helminths that are studied most intensively include Heligmosomoides
polygyrus, Hymenolepis diminuta, Schistosoma mansoni, Trichinella spiralis, and
Trichuris suis. Special attentions are paid on the booming animal models and
clinical trials that are to detect the efficiency of immune-modulating
helminth-derived molecules on autoimmune diseases. These trials provide us with a
prosperous clinical perspective, but the precise mechanism of the down-regulatory
immune response remains to be clarified. More efforts are needed to be dedicated 
until these parasite-derived immune modulators could be used in clinic to treat
or cure the autoimmune diseases under a standard management.

Although NOD2 is the major inflammatory bowel disease susceptibility gene, its
role in colorectal tumorigenesis is poorly defined. Here, we show that
Nod2-deficient mice are highly susceptible to experimental colorectal
tumorigenesis independent of gut microbial dysbiosis. Interestingly, the
expression of inflammatory genes and the activation of inflammatory pathways,
including NF-κB, ERK, and STAT3 are significantly higher in Nod2-/- mouse colons 
during colitis and colorectal tumorigenesis, but not at homeostasis. Consistent
with higher inflammation, there is greater proliferation of epithelial cells in
hyperplastic regions of Nod2-/- colons. In vitro studies demonstrate that, while 
NOD2 activates the NF-κB and MAPK pathways in response to MDP, it inhibits
TLR-mediated activation of NF-κB and MAPK. Notably, NOD2-mediated downregulation 
of NF-κB and MAPK is associated with the induction of IRF4. Taken together, NOD2 
plays a critical role in the suppression of inflammation and tumorigenesis in the
colon via downregulation of the TLR signaling pathways.

AIM: Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in carcinogenesis in numerous
cancer-related diseases. We examined the copy number variation of mitochondrial
DNA (mtDNA) and the expression of energy-producing genes in relation to
ulcerative colitis (UC)-associated carcinogenesis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 17 patients with UC-associated adenocarcinoma
(UC-Ca) and 16 without UC-associated adenocarcinoma (UC-nonCa). The copy number
of mtDNA in non-dysplastic mucosa in both groups was quantified by an array-based
digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Simultaneously, gene expression
related to mitochondrial energy metabolism was determined by a PCR array.
RESULTS: We observed a higher copy number of mtDNA in non-dysplastic mucosa in
the UC-Ca group compared to the UC-nonCa group (484.2 vs. 747.7 copies/cell,
p=0.022). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative
predictive value for the detection of UC-associated adenocarcinoma by mtDNA copy 
number were 43.8%, 100%, 100%, and 60.9%, respectively. We observed an increased 
expression of mitochondrial genes related to energy metabolism together with an
increased copy number of mtDNA.
CONCLUSION: Mitochondrial function and its metabolic process play essential roles
in UC carcinogenesis and are possible risk markers for the development of colitic
cancer.

Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic condition, which affects the immune system. It 
can also affect any part of the digestive tract and be associated with external
manifestations. The causes of the disease remain unknown, although it seems to be
the result of a combination of factors, such as genetic predisposition,
environment, lifestyle and the composition of the microbiota, among others. The
treatment protocol begins with a change in eating and smoking habits, and is
continued with different lines of treatment, including corticosteroids,
immunomodulators and biologic therapy (infliximab and adalimumab), which have
shown differences in response among patients, especially with biologic treatment.
Several studies have considered the possibility that these differences in
response are caused by the genetic variability of patients. Many genes have been 
investigated as potential predictors of response to biological drugs, such as
ADAM17, ATG16L1, EMSY, CASP9, CCNY, CNTN5, FASLG, FCGR, NOD2, PTGER4, IL13, IL1B,
IL27, IL11, IL17F, TNF and TNFR genes. In this review, we will gather the
information on influence of gene polymorphisms investigated to date on response
to biological drugs in CD patients.

Trefoil factor 3 (TFF3) serves an important role in intestinal mucosal damage and
healing, and contributes to the pathogenesis and treatment of inflammatory bowel 
disease (IBD). The aim of the present study was to determine the association
between TFF3 and microRNA‑7‑5p (miR‑7‑5p) in IBD. Tissue immunohistochemistry was
applied to evaluate the relative expression of TFF3, and reverse
transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to determine
the expression of miR‑7‑5p in lesional tissue obtained from patients with IBD and
healthy control tissues. A dual‑luciferase reporter assay was used to investigate
whether TFF3 was a target of miR‑7‑5p, and western blotting was performed to
determine the expression of TFF3 when miR‑7‑5p was overexpressed or suppressed.
The protein expression levels of TFF3 were decreased and miR‑7‑5p was
overexpressed in the lesional tissue of patients with IBD compared with in
healthy control tissues. TFF3 was identified as a target of miR‑7‑5p, and TFF3
protein expression was negatively regulated by miR‑7‑5p in human colonic
epithelial LS174T cells. The present study demonstrated a negative association
between the expression of miR‑7‑5p and TFF3 in IBD lesional tissues and normal
tissues. In conclusion, TFF3 was identified as a novel target of miR‑7‑5p and
miR‑7‑5p may serve as a promising therapeutic target for IBD.

BACKGROUND: Evidence points to the role of DNA methylation in ulcerative colitis 
(UC)-associated cancer (UCC), the most serious complication of ulcerative
colitis. A better understanding of the etiology of UCC may facilitate the
development of new therapeutic targets and help to identify biomarkers of the
disease risk.
METHODS: A search was performed in three databases following PRISMA protocol. DNA
methylation in UCC was compared with sporadic colorectal cancer (SCRC), and
individual genes differently methylated in UCC identified.
RESULTS: While there were some similarities in the methylation patterns of UCC
compared with SCRC, generally lower levels of hypermethylation in promoter
regions of individual genes was evident in UCC. Certain individual genes are,
however, highly methylated in colitis-associated cancer: RUNX3, MINT1, MYOD and
p16 exon1 and the promoter regions of EYA4 and ESR.
CONCLUSION: Patterns of DNA methylation differ between UCC and SCRC. Seven genes 
appear to be promising putative biomarkers.

Importance: Small-bowel adenocarcinomas (SBAs) are rare cancers with a
significantly lower incidence, later stage at diagnosis, and worse overall
survival than other intestinal-derived cancers. To date, comprehensive genomic
analysis of SBA is lacking.
Objective: To perform in-depth genomic characterization of a large series of SBAs
and other gastrointestinal tumors to draw comparisons and identify potentially
clinically actionable alterations.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Prospective analysis was performed of clinical
samples from patients with SBA (n = 317), colorectal cancer (n = 6353), and
gastric carcinoma (n = 889) collected between August 24, 2012, and February 3,
2016, using hybrid-capture-based genomic profiling, at the request of the
individual treating physicians in the course of clinical care for the purpose of 
making therapy decisions.
Results: Of the 7559 patients included in analysis, 4138 (54.7%) were male; the
median age was 56 (range, 12-101) years. The frequency of genomic alterations
seen in SBA demonstrated distinct differences in comparison with either
colorectal cancer (APC: 26.8% [85 of 317] vs 75.9% [4823 of 6353], P < .001; and 
CDKN2A: 14.5% [46 of 317] vs 2.6% [165 of 6353], P < .001) or gastric carcinoma
(KRAS: 53.6% [170 of 317] vs 14.2% [126 of 889], P < .001; APC: 26.8% [85 of 317]
vs 7.8% [69 of 889], P < .001; and SMAD4: 17.4% [55 of 317] vs 5.2% [46 of 889], 
P < .001). BRAF was mutated in 7.6% (484 of 6353) of colorectal cancer and 9.1%
(29 of 317) of SBA samples, but V600E mutations were much less common in SBA,
representing only 10.3% (3 of 29) of BRAF-mutated cases. The ERBB2/HER2 point
mutations (8.2% [26 of 317]), microsatellite instability (7.6% [13 of 170]), and 
high tumor mutational burden (9.5% [30 of 317]) were all enriched in SBA.
Significant differences were noted in the molecular profile of unspecified SBA
compared with duodenal adenocarcinoma, as well as in inflammatory bowel
disease-associated SBAs. Targetable alterations in several additional genes,
including PIK3CA and MEK1, and receptor tyrosine kinase fusions, were also
identified in all 3 series.
Conclusions and Relevance: This study presents to our knowledge the first
large-scale genomic comparison of SBA with colorectal cancer and gastric
carcinoma. The distinct genomic differences establish SBA as a molecularly unique
intestinal cancer. In addition, genomic profiling can identify potentially
targetable genomic alterations in the majority of SBA cases (91%), and the higher
incidence of microsatellite instability and tumor mutational burden in SBA
suggests a potential role for immunotherapy.

BACKGROUND: Aberrant gene expression in the gut mucosa might contribute to the
initiation and progression of Crohn's disease (CD). RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)
provides precise measurements of expression levels of transcripts and their
isoforms. The aim of this study was to use RNA-seq to investigate transcriptomic 
differences and identify significantly differentially expressed transcripts in
inflamed and noninflamed intestinal mucosa of CD patients.
METHODS: RNA-seq was performed on 13 pairs of inflamed and noninflamed intestinal
mucosa from 13 CD patients and on sex-matched normal mucosa of 13 healthy
controls. Significantly differentially expressed transcripts were validated by
immunohistochemistry, quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: RNA-seq revealed genome-wide transcriptomic differences between normal
mucosa, noninflamed, and inflamed CD mucosa. Among 950 differentially expressed
genes, 19 were up- or downregulated (upregulation: ANGPT2, CHN1, CPXM1, CPZ,
CXCL1, FCN3, GJC1, HSD11B1, LZTS1, MEOX1, MMP12, PLA1A, SERPINE1, SGIP1, and
TRPC4; downregulation: FAM189A1, PDE6A, SLC38A4, and HMGCS2) with statistical
significance (p < 0.01 and q < 0.05). Among them, CXCL1 exhibited the highest
fold change between groups. Immunohistochemistry for CXCL1 revealed no expression
in normal mucosa, slightly increased expression in noninflamed CD mucosa, and
highly increased expression in inflamed CD mucosa. Quantitative reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction showed that CXCL1 expression was
significantly associated with epithelial damage, increased infiltration of
polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and submucosal fibrosis. Serum CXCL1 concentration 
measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was better correlated with CD
activity index (r = 0.660) than with C-reactive protein (r = 0.204).
CONCLUSIONS: RNA-seq revealed transcriptomic differences between normal mucosa,
noninflamed CD mucosa, and inflamed CD mucosa. Intestinal and serum CXCL1 was
substantially increased with CD activity and can be used as a potential biomarker
of CD.

Intestinal fibrosis is a major complication in inflammatory bowel diseases, but
the regulatory mechanism that inhibits fibrosis remains unclear. Here we
demonstrate that Itch-/-myofibroblasts express increased amounts of profibrotic
collagen type I and α-SMA in response to IL-17. Mechanistically, we demonstrate
that Itch directly binds to HIC-5 and targets it for K63-linked ubiquitination to
inhibit IL-17-driven intestinal fibrosis. Reconstitution of Itch-/-
myofibroblasts with wild-type Itch but not the Itch-C830A mutant normalized the
expression of profibrotic genes. Similarly, shRNA-mediated inhibition of HIC-5
normalized the expression of profibrotic gene expression. Thus, we have uncovered
a novel mechanism by which Itch negatively regulates intestinal fibrosis.

GPBAR1 (TGR5 or M-BAR) is a G protein-coupled receptor for secondary bile acids
that is highly expressed in monocytes/macrophages. In this study, we aimed to
determine the role of GPBAR1 in mediating leukocyte trafficking in chemically
induced models of colitis and investigate the therapeutic potential of BAR501, a 
small molecule agonist for GPBAR1. These studies demonstrated that GPBAR1 gene
ablation enhanced the recruitment of classically activated macrophages in the
colonic lamina propria and worsened the severity of inflammation. In contrast,
GPBAR1 activation by BAR501 reversed intestinal inflammation in the
trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid and oxazolone models by reducing the trafficking of 
Ly6C+ monocytes from blood to intestinal mucosa. Exposure to BAR501 shifted
intestinal macrophages from a classically activated (CD11b+, CCR7+, F4/80-) to an
alternatively activated (CD11b+, CCR7-, F4/80+) phenotype, reduced the expression
of inflammatory genes (TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, and CCL2 mRNAs), and attenuated
the wasting syndrome and severity of colitis (≈70% reduction in the Colitis
Disease Activity Index). The protective effect was lost in Gpbar1-/- mice.
Exposure to BAR501 increased the colonic expression of IL-10 and TGF-β mRNAs and 
the percentage of CD4+/Foxp3+ cells. The beneficial effects of BAR501 were lost
in Il-10-/- mice. In a macrophage cell line, regulation of IL-10 by BAR501 was
GPBAR1 dependent and was mediated by the recruitment of CREB to its responsive
element in the IL-10 promoter. In conclusion, GPBAR1 is expressed in circulating 
monocytes and colonic macrophages, and its activation promotes a IL-10-dependent 
shift toward an alternatively activated phenotype. The targeting of GPBAR1 may
offer therapeutic options in inflammatory bowel diseases.

BACKGROUND: As mechanisms of neoplasia in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC)
remain poorly understood, we sought to identify pathways of carcinogenesis in
this high-risk population.
METHODS: MicroRNA (miRNA) and mRNA expression was examined in nondysplastic
rectosigmoid mucosa from UC patients with (n = 19) or without remote colon
neoplasia (n = 23). We developed a method to identify miRNA-regulated pathways
based on differentially expressed miRNAs and their putative mRNAs targets in the 
same samples. One key pathway identified in the analysis, miR-4728-3p regulation 
of focal adhesion signaling was further evaluated in vitro and through
examination of expression in UC-cancers.
RESULTS: There were 101 significantly up-regulated and 98 down-regulated miRNAs
(adjusted P < 0.05) in the rectal mucosa of UC patients harboring proximal
neoplasia. Bioinformatic analysis identified miR-4728-3p as a regulator of 3
proteins involved in focal adhesion signaling, CAV1, THBS2, and COL1A2. Real-time
PCR validated down-regulation of miR-4728-3p in nondysplastic tissue remote from 
UC-neoplasia and in UC-associated colon cancers. miR-4728-3p transfection into
colon cancer cells down-regulated expression levels and decreased luciferase
activities in cells expressing a wild type 3' untranslated region compared with a
mutant 3' untranslated region for all 3 genes. Exogenous transfected miR-4728-3p 
also delayed wound healing and decreased formation of focal adhesion complexes.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with long-standing UC who harbor neoplasia can be
identified based on miRNA and mRNA profiles in nondysplastic tissue. Using a
method to analyze miRNA and mRNA expression from the same tissues, we identified 
that miR-4728-3p is likely an important tumor suppressor in UC-associated colon
carcinogenesis.

BACKGROUND: Although anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents are effective in
patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), many patients either do not
respond to anti-TNF treatment or lose response over time. The aim of this study
was to determine factors associated with response to anti-TNF therapy in IBD.
METHODS: Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis who had
consented to participate in a genetics registry and been treated with anti-TNF
agents were evaluated retrospectively and categorized as primary nonresponders or
secondary nonresponders. We evaluated clinical, serological, and genetic
characteristics associated with primary nonresponse or time to loss of response
to anti-TNF agents.
RESULTS: We included 314 CD (51 [16.2%] primary nonresponders and 179 [57.0%]
secondary nonresponders) and 145 subjects with ulcerative colitis (43 [29.7%]
primary nonresponders and 74 [51.0%] secondary nonresponders). Colonic
involvement (P = 0.017; odds ratio = 8.0) and anti-TNF monotherapy (P = 0.017;
odds ratio = 4.9) were associated in a multivariate analysis with primary
nonresponse to anti-TNF agents in CD. In addition, higher anti-nuclear
cytoplasmic antibody levels (P = 0.019; hazard ratio = 1.01) in CD, anti-nuclear 
cytoplasmic antibody positivity (P = 0.038; hazard ratio = 1.6) in ulcerative
colitis, and a positive family history of IBD (P = 0.044; hazard ratio = 1.3) in 
all patients with IBD were associated with time to loss of response to anti-TNF
agents. Furthermore, various known IBD susceptibility single-nucleotide
polymorphisms and additional variants in immune-mediated genes were shown to be
associated with primary nonresponse or time to loss of response.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results may help to optimize the use of anti-TNF agents in
clinical practice and position these therapies appropriately as clinicians strive
for a more personalized approach to managing IBD.

Exosomes secreted by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have shown repairing effects
on several tissue injury diseases. In this study, we aimed to investigate the
effects of exosomes released from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells
(hucMSCs) on the treatment of dextran sulfate sodium- (DSS-) induced inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD) and to explore the underlying mechanism. We found that
indocyanine green (ICG) labeled exosomes homed to colon tissues of IBD mice at 12
hours after injection. Exosomes significantly relieved the severity of IBD in
mice as hucMSCs. The expression of IL-10 gene was increased while that of TNF-α, 
IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, and IL-7 genes was decreased in the colon tissues and spleens 
of exosomes-treated mice. Furthermore, the infiltration of macrophages into the
colon tissues was decreased by exosome treatment in IBD mice. In addition, we
provided evidence that in vitro coculture with exosomes inhibited the expression 
of iNOS and IL-7 in mouse enterocoelia macrophages. Moreover, we found that the
expression of IL-7 was higher in the colon tissues of colitis patients than that 
of healthy controls. Our findings suggest that exosomes from hucMSCs have
profound effects on alleviating DSS-induced IBD and may exert their impact
through the modulation of IL-7 expression in macrophages.

Importance: Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and pathway analyses
supported long-standing observations of an association between immune-mediated
diseases and Parkinson disease (PD). The post-GWAS era provides an opportunity
for cross-phenotype analyses between different complex phenotypes.
Objectives: To test the hypothesis that there are common genetic risk variants
conveying risk of both PD and autoimmune diseases (ie, pleiotropy) and to
identify new shared genetic variants and their pathways by applying a novel
statistical framework in a genome-wide approach.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Using the conjunction false discovery rate
method, this study analyzed GWAS data from a selection of archetypal autoimmune
diseases among 138 511 individuals of European ancestry and systemically
investigated pleiotropy between PD and type 1 diabetes, Crohn disease, ulcerative
colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, celiac disease, psoriasis, and multiple sclerosis.
NeuroX data (6927 PD cases and 6108 controls) were used for replication. The
study investigated the biological correlation between the top loci through
protein-protein interaction and changes in the gene expression and methylation
levels. The dates of the analysis were June 10, 2015, to March 4, 2017.
Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was a list of novel loci and
their pathways involved in PD and autoimmune diseases.
Results: Genome-wide conjunctional analysis identified 17 novel loci at false
discovery rate less than 0.05 with overlap between PD and autoimmune diseases,
including known PD loci adjacent to GAK, HLA-DRB5, LRRK2, and MAPT for rheumatoid
arthritis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease. Replication confirmed the
involvement of HLA, LRRK2, MAPT, TRIM10, and SETD1A in PD. Among the novel genes 
discovered, WNT3, KANSL1, CRHR1, BOLA2, and GUCY1A3 are within a protein-protein 
interaction network with known PD genes. A subset of novel loci was significantly
associated with changes in methylation or expression levels of adjacent genes.
Conclusions and Relevance: The study findings provide novel mechanistic insights 
into PD and autoimmune diseases and identify a common genetic pathway between
these phenotypes. The results may have implications for future therapeutic trials
involving anti-inflammatory agents.

Interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) is a key transcription factor of innate
immunity, which plays an important role in host restriction to viral infection
and inflammation. Genome-wide association studies have implied the association of
IRF5 with several autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus
(SLE), Sjogren's syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis.
However, the regulation of IRF5-mediated immunity is not well understood. To
uncover new regulators in IRF5 pathway, we used two "omics" approaches: affinity 
purification coupled with mass spectrometry and a high throughput RNAi screen.
Proteomics identified 16 new IRF5 interactors while RNAi-mediated knockdown found
43 regulators of the TLR7-dependent IRF5 signaling pathway. NXF1 was identified
in both screens. Stimulation with TLR7 ligand enhances formation of IRF5-NXF1
protein complexes. Gain or loss-of-function experiments revealed NXF1 selectively
regulates TLR7-driven IRF5 transcriptional activity, suggesting a new role for
NXF1 in the IRF5 signaling pathway.

Cytosolic pattern recognition receptors play key roles in innate immune response.
Nucleotide binding and oligomerisation domain containing protein 1 (NOD1)
belonging to the Nod-like receptor C (NLRC) sub-family of Nod-like receptors
(NLRs) is important for detection and clearance of intra-cellular Gram negative
bacteria. NOD1 is involved in activation of pro-inflammatory pathways. Limited
structural data is available for NOD1. Using different templates for each domain 
of NOD1, we determined the full-length homology model of NOD1. ADP binding amino 
acids within the nucleotide binding domain (NBD) of NOD1 were also predicted. Key
residues in inter-domain interaction were identified by sequence comparison with 
Oryctolagus cuniculus NOD2, a related protein. Interactions between NBD and
winged helix domain (WHD) were found to be conserved in NOD1. Functional and
structural effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms within the NOD1 NBD domain
associated with susceptibility risk to Ulcerative colitis (UC), an inflammatory
disorder of the colon was evaluated by in silico studies. Mutations W219R and
L349P were predicted to be damaging and disease associated by prediction programs
SIFT, PolyPhen2, PANTHER, SNP&GO, PhD SNP and SNAP2. We further validated the
effect of W219R and L349P mutation on NOD1 function in vitro. Elevated mRNA
expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL8 and IL-1β was seen as compared to
the wild type NOD1 in intestinal epithelial cell line HT29 when stimulated with
NOD1 ligand. Thus, these mutations may indeed have a bearing on pathogenesis of
inflammation during UC.

SLC26A3 [downregulated in adenoma (DRA)] plays a key role in mammalian intestinal
NaCl absorption, in that it mediates apical membrane Cl-/[Formula: see text]
exchange. DRA function and expression are significantly decreased in diarrhea
associated with inflammatory bowel disease. DRA is also considered to be a marker
of cellular differentiation and is predominantly expressed in differentiated
epithelial cells. Caudal-type homeobox protein-2 (CDX2) is known to regulate
genes involved in intestinal epithelial differentiation and proliferation.
Reduced expression of both DRA and CDX2 in intestinal inflammation prompted us to
study whether the DRA gene is directly regulated by CDX2. Our initial studies
utilizing CDX2 knockout (CDX2fV/fV;Cre+) mice showed a marked reduction in DRA
mRNA and protein levels in proximal and distal colon. In silico analysis of the
DRA promoter showed two consensus sites for CDX2 binding. Therefore, we utilized 
Caco-2 cells as an in vitro model to examine if DRA is a direct target of CDX2
regulation. siRNA-mediated silencing of CDX2 in Caco-2 cells resulted in a marked
(~50%) decrease in DRA mRNA and protein levels, whereas ectopic overexpression of
CDX2 upregulated DRA expression and also stimulated DRA promoter activity,
suggesting transcriptional regulation. Electrophoretic mobility shift and
chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated direct binding of CDX2 to one
of the two putative CDX2 binding sites in the DRA promoter (+645/+663). In
summary, our studies, for the first time, demonstrate transcriptional regulation 
of DRA expression by CDX2, implying that reduced expression of DRA in
inflammatory bowel disease-associated diarrhea may, in part, be due to
downregulation of CDX2 in the inflamed mucosa.NEW & NOTEWORTHY SLC26A3
[downregulated in adenoma (DRA)] mediates intestinal luminal NaCl absorption and 
is downregulated in inflammatory bowel disease-associated diarrhea. Since both
DRA and caudal-type homeobox protein-2 (CDX2) are reduced in intestinal
inflammation and the DRA promoter harbors CDX2 binding sites, we examined whether
the DRA gene is regulated by CDX2. Our studies, for the first time, demonstrate
transcriptional regulation of DRA expression by CDX2 via direct binding to the
DRA promoter, suggesting that reduced expression of DRA in inflammatory bowel
disease-associated diarrhea could, in part, be attributed to downregulation of
CDX2.

BACKGROUND: Objective control of intestinal inflammation during inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD) is becoming the main driver for medical treatment. However,
the monitoring tools-related burden remains poorly investigated. We aimed to
evaluate their comparative acceptability and utility according to patients with
IBD.
METHODS: After a preliminary phase, the final questionnaire encompassing
self-administered and physician questionnaires was prospectively and
consecutively submitted to 916 patients with IBD from 20 public and private
centers. Acceptability and utility visual analog scales (VAS) were expressed as
median with interquartile range.
RESULTS: Regarding the group of patients with Crohn's disease (n = 618),
venipuncture (VAS = 9.3 [8.8-9.7]) and ultrasonography (VAS = 9.3 [8.7-9.7]) were
the most acceptable tools (P < 0.0001, for each comparison), whereas
rectosigmoidoscopy was the least acceptable tool (VAS = 4.4 [1.2-7.3]) (P <
0.0001, for each comparison). Wireless capsule endoscopy (VAS = 8.5 [5.2-9.3]),
magnetic resonance enterocolonography (VAS = 8.0 [5.0-9.2]), and stools
collection (VAS = 7.7 [4.6-9.3]) were more acceptable than colonoscopy (VAS = 6.7
[4.3-8.9]) (P < 0.0001, for each comparison). The acceptability was assessed in
298 patients with ulcerative colitis for venipuncture (VAS = 9.4 [8.8-9.7]),
stools collection (VAS = 8.1 [5.7-9.4]), colonoscopy (VAS = 7.5 [4.7-9.2]), and
rectosigmoidoscopy (VAS = 6.7 [2.8-9.1]); (P < 0.001 for each comparison). All
monitoring tools were considered as highly useful by patients with IBD. Decreased
acceptability was related to embarrassment for the collection/transport of stools
(60.7%), bowel cleansing (76.3%) for colonoscopy, abdominal discomfort (51.3%)
and rectal enema (36.6%) for rectosigmoidoscopy, bowel distension (48.3%) for
magnetic resonance enterocolonography, and potential capsule retention (21.4%)
for wireless capsule endoscopy.
CONCLUSIONS: Among the IBD monitoring tools, endoscopy demonstrated the lowest
acceptability supporting the development of alternative modalities. Patients'
information and examination conditions should be improved to ensure proper
monitoring adherence.

One third of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) inadequately respond 
to anti-TNF treatment and preclinical data suggest that matrix
metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is a novel therapeutic target. Here we show that IBD 
clinical and histopathological parameters found in wild type mice challenged with
three different models of colitis, acute and chronic dextran sodium sulphate
(DSS), and acute 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced colitis are not
attenuated in MMP-9 knockout mice. We find similar colonic gene expression
profiles in wild type and MMP-9 knockout mice in control and acute DSS conditions
with the exception of eleven genes involved in antimicrobial response during
colitis. Parameters of chronic colitis are similar in wild type and MMP-9
knockout mice. Pharmacological inhibition of MMP-9 with bio-active peptides does 
not improve DSS colitis. We suggest that MMP-9 upregulation is a consequence
rather than a cause of intestinal inflammation and we question whether MMP-9
represents a disease target in IBD.

Aberrant DNA methylation patterns have been reported in inflamed tissues and may 
play a role in disease. We studied DNA methylation and gene expression profiles
of purified intestinal epithelial cells from ulcerative colitis patients,
comparing inflamed and non-inflamed areas of the colon. We identified 577
differentially methylated sites (false discovery rate <0.2) mapping to 210 genes.
From gene expression data from the same epithelial cells, we identified 62
differentially expressed genes with increased expression in the presence of
inflammation at prostate cancer susceptibility genes PRAC1 and PRAC2. Four genes 
showed inverse correlation between methylation and gene expression; ROR1, GXYLT2,
FOXA2, and, notably, RARB, a gene previously identified as a tumor suppressor in 
colorectal adenocarcinoma as well as breast, lung and prostate cancer. We
highlight targeted and specific patterns of DNA methylation and gene expression
in epithelial cells from inflamed colon, while challenging the importance of
epithelial cells in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammation.

Phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4 is a superfamily of enzymes that catalyze the
hydrolysis of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP), an intracellular
second messenger and regulator of a wide array of genes and proteins. Increased
levels of intracellular cAMP lead to activation of genes but also to inhibition
of nuclear factor-kappa B, involved in pro-inflammatory responses. By increasing 
cAMP levels, PDE4 inhibitors, such as apremilast, reduced production of
pro-inflammatory TNFα, IFNγ, and IL-17 and increased production of
anti-inflammatory IL-10 in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated peripheral blood
mononuclear cells, and in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Among PDE4
inhibitors, apremilast, roflumilast, and crisabolore have been approved for the
treatment of psoriasis and PsA, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and atopic
dermatitis, respectively. In a preliminary study on psoriasis and PsA we showed
that at 6 months apremilast decreased IFNγ+CD3+ Th1 cells and IL- 17+CD3+ Th17
cells and increased regulatory B cells and regulatory T cells. In this review, we
highlight recent findings of PDE4 inhibitors in atopic dermatitis, alopecia
areata, uveitis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and PsA, systemic lupus
erythematosus, vasculitis, systemic sclerosis, multiple sclerosis and
inflammatory bowel disease. Given the role of cAMP as second messenger in diverse
intracellular pathways, selective PDE4 inhibitors are likely to be therapeutic
agents for various immune mediated diseases.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the
gastrointestinal tract caused by a dysregulated immune response to the fecal
microbiota. Very early-onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD) refers to a
subgroup of pediatric patients with IBD diagnosed before 6 years of age. This
subgroup is often characterized by increased severity, aggressive progression,
strong family history of IBD, and often poor response to conventional treatments.
Nutritional therapies have been utilized to treat IBD, but their role in VEO-IBD 
is unclear. Disease behavior in VEO-IBD is often different from disease in
adolescents and adults, as it is often restricted to the colon and refractory to 
standard medical therapies. Up to 25% of VEO-IBD patients have an identified
underlying immunodeficiency, which may impact response to therapy. While specific
mutations in interleukin 10 (IL-10), the IL-10 receptor (IL-10R), and mutations
in NCF2, XIAP, LRBA, and TTC7 have been identified in VEO-IBD, polymorphisms in
these genes are also associated with increased risk of developing IBD in
adolescence or adulthood. We describe two cases in which infants presenting with 
VEO-IBD achieved clinical remission using exclusive enteral nutrition, a
formula-based diet which has been shown to induce remission in older children
with active Crohn's disease.

BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with increased
intestinal permeability, which involves paracellular passage regulated through
tight junctions (TJ). The aim of the study was to investigate single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNP) located in genes encoding interacting TJ proteins and
corresponding expressions, in relation to IBD.
METHODS: Allelic associations between TJ-related genes (F11R, MAGI1, MAGI2,
MAGI3, PARD3, PTEN, and TJP1) and IBD, Crohn's disease (CD), or ulcerative
colitis (UC) were investigated. PTPN22 was included since it's located in the
same genetic region as MAGI3. Gene expression levels were investigated in
relation to genotype, inflammatory status, phenotype, and medical treatment.
RESULTS: The two strongest allelic associations were observed between IBD and
SNPs in MAGI2 (rs6962966) and MAGI3 (rs1343126). Another MAGI3 SNP marker
(rs6689879) contributed to increased ileal MAGI3 expression level in non-IBD
controls. Furthermore, association between inflammation and decreased expression 
levels of MAGI3, PTEN, and TJP1 in colonic IBD as well as UC mucosa, and between 
inflammation and increased expression of PTPN22 in colonic IBD mucosa, was
observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings lend support to a genetic basis for modulation of
intestinal epithelial barrier in IBD, and we have identified MAGI3 as a new
candidate gene for IBD.

Nucleic acid-based therapeutics has the potential for treating numerous diseases 
by correcting abnormal expression of specific genes. Lack of safe and efficacious
delivery strategies poses a major obstacle limiting clinical advancement of
nucleic acid therapeutics. Oral route of drug administration has greater delivery
challenges, because the administered genes or oligonucleotides have to bypass
degrading environment of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in addition to
overcoming other cellular barriers preventing nucleic acid delivery. For
efficient oral nucleic acid delivery, vector should be such that it can protect
encapsulated material during transit through the GI tract, facilitate efficient
uptake and intracellular trafficking at desired target sites, along with being
safe and well tolerated. In this review, we have discussed multicompartmental
systems for overcoming extracellular and intracellular barriers to oral delivery 
of nucleic acids. A nanoparticles-in-microsphere oral system-based
multicompartmental system was developed and tested for in vivo gene and small
interfering RNA delivery for treating colitis in mice. This system has shown
efficient transgene expression or gene silencing when delivered orally along with
favorable downstream anti-inflammatory effects, when tested in a mouse model of
intestinal bowel disease. WIREs Nanomed Nanobiotechnol 2018, 10:e1478. doi:

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by multigenic inheritance.
Defects in autophagy related genes are considered to show genetic heterogeneity
between populations. We evaluated the association of several single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in the autophagy related 16 like 1 (ATG16L1) gene with IBD
in Indians. The ATG16L1 gene was genotyped for ten different SNPs using DNA
extracted from peripheral blood of 234 patients with Crohn's disease (CD), 249
patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 393 healthy controls The SNPs
rs2241880, rs4663396, rs3792106, rs10210302, rs3792109, rs2241877, rs6737398,
rs11682898, rs4663402 and rs4663421 were genotyped using the Sequenom MassArray
platform. PLINK was used for the association analysis and pairwise linkage
disequilibrium (LD) values. Haplotype analysis was done using Haploview. All SNPs
were in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium in cases and controls. The G allele at
rs6737398 exhibited a protective association with both CD and UC. The T allele at
rs4663402 and C allele at rs4663421 were positively associated with CD and UC.
The T allele at rs2241877 exhibited protective association with UC only. The AA
genotype at rs4663402 and the GG genotype at rs4663421 were protectively
associated with both CD and UC. Haplotype analysis revealed that all the SNPs in 
tight LD (D' = 0.76-1.0) and organized in a single haplotype block. Haplotype D
was positively associated with IBD (P = 5.8 x 10-6 for CD and 0.002 for UC). SNPs
in ATG16L1 were associated with IBD in Indian patients. The relevance to
management of individual patients requires further study.

Th17 cells play a role as an inflammation mediator in a variety of autoimmune
disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease, and thus are widely considered
to be pathogenic. However, Th17 cells are present in the normal intestine and
show a homeostatic phenotype; that is, they participate in the maintenance of
intestinal homeostasis rather than inducing inflammation. We observed an enlarged
Th17 population in the small intestine of C57BL/6.IgA-/- mice compared with
wild-type mice, which was further amplified with cholera toxin (CT) immunization 
without causing intestinal inflammation. The increased Th17 induction and the
correspondingly 10-fold higher CT B subunit-specific serum IgG response in IgA-/-
mice after CT immunization was microbiota dependent and was associated with
increased segmented filamentous bacteria in the small intestine of IgA-/- mice.
Oral administration of vancomycin greatly dampened both CT immunogenicity and
adjuvanticity, and the differential CT responses in IgA-/- and wild-type mice
disappeared after intestinal microbiota equalization. Using gnotobiotic mouse
models, we found that CT induction of homeostatic intestinal Th17 responses was
supported not only by segmented filamentous bacteria, but also by other commensal
bacteria. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis using IL-17AhCD2 reporter mice
revealed a similar gene expression profile in CT-induced intestinal Th17 cells
and endogenous intestinal Th17 cells at homeostasis, with upregulated expression 
of a panel of immune-regulatory genes, which was distinctly different from the
gene expression profile of pathogenic Th17 cells. Taken together, we identified a
nonpathogenic signature of intestinal homeostatic Th17 cells, which are actively 
regulated by the commensal microbiota and can be selectively stimulated by CT.

Chronic inflammation influences the development of various cancers including
colorectal cancer (CRC). Interleukin-10 (IL-10), an anti-inflammatory cytokine,
plays a vital role in several homeostatic physiological processes occurring in
the human gastrointestinal tract including intestinal inflammation and is a key
regulator of several gastrointestinal tract pathophysiological processes such as 
inflammatory bowel diseases that are associated with an increased predisposition 
to CRC. Several studies have reported the association of various polymorphisms in
the human IL-10 gene including IL-10 -592C/A and IL-10 -1082A/G single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) with various cancers including CRC, but these SNPs are yet
to be studied in a Kashmiri population with respect to CRC risk. The aim of this 
study was to analyze the association of IL-10 -592C/A and IL-10 -1082A/G promoter
SNPs with CRC risk in an ethnic Kashmiri population through a case-control
design. The genotype frequencies of IL-10 -592C/A and IL-10 -1082A/G promoter
SNPs were compared between 142 CRC patients and 184 individually matched healthy 
controls using the PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism method. The
association between the IL-10 -592C/A and IL-10 -1082A/G SNPs and CRC risk was
examined through conditional logistic regression models adjusted for multiple
possible confounding (third) variables. The possible effect measure modification 
of the association between the relevant SNP genotypes and CRC risk by various CRC
risk factors including age, sex, and smoking status was also evaluated. Further, 
the associations between these SNPs and various clinicopathological parameters,
demographic variables, and environmental factors in the case group patients with 
respect to CRC risk were also analyzed. The overall association between the IL-10
-592C/A SNP and the modulation of CRC risk was found to be significant (P=0.001).
The variant genotype (AA) was significantly associated with a decreased risk of
CRC (odds ratio: 0.25; 95% confidence interval: 0.11-0.61; P=0.002). Further, the
less common IL-10 -592A allele was associated with a decreased risk of CRC (odds 
ratio: 0.64; 95% confidence interval: 0.46-0.88; P=0.0092). The overall
association between the IL-10 -1082A/G SNP and the modulation of CRC risk was not
found to be significant (P=0.141). This study has shown that there is a
significant association between the IL-10 -592C/A promoter SNP and a decreased
risk of CRC in an ethnic Kashmiri population, but the association between IL-10
-1082A/G SNP and the risk of CRC in the population under study is not
significant. However, to substantiate our findings, this study needs to be
replicated with a larger sample size and with other ethnically defined
populations with comparable CRC incidence.

Most genetic variants identified in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of
complex traits are thought to act by affecting gene regulation rather than
directly altering the protein product. As a consequence, the actual genes
involved in disease are not necessarily the most proximal to the associated
variants. By integrating data from GWAS analyses with those from genetic studies 
of regulatory variation, it is possible to identify variants pleiotropically
associated with both a complex trait and measures of gene regulation. In this
study, we used summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR), a method
developed to identify variants pleiotropically associated with both complex
traits and gene expression, to identify variants associated with complex traits
and DNA methylation. We used large DNA methylation quantitative trait locus
(mQTL) datasets generated from two different tissues (blood and fetal brain) to
prioritize genes for >40 complex traits with robust GWAS data and found
considerable overlap with the results of SMR analyses performed with expression
QTL (eQTL) data. We identified multiple examples of variable DNA methylation
associated with GWAS variants for a range of complex traits, demonstrating the
utility of this approach for refining genetic association signals.

BACKGROUND: Inhibition of the nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-κβ) pathway has been 
proposed as a therapeutic target due to its key role in the expression of
pro-inflammatory genes, including pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and
adhesion molecules. Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) is a naturally occurring 
anti-inflammatory agent, found in propolis, and has been reported as a specific
inhibitor of NF-κβ. However, the impact of CAPE on levels of myeloperoxidases
(MPO) and pro-inflammatory cytokines during inflammation is not clear. The aims
of this study were to investigate the protective efficacy of CAPE in the mouse
model of colitis and determine its effect on MPO activity, pro-inflammatory
cytokines levels, and intestinal permeability.
METHOD: Dextran sulphate sodium was administered in drinking water to induce
colitis in C57/BL6 mice before treatment with intraperitoneal administration of
CAPE (30 mg kg-1 day-1). Disease activity index (DAI) score, colon length and
tissue histology levels of MPO, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and intestinal
permeability were observed.
RESULTS: CAPE-treated mice had lower DAI and tissue inflammation scores, with
improved epithelial barrier protection and significant reduction in the level of 
MPO and pro-inflammatory cytokines.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that CAPE is effective in suppressing
inflammation-triggered MPO activity and pro-inflammatory cytokines production
while enhancing epithelial barrier function in experimental colitis. Thus, we
conclude that CAPE could be a potential therapeutic agent for further clinical
investigations for treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases in humans.

BACKGROUND: Long-standing ulcerative colitis (UC) leading to colorectal cancer
(CRC) is one of the most serious and life-threatening consequences acknowledged
globally. Ulcerative colitis-associated colorectal carcinogenesis showed distinct
molecular alterations when compared with sporadic colorectal carcinoma.
METHODS: Targeted sequencing of 409 genes in tissue samples of 18 long-standing
UC subjects at high risk of colorectal carcinoma (UCHR) was performed to identify
somatic driver mutations, which may be involved in the molecular changes during
the transformation of non-dysplastic mucosa to high-grade dysplasia. Findings
from the study are also compared with previously published genome wide and exome 
sequencing data in inflammatory bowel disease-associated and sporadic colorectal 
carcinoma.
RESULTS: Next-generation sequencing analysis identified 1107 mutations in 275
genes in UCHR subjects. In addition to TP53 (17%) and KRAS (22%) mutations,
recurrent mutations in APC (33%), ACVR2A (61%), ARID1A (44%), RAF1 (39%) and MTOR
(61%) were observed in UCHR subjects. In addition, APC, FGFR3, FGFR2 and PIK3CA
driver mutations were identified in UCHR subjects. Recurrent mutations in ARID1A 
(44%), SMARCA4 (17%), MLL2 (44%), MLL3 (67%), SETD2 (17%) and TET2 (50%) genes
involved in histone modification and chromatin remodelling were identified in
UCHR subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study identifies new oncogenic driver mutations which may be
involved in the transition of non-dysplastic cells to dysplastic phenotype in the
subjects with long-standing UC with high risk of progression into colorectal
neoplasia.

Obesity is a risk factor for developing inflammatory bowel disease. Pea is unique
with its high content of dietary fiber, polyphenolics, and glycoproteins, all of 
which are known to be health beneficial. We aimed to investigate the impact of
green pea (GP) supplementation on the susceptibility of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed
mice to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. Six-week-old C57BL/6J
female mice were fed a 45% HFD or HFD supplemented with 10% GP. After 7-week
dietary supplementation, colitis was induced by adding 2.5% DSS in drinking water
for 7 days followed by a 7-day recovery period. GP supplementation ameliorated
the disease activity index score in HFD-fed mice during the recovery stage, and
reduced neutrophil infiltration, mRNA expression of monocyte chemoattractant
protein-1 (MCP-1) and inflammatory markers interleukin (IL)-6, cyclooxygenase-2
(COX-2), IL-17, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) 
in HFD-fed mice. Further, GP supplementation increased mucin 2 content and mRNA
expression of goblet cell differentiation markers including Trefoil factor 3
(Tff3), Krüppel-like factor 4 (Klf4), and SAM pointed domain ETS factor 1
(Spdef1) in HFD-fed mice. In addition, GP ameliorated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 
stress as indicated by the reduced expression of Activating transcription
factor-6 (ATF-6) protein and its target genes chaperone protein glucose-regulated
protein 78 (Grp78), the CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP),
the ER degradation-enhancing α-mannosidase-like 1 protein (Edem1), and the X-box 
binding protein 1 (Xbp1) in HFD-fed mice. In conclusion, GP supplementation
ameliorated the severity of DSS-induced colitis in HFD-fed mice, which was
associated with the suppression of inflammation, mucin depletion, and ER stress
in the colon.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic, recurrent, and remitting
inflammatory disease with unclear etiology. As a clinically frequent disease, it 
can affect individuals throughout their lives, with multiple complications.
Unfortunately, traditional murine models are not efficient for the further study 
of IBD. Thus, effective and convenient animal models are needed. Zebrafish have
been used as model organisms to investigate IBD because of their suggested highly
genetic similarity to humans and their superiority as laboratory models. The
zebrafish model has been used to study the composition of intestinal microbiota, 
novel genes, and therapeutic approaches. The pathogenesis of IBD is still unclear
and many risk factors remain unidentified. In this review, we compare traditional
murine models and zebrafish models in terms of advantages, pathogenesis, and drug
discovery screening for IBD. We also review the progress and deficiencies of the 
zebrafish model for scientific applications.

A review of six methods for monitoring infliximab concentrations and antibodies
to infliximab .

Cao F, Cao H, Cao X.

Anti-TNF-α therapy, such as infliximab (IFX), has profoundly changed treatment to
induce and maintain remission for inflammatory bowel diseases patients who do not
respond to conventional therapies. Unfortunately, IFX, as a chimeric protein, is 
potentially immunogenic, and antibodies to infliximab (ATI) may interfere with
the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of the drug, thus resulting in a loss
of response for a substantial proportion of patients. The clinical efficacy of
IFX is correlated with the levels of IFX and ATI. Therefore, monitoring patients 
for the trough levels of IFX and the presence of ATI is very important. The
procedures and characteristics of six assays for monitoring IFX and ATI are
described in this review, and the comparisons between them are also discussed. To
date, there has been no optimal assay for monitoring IFX and ATI. Therefore, many
technical problems need to be solved to make therapeutic drug and immunogenicity 
monitoring a part of routine clinical management. .

BACKGROUND & AIMS: The role of tobacco smoke in the etiology of inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD) is unclear. We investigated interactions between genes and
smoking (gene-smoking interactions) that affect risk for Crohn's disease (CD) and
ulcerative colitis (UC) in a case-only study of patients and in mouse models of
IBD.
METHODS: We used 55 Immunochip-wide datasets that included 19,735 IBD cases
(10,856 CD cases and 8879 UC cases) of known smoking status. We performed 3
meta-analyses each for CD, UC, and IBD (CD and UC combined), comparing data for
never vs ever smokers, never vs current smokers, and never vs former smokers. We 
studied the effects of exposure to cigarette smoke in Il10-/- and Nod2-/- mice,
as well as in Balb/c mice without disruption of these genes (wild-type mice).
Mice were exposed to the smoke of 5 cigarettes per day, 5 days a week, for 8
weeks, in a ventilated smoking chamber, or ambient air (controls). Intestines
were collected and analyzed histologically and by reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: We identified 64 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for which the
association between the SNP and IBD were modified by smoking behavior
(meta-analysis Wald test P < 5.0 × 10-5; heterogeneity Cochrane Q test P > .05). 
Twenty of these variants were located within the HLA region at 6p21. Analysis of 
classical HLA alleles (imputed from SNP genotypes) revealed an interaction with
smoking. We replicated the interaction of a variant in NOD2 with current smoking 
in relation to the risk for CD (frameshift variant fs1007insC; rs5743293). We
identified 2 variants in the same genomic region (rs2270368 and rs17221417) that 
interact with smoking in relation to CD risk. Approximately 45% of the SNPs that 
interact with smoking were in close vicinity (≤1 Mb) to SNPs previously
associated with IBD; many were located near or within genes that regulate mucosal
barrier function and immune tolerance. Smoking modified the disease risk of some 
variants in opposite directions for CD vs UC. Exposure of Interleukin 10
(il10)-deficient mice to cigarette smoke accelerated development of colitis and
increased expression of interferon gamma in the small intestine compared to
wild-type mice exposed to smoke. NOD2-deficient mice exposed to cigarette smoke
developed ileitis, characterized by increased expression of interferon gamma,
compared to wild-type mice exposed to smoke.
CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of 55 Immunochip-wide datasets, we identified 64 SNPs
whose association with risk for IBD is modified by tobacco smoking. Gene-smoking 
interactions were confirmed in mice with disruption of Il10 and Nod2-variants of 
these genes have been associated with risk for IBD. Our findings from mice and
humans revealed that the effects of smoking on risk for IBD depend on genetic
variants.

Very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD) is a unique disease entity 
with a complex genetic susceptibility in affected patients. Next-generation gene 
sequencing techniques have revealed various monogenetic mutations contributing to
the pathogenesis of VEO-IBD, including interleukin 10 (IL-10) and IL-10 receptor 
(IL-10R) mutations. In this article, we reviewed the features of and effective
therapeutic options for VEO-IBD with IL-10 and/or IL-10R mutations. The IL-10
signal pathway inhibits the release of several key cytokines and thereby has a
significant anti-inflammatory effect in the gastrointestinal tract. Mutations of 
the genes encoding IL-10 and/or IL-10R have been detected in VEO-IBD patients
among myriad populations throughout the world. VEO-IBD patients with IL-10 or
IL-10R mutations often present with repeated bouts of bloody diarrhea, marked
weight loss, growth retardation, and recurrent perianal problems, including
abscesses, fistulas, and significant fissures. Moreover, some patients may have
folliculitis and present with pulmonary infections. While the therapeutic
efficacy of immunosuppressants is typically poor in these patients, allogeneic
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been reported to improve
symptoms significantly. However, the long-term prognosis of VEO-IBD patients with
IL-10 or IL-10R gene mutations treated with HSCT requires further exploration to 
verify the efficacy and safety of this treatment. We concluded that clinicians
should recognize the clinical phenotype of VEO-IBD, as mutational analysis of the
IL-10 pathway can support the diagnosis and prompt early treatment of this
complicated disease.

Crohn's Disease (CD) is a relapsing inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract
that affects a young working age population and is increasing in developing
countries. Half of all sufferers will experience stricturing or fistulizing
intestinal complications that require extensive surgical interventions and
neither genes nor clinical risk factors can predict this debilitating natural
history. We applied discovery and verification phase studies as part of an
NCI-FDA modeled biomarker pipeline to identify differences in the low-mass
(<25kDa) blood-serum proteome between CD behavioral phenotypes. A significant
enrichment of epithelial component proteins was identified in CD patients with
intestinal complications using quantitative proteomic profiling with label-free
Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). DAVID 6.7 (NIH) was
used for functional annotation analysis of detected proteins and immunoblotting
and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) to verify a priori findings in a secondary
independent cohort of complicated CD (CCD), uncomplicated inflammatory CD (ICD), 
Th1/17 pathway inflammation controls (rheumatoid arthritis), inflammatory bowel
disease controls (ulcerative colitis), and healthy controls. Seventy-six
high-confidence serum proteins were modulated in CCD versus ICD by LC-MS/MS (p < 
0.05, FDR q<0.01), annotating to pathways of epithelial barrier homeostasis (p < 
0.01). In verification phase, a putative serology panel developed from discovery 
proteomics data consisting of desmoglein-1, desmoplakin, and fatty acid-binding
protein 5 (FABP5) distinguished CCD from all other groups (p = 0.041) and
discriminated complication in CD (70% sensitivity and 72.5% specificity at score 
≥1.907, AUC = 0.777, p = 0.007). An MRM assay secondarily confirmed increased
FABP5 levels in CCD (p < 0.001). In a longitudinal subanalysis-cohort, FABP5
levels were stable over a two-month period with no behavioral changes (p =
0.099). These studies along the biomarker development pipeline provide
substantial proof-of-principle that a blood test can be developed specific to
transmural intestinal injury. Data are available via the PRIDE proteomics data
repository under identifier PXD001821 and PeptideAtlas with identifier PASS00661.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is induced by multiple environmental factors,
and there is still no known treatment capable of curing the disease completely.
We propose a zeolite-containing mixture (Hydryeast®, HY)-a multi-component
nutraceutical of which the main ingredients are Azumaceramics (mixture of zeolite
and oyster shell burned under high temperature), citric acid, red rice yeast
(monascus) and calcium stearate-as a nutraceutical intervention in IBD to
ameliorate dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. We show the mechanism
through integrated omics using transcriptomics and proteomics. C57BL6 mice were
given an AIN-93G basal diet or a 0.8% HY containing diet and sterilized tap water
for 11 days. Colitis was then induced by 1.5% (w/v) DSS-containing water for 9
days. HY fed mice showed significantly improved disease activity index and colon 
length compared to DSS mice. Colonic mucosa microarray analysis plus RT-PCR
results indicate HY supplementation may ameliorate inflammation by inhibiting the
intestinal inflammatory pathway and suppress apoptosis by curbing the expression 
of genes like tumor protein 53 and epidermal growth factor receptor and by
upregulating epithelial protection-related proteins such as epithelial cell
adhesion molecule and tenascin C, thus maintaining mucosal immune homeostasis and
epithelial integrity, mirroring the proteome analysis results. HY appears to have
a suppressive effect on colitis.

BACKGROUND: Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an effective treatment for 
recurrent Clostridium difficile infection and shows promise for treating other
medical conditions associated with intestinal dysbioses. However, we lack a
sufficient understanding of which microbial populations successfully colonize the
recipient gut, and the widely used approaches to study the microbial ecology of
FMT experiments fail to provide enough resolution to identify populations that
are likely responsible for FMT-derived benefits.
METHODS: We used shotgun metagenomics together with assembly and binning
strategies to reconstruct metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from fecal samples 
of a single FMT donor. We then used metagenomic mapping to track the occurrence
and distribution patterns of donor MAGs in two FMT recipients.
RESULTS: Our analyses revealed that 22% of the 92 highly complete bacterial MAGs 
that we identified from the donor successfully colonized and remained abundant in
two recipients for at least 8 weeks. Most MAGs with a high colonization rate
belonged to the order Bacteroidales. The vast majority of those that lacked
evidence of colonization belonged to the order Clostridiales, and colonization
success was negatively correlated with the number of genes related to
sporulation. Our analysis of 151 publicly available gut metagenomes showed that
the donor MAGs that colonized both recipients were prevalent, and the ones that
colonized neither were rare across the participants of the Human Microbiome
Project. Although our dataset showed a link between taxonomy and the colonization
ability of a given MAG, we also identified MAGs that belong to the same taxon
with different colonization properties, highlighting the importance of an
appropriate level of resolution to explore the functional basis of colonization
and to identify targets for cultivation, hypothesis generation, and testing in
model systems.
CONCLUSIONS: The analytical strategy adopted in our study can provide genomic
insights into bacterial populations that may be critical to the efficacy of FMT
due to their success in gut colonization and metabolic properties, and guide
cultivation efforts to investigate mechanistic underpinnings of this procedure
beyond associations.

Background and Aims: Inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] is characterised by a
disruption of immune homeostasis, which is tightly regulated to protect against
harmful pathogens yet not react to commensal antigens. Animal studies indicate
that regulatory T cells [Treg] modulate the immune response to prevent IBD
development. Lactoferrin [LF] is an endogenous anti-inflammatory pleiotropic
protein secreted at high concentrations in colostrum and at mucosal sites.
However, the effect of LF on specific T lymphocyte populations has not been
studied. Here, we identify a novel mechanism by which a recombinant human LF,
VEN-120, regulates T cell populations in health and disease.
Methods: Two murine models of intestinal inflammation, the dextran sodium
sulphate colitis model and the TNFΔARE/+ model of ileitis, were used to study the
anti-inflammatory and T cell modulating ability of VEN-120. Flow cytometry was
used to evaluate T cell populations within the lamina propria and mesenteric
lymph nodes, and to evaluate the effect of VEN-120 on CD4+ T cells in vitro.
Results: VEN-120 reduced inflammation in both models of IBD, accompanied by
increased Tregs in the intestinal lamina propria. Treatment of CD4+ T cells in
vitro resulted in an upregulation of Treg genes and skewing towards a Treg
population. This in vitro T cell skewing translated to an increase of Treg homing
to the intestinal lamina propria and associated lymph tissue in healthy mice.
Conclusions: These data provide a novel immunological mechanism by which VEN-120 
modulates T cells to restrict inflammatory T cell-driven disease.

Apoptosis is an important component of normal tissue physiology, and the prompt
removal of apoptotic cells is equally essential to avoid the undesirable
consequences of their accumulation and disintegration. Professional phagocytes
are highly specialized for engulfing apoptotic cells. The recent ability to track
cells that have undergone apoptosis in situ has revealed a division of labor
among the tissue resident phagocytes that sample them. Macrophages are uniquely
programmed to process internalized apoptotic cell-derived fatty acids,
cholesterol and nucleotides, as a reflection of their dominant role in clearing
the bulk of apoptotic cells. Dendritic cells carry apoptotic cells to lymph nodes
where they signal the emergence and expansion of highly suppressive regulatory
CD4 T cells. A broad suppression of inflammation is executed through distinct
phagocyte-specific mechanisms. A clever induction of negative regulatory nodes is
notable in dendritic cells serving to simultaneously shut down multiple pathways 
of inflammation. Several of the genes and pathways modulated in phagocytes in
response to apoptotic cells have been linked to chronic inflammatory and
autoimmune diseases such as atherosclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease and
systemic lupus erythematosus. Our collective understanding of old and new
phagocyte functions after apoptotic cell phagocytosis demonstrates the enormity
of ways to mediate immune suppression and enforce tissue homeostasis.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: To investigate the associations between the rs1250569 (zinc
finger MIZ-type containing 1, ZMIZ1), rs1042522 (tumour protein p53, TP53), and
rs10114470 (tumour necrosis factor-like cytokine 1A, TL1A) polymorphisms and the 
development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in a Chinese (Han) population. We
analysed the expression of genes that predispose patients to Crohn's disease (CD)
and ulcerative colitis (UC).
METHODS: A total of 381 IBD patients and 517 healthy controls were recruited into
our study. Polymorphisms at the three loci were genotyped using polymerase chain 
reaction-ligation detection reactions (PCR-LDR). Genotype-phenotype correlations 
were analysed. Blood and gut samples were obtained and analysed using
quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), western blot analysis, and
immunohistochemistry to investigate the mRNA and protein levels and in situ
expression of genes found to predispose patients to IBD. Furthermore, the
expression of susceptible genes was further verified using a mouse dextran
sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced acute colitis model.
RESULTS: No significant association was detected between rs1250569 and rs1042522 
genotypes and CD or UC susceptibility. However, the frequency of allele A of
rs1250569 was much higher in CD patients than that in healthy controls (55.03%
vs. 48.48%, respectively; p = 0.044). The mutation rates at rs10114470 were
dramatically lower at both the genotype and allele level in patients than those
in healthy controls (p = 0.002 at both the genotype and allele level).
Additionally, increased ZMIZ1 and TL1A levels were detected in intestinal samples
obtained from both IBD patients and DSS-treated mice.
CONCLUSION: rs1250569 (ZMIZ1) and rs10114470 (TL1A) are two novel loci that
indicate susceptibility to IBD in Han-Chinese patients. Consistent with previous 
studies, TL1A expression levels were higher in Chinese Han IBD patients and
DSS-treated mice. Most importantly, we found that ZMIZ1 expression was markedly
higher in both IBD patients and mice with experimentally induced colitis,
suggesting that ZMIZ1 plays important roles in the pathogenesis of IBD.

Background and Aims: The αEβ7 integrin is crucial for retention of T lymphocytes 
at mucosal surfaces through its interaction with E-cadherin. Pathogenic or
protective functions of these cells during human intestinal inflammation, such as
ulcerative colitis [UC], have not previously been defined, with understanding
largely derived from animal model data. Defining this phenotype in human samples 
is important for understanding UC pathogenesis and is of translational importance
for therapeutic targeting of αEβ7-E-cadherin interactions.
Methods: αEβ7+ and αEβ7- colonic T cell localization, inflammatory cytokine
production and expression of regulatory T cell-associated markers were evaluated 
in cohorts of control subjects and patients with active UC by
immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry and real-time PCR of FACS-purified cell
populations.
Results: CD4+αEβ7+ T lymphocytes from both healthy controls and UC patients had
lower expression of regulatory T cell-associated genes, including FOXP3, IL-10,
CTLA-4 and ICOS in comparison with CD4+αEβ7- T lymphocytes. In UC, CD4+αEβ7+
lymphocytes expressed higher levels of IFNγ and TNFα in comparison with CD4+αEβ7-
lymphocytes. Additionally the CD4+αEβ7+ subset was enriched for Th17 cells and
the recently described Th17/Th1 subset co-expressing both IL-17A and IFNγ, both
of which were found at higher frequencies in UC compared to control.
Conclusion: αEβ7 integrin expression on human colonic CD4+ T cells was associated
with increased production of pro-inflammatory Th1, Th17 and Th17/Th1 cytokines,
with reduced expression of regulatory T cell-associated markers. These data
suggest colonic CD4+αEβ7+ T cells are pro-inflammatory and may play a role in UC 
pathobiology.

Background and Aims: Patients with ulcerative colitis [UC] are at an increased
risk of developing colitis-associated cancer [CAC], suggesting that continuous
inflammation in the colon promotes the transformation of colonic epithelial
cells. However, the mechanisms underlying cell transformation in UC remain
unknown. We therefore aimed to investigate the effect of long-term inflammation
on intestinal epithelial cells [IECs] using organoid culture.
Methods: IECs were isolated from mouse colon, and were cultured according to a
method for a three-dimensional [3D] organoid culture. To mimic chronic
inflammation, a mixture of cytokines and bacterial components were added to the
medium for over a year. Cell signal intensity was assessed by 3D
immunofluorescence. Cell transformation was assessed by microarray with gene set 
enrichment analysis.
Results: Stimulation with cytokines resulted in a significant induction of target
genes for the nuclear factor [NF]-κB pathway in colonic organoids. Following 60
weeks of continuous stimulation, cell differentiation was suppressed. Continuous 
stimulation also resulted in significant amplification of NF-κB signalling.
Amplified NF-κB signalling by long-term stimulation remained in colonic organoids
even 11 weeks after the removal of all cytokines. Some genes were specifically
upregulated only in colonic organoids after the removal all cytokines following
long-term stimulation.
Conclusions: Colonic organoids stimulated with cytokines for a prolonged period
were established as in vitro model to assess long-term epithelial responses to
inflammatory cytokines. Chronic inflammation led to sustained NF-κB signalling
activation in colonic organoids, resulting in cell transformation that might be
related to the carcinogenesis of CAC in UC.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate associations between
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) presentation and variants in NOD2, TLR4, TNF-α, 
IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-RN genes in order to identify possible environmental factors 
that may affect IBD occurrence, investigate potential predictors for surgical
treatment of IBD, and correlate the presence of granulomas in biopsy specimens
with clinical characteristics of Crohn's disease (CD) patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We genotyped 167 IBD patients using PCR-based methodology
and tested for disease genotype-phenotype associations.
RESULTS: In CD patients ileal localization of disease was more frequent in NOD2
variant carriers. Ileal CD was associated with IL-6 GC+CC genotypes, identifying 
C allele as a possible marker of increased risk for ileal CD. In CD patients a
positive family history for IBD was related to earlier onset of disease, higher
risk for CD-related surgery, and appendectomy. CD patients who are TLR4 299Gly
carriers are at higher risk for surgery at onset of the disease compared with
TLR4 299Asp variant carriers. The presence of granuloma in biopsy specimens was
more frequent in patients in whom a diagnosis of CD was made during emergency
surgery. Multivariate analysis showed that CD carriers of the 299Gly allele had a
4.6-fold higher risk for emergency surgery before CD diagnosis is established
compared with noncarriers, suggesting an aggressive disease course. Granuloma in 
endoscopic biopsies is detected 5.4-fold more frequently in patients treated
surgically at the time of diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: Genetic variants together with epidemiological and clinical data of
IBD patients could potentially be used as predictors of the disease course.

The gut microbiota is essentially a multifunctional bioreactor within a human
being. The exploration of its enormous metabolic potential provides insights into
the mechanisms underlying microbial ecology and interactions with the host. The
data obtained using "shotgun" metagenomics capture information about the whole
spectrum of microbial functions. However, each new study presenting new
sequencing data tends to extract only a little of the information concerning the 
metabolic potential and often omits specific functions. A meta-analysis of the
available data with an emphasis on biomedically relevant gene groups can unveil
new global trends in the gut microbiota. As a step toward the reuse of
metagenomic data, we developed a method for the quantitative profiling of
user-defined groups of genes in human gut metagenomes. This method is based on
the quick analysis of a gene coverage matrix obtained by pre-mapping the
metagenomic reads to a global gut microbial catalogue. The method was applied to 
profile the abundance of several gene groups related to antibiotic resistance,
phages, biosynthesis clusters and carbohydrate degradation in 784 metagenomes
from healthy populations worldwide and patients with inflammatory bowel diseases 
and obesity. We discovered country-wise functional specifics in gut resistome and
virome compositions. The most distinct features of the disease microbiota were
found for Crohn's disease, followed by ulcerative colitis and obesity. Profiling 
of the genes belonging to crAssphage showed that its abundance varied across the 
world populations and was not associated with clinical status. We demonstrated
temporal resilience of crAssphage and the influence of the sample preparation
protocol on its detected abundance. Our approach offers a convenient method to
add value to accumulated "shotgun" metagenomic data by helping researchers state 
and assess novel biological hypotheses.

The mammalian gastrointestinal tract harbors trillions of commensal
microorganisms, collectively known as the microbiota. The microbiota is a
critical source of environmental stimuli and, thus, has a tremendous impact on
the health of the host. The microbes within the microbiota regulate homeostasis
within the gut, and any alteration in their composition can lead to disorders
that include inflammatory bowel disease, allergy, autoimmune disease, diabetes,
mental disorders, and cancer. Hence, restoration of the gut flora following
changes or imbalance is imperative for the host. The low-molecular-weight
compounds and nutrients such as short-chain fatty acids, polyamines, polyphenols,
and vitamins produced by microbial metabolism of nondigestible food components in
the gut actively participate in various epigenomic mechanisms that reprogram the 
genome by altering the transcriptional machinery of a cell in response to
environmental stimuli. These epigenetic modifications are caused by a set of
highly dynamic enzymes, notably histone acetylases, deacetylases, DNA methylases,
and demethylases, that are influenced by microbial metabolites and other
environmental cues. Recent studies have shown that host expression of histone
acetylases and histone deacetylases is important for regulating communication
between the intestinal microbiota and the host cells. Histone acetylases and
deacetylases influence the molecular expression of genes that affect not only
physiological functions but also behavioral shifts that occur via neuroepigenetic
modifications of genes. The underlying molecular mechanisms, however, have yet to
be fully elucidated and thus provide a new area of research. The present review
provides insights into the current understanding of the microbiota and its
association with mammalian epigenomics as well as the interaction of pathogens
and probiotics with host epigenetic machinery.

Epithelial barrier disruption is a major cause of inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD); however, the mechanism through which epigenetic regulation modulates
intestinal epithelial integrity remains largely undefined. Here we show that
EZH2, the catalytic subunit of polycomb repressive complex (PRC2), is
indispensable for maintaining epithelial cell barrier integrity and homeostasis
under inflammatory conditions. In accordance with reduced EZH2 expression in
patients, the inactivation of EZH2 in IECs sensitizes mice to DSS- and
TNBS-induced experimental colitis. Conversely, EZH2 overexpression in the
intestinal epithelium renders mice more resistant to colitis. Mechanistically,
the genes encoding TRAF2/5 are held in a finely tuned bivalent status under
inflammatory conditions. EZH2 deficiency potentiates the expression of these
genes to enhance TNFα-induced NF-κB signaling, thereby leading to uncontrolled
inflammation. More importantly, we show that EZH2 depletion compromises the
protective role of NF-κB signaling in cell survival by directly up-regulating
ITCH, a well-known E3 ligase that degrades the c-FLIP protein. Thus, our findings
highlight an epigenetic mechanism by which EZH2 integrates the multifaceted
effects of TNFα signaling to promote the inflammatory response and apoptosis in
colitis.

Objective To explore stable and functional microRNA (miRNA)-disease relationships
using a genome-wide expression profile pattern matching strategy. Methods We
applied the ranked microarray pattern matching strategy Gene Set Enrichment
Analysis to identify miRNA permutations with similar expression patterns to
diseases. We also used quantitative reverse transcription PCR to validate the
predicted expression levels of miRNAs in three diseases: inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD), oesophageal cancer, and colorectal cancer. Results We found that
hsa-miR-200 c was upregulated more than 40-fold in oesophageal cancer. The
expression of miR-16 and miR-124 was not consistently upregulated in IBD or
colorectal cancer. Conclusions Our results suggest that this expression profile
matching strategy can be used to identify functional miRNA-disease relationships.

BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for inflammatory bowel disease 
(IBD). The IL-23-driven tissue-resident group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s)
play essential roles in intestinal immunity, and targeting IL-23/12 is a
promising approach in IBD therapy.
OBJECTIVE: We set out to define the role of 1α,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 (1,25D) in
regulating functional responses of human mucosal ILC3s to IL-23 plus IL-1β
stimulation.
METHODS: Transcriptomes of sorted tonsillar ILC3s were assessed by using
microarray analysis. ILC3 cytokine production, proliferation, and differentiation
were determined by means of flow cytometry, ELISA, and multiplex immunoassay.
Intestinal cell suspensions and ILC3s sorted from gut biopsy specimens of
patients with IBD were also analyzed along with plasma 25-hydroxy vitamin D3
(25D) detection.
RESULTS: ILC3s stimulated with IL-23 plus IL-1β upregulated the vitamin D
receptor and responded to 1,25D with downregulation of the IL-23 receptor
pathway. Consequently, 1,25D suppressed IL-22, IL-17F, and GM-CSF production from
tonsillar and gut ILC3s. In parallel, 1,25D upregulated genes linked to the IL-1β
signaling pathway, as well as the IL-1β-inducible cytokines IL-6, IL-8, and
macrophage inflammatory protein 1α/β. The 1,25D-triggered skewing in ILC3
function was not accompanied or caused by changes in viability, proliferation, or
phenotype. Finally, we confirmed low 25D plasma levels in patients with IBD with 
active inflammation.
CONCLUSION: In light of the beneficial targeting of IL-23/12 in patients with
IBD, 1,25D appears as an interesting therapeutic agent that inhibits the IL-23
receptor pathway, providing a novel mechanism for how ILC3s could be manipulated 
to regulate intestinal inflammation.

Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (pIBD) is a chronic heterogeneous disorder. 
This study looks at the burden of common and rare coding mutations within 41
genes comprising the NOD signaling pathway in pIBD patients. 136 pIBD and 106
control samples underwent whole-exome sequencing. We compared the burden of
common, rare and private mutation between these two groups using the SKAT-O test.
An independent replication cohort of 33 cases and 111 controls was used to
validate significant findings. We observed variation in 40 of 41 genes comprising
the NOD signaling pathway. Four genes were significantly associated with disease 
in the discovery cohort (BIRC2 p = 0.004, NFKB1 p =  0.005, NOD2 p = 0.029 and
SUGT1 p = 0.047). Statistical significance was replicated for BIRC2 (p = 0.041)
and NOD2 (p = 0.045) in an independent validation cohort. A gene based test on
the combined discovery and replication cohort confirmed association for BIRC2
(p = 0.030). We successfully applied burden of mutation testing that jointly
assesses common and rare variants, identifying two previously implicated genes
(NFKB1 and NOD2) and confirmed a possible role in disease risk in a previously
unreported gene (BIRC2). The identification of this novel gene provides a wider
role for the inhibitor of apoptosis gene family in IBD pathogenesis.

Immune-based inflammatory diseases involve immune related dysregulation in
different sites of body, which includes rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis,
inflammatory bowel disease, atherosclerosis, etc. Advancements in molecular
research have facilitated investigation of their pathogenesis that is involved in
inflammatory cytokines cells and several genes. The available drug therapy
provides suboptimal therapeutic effects and higher adverse effects. Emergence of 
liposomal systems of the drugs meant for the above mentioned disease has gained
broader importance due to their high treatment efficacy by means of optimal
therapeutic drug delivery. Beyond the conventional liposomal formulations,
evolution of second generation liposomes including stealth liposomes, cationic
liposomes, immuno-liposomes, etc. has gained tremendous attention owing to their 
drug target potential, diagnostic importance and imaging in treatment of above
mentioned immune mediated inflammatory disorders.

OBJECTIVES: Hispanics represent an understudied inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) 
population. Prior studies examining genetic predisposition to IBD in Hispanics
are limited. In this study, we examined whether European-derived IBD variants
confer risk in Hispanics and their influence on IBD phenotype in Hispanics
compared to non-Hispanic whites (NHW).
METHODS: Self-identified Hispanics and NHWs with IBD were included. Hispanic
controls were included for our genetic analyses. We performed single-variant
testing at previously identified Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)
IBD variants in Hispanic cases and controls. These risk variants were used to
compute individual genetic risk scores. Genetic risk scores and phenotype
associations were compared between Hispanic and NHW.
RESULTS: A total of 1,115 participants were included: 698 controls and 417 IBD
patients (230 Hispanics). We found evidence of association within our Hispanic
cohort at 22 IBD risk loci, with ~76% of the risk loci demonstrating
over-representation of the European risk allele; these included loci
corresponding to IL23R and NOD2 genes. CD genetic risk score for Hispanics
(199.67) was similar to the score for NHW (200.33), P=0.51; the same was true in 
UC. Genetic risk scores did not predict IBD phenotype or complications in
Hispanics or NHW except for a younger age of CD onset in Hispanics (P=0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the fundamental importance of these loci in
IBD pathogenesis including in our diverse Hispanic population. Future studies
looking at non-genetic mechanisms of disease are needed to explain differences in
age of presentation and phenotype between Hispanics and NHW.

The study of the genetic underpinnings of inflammatory bowel disease has made
great progress since the identification of NOD2 as a major susceptibility gene.
Novel genotyping and sequencing technologies have led to the discovery of 242
common susceptibility loci, 45 of which have been fine-mapped to statistically
conclusive causal variants; 50 genes associated with very-early-onset
inflammatory disease have been identified. The evolving genetic architecture of
inflammatory bowel disease has deepened our understanding of its pathogenesis
through identification of major disease associated pathways-knowledge that has
the potential to indicate novel drug targets or markers for personalised
medicine. However, many causal variants have yet to be identified, and a large
proportion of missing heritability still needs to be accounted for. In addition, 
the medical and scientific communities are probably not yet fully harnessing the 
power of these genetic discoveries.

The multidrug resistance-1 (MDR1) gene encodes an ATP-dependent efflux
transporter that is highly expressed in the colon. In mice, loss of MDR1 function
results in colitis with similarities to human inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). 
Here, we show that MDR1 has an unexpected protective role for the mitochondria
where MDR1 deficiency results in mitochondrial dysfunction with increased
mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) driving the development of colitis. 
Exogenous induction of mROS accelerates, while inhibition attenuates colitis in
vivo; these effects are amplified in MDR1 deficiency. In human IBD, MDR1 is
negatively correlated to SOD2 gene expression required for mROS detoxification.
To provide direct evidential support, we deleted intestinal SOD2 gene in mice and
showed an increased susceptibility to colitis. We exploited the genome-wide
association data sets and found many (∼5%) of IBD susceptibility genes with
direct roles in regulating mitochondria homeostasis. As MDR1 primarily protects
against xenotoxins via its efflux function, our findings implicate a distinct
mitochondrial toxin+genetic susceptibility interaction leading to mitochondrial
dysfunction, a novel pathogenic mechanism that could offer many new therapeutic
opportunities for IBD.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Variants in the tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 15
gene (TNFSF15, also called TL1A) have been associated with risk for inflammatory 
bowel disease (IBD). TL1A affects expression of multiple cytokines to promote
mucosal inflammation. Little is known about the TL1A-response pathways that
regulate cytokine expression. We investigated T-cell gene expression patterns to 
determine the mechanisms by which TL1A regulates cytokine production, and whether
these associate with outcomes of patients with Crohn's disease (CD).
METHODS: Peripheral T cells isolated from normal donors were cultured with TL1A. 
We performed gene expression profile analysis by RNA sequencing of subsets of
interferon gamma (IFNG)-producing and non-producing cells purified by flow
cytometry. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis was used to identify
gene expression differences between these subsets. Ribonuclease T2 gene (RNASET2)
expression and methylation were assessed by quantitative trait loci analyses.
Clinical characteristics of patients (complications, resistance to therapy, and
recurrence time) were associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms in RNASET2.
We performed motif screening to identify polymorphisms that disrupt transcription
factor binding sites. Levels of RNASET2 were knocked down with small interfering 
RNA in CD4+ T cells and the effect on protein expression was determined by
proteomic analysis and cytokine production. Cell aggregation was measured by flow
cytometry.
RESULTS: We identified 764 genes with at least a 2-fold difference in
TL1A-mediated expression between IFNG-secreting and non-secreting T cells (P <
1 × 10-5). Many of these genes were located near IBD susceptibility variants.
RNASET2 was the only IBD risk-associated gene with >5-fold down-regulation in the
IFNG-secreting subset. RNASET2 disease risk variants were associated with
decreased expression in peripheral and mucosal tissues and DNA hypermethylation
in CD patients requiring surgical intervention. RNASET2 disease risk variants
were associated in CD patients with more complicated disease or resistance to
therapy, defined in part by failed response to treatment, increased length of
intestinal resection, shorter time to repeat surgery, and high Rutgeerts score
(>2) in postoperative endoscopy. The RNASET2 variant rs2149092 was predicted to
disrupt a consensus binding site for the transcription factor ETS within an
enhancer region. Expression of RNASET2 correlated with expression of ETS. RNASET2
knockdown in T cells increased expression of IFNG and intercellular adhesion
molecule 1 (ICAM1) and induced T-cell aggregation. A blocking antibody against
(ILFA1), disrupting the lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1-intercellular
adhesion molecule 1 interaction, reduced T-cell production of IFNG.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified decreased expression of RNASET2 as a component of
TL1A-mediated increase in production of IFNG and as a potential biomarker for
patients with severe CD. Further study of the role of RNASET2 in regulating
mucosal inflammation may lead to development of novel therapeutic targets.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) develop as a result of a
combination of genetic predisposition, dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, and
environmental influences. Here, we describe an example of how caspase recruitment
domain 9 (CARD9), one of the numerous IBD susceptibility genes, participate to
colitis susceptibility by shaping gut microbiota to produce tryptophan
metabolites.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent study showed that CARD9 mice are more susceptible to
colitis as a result of impaired interleukin 22 signaling pathway. Furthermore,
aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligands from tryptophan metabolism by the gut
microbiota participate to intestinal homeostasis by inducing production of
interleukin 22 by intestinal immune cells. These data suggest an interaction
between CARD9 and the ability of gut microbiota to produce AhR ligands.
SUMMARY: The microbiota from CARD9 mice fails to metabolize tryptophan leading to
defective AhR activation which contributes to the susceptibility of mice to
colitis by decreased interleukin 22 production. These effects were abrogated in
the presence of AhR agonist. Reduced production of AhR ligands is also observed
in the microbiota from individuals with IBD, particularly in those with CARD9
risk alleles associated with IBD. Correcting impaired microbiota functions, such 
as ability to produce AhR ligands, is an attractive strategy in IBD.

OBJECTIVE: Blood vessel epicardial substance (BVES) is a tight
junction-associated protein that regulates epithelial-mesenchymal states and is
underexpressed in epithelial malignancy. However, the functional impact of BVES
loss on tumourigenesis is unknown. Here we define the in vivo role of BVES in
colitis-associated cancer (CAC), its cellular function and its relevance to
patients with IBD.
DESIGN: We determined BVES promoter methylation status using an Infinium
HumanMethylation450 array screen of patients with UC with and without CAC. We
also measured BVES mRNA levels in a tissue microarray consisting of normal colons
and CAC samples. Bves-/- and wild-type mice (controls) were administered
azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) to induce tumour formation.
Last, we used a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify BVES interactors and
performed mechanistic studies in multiple cell lines to define how BVES reduces
c-Myc levels.
RESULTS: BVES mRNA was reduced in tumours from patients with CAC via promoter
hypermethylation. Importantly, BVES promoter hypermethylation was concurrently
present in distant non-malignant-appearing mucosa. As seen in human patients,
Bves was underexpressed in experimental inflammatory carcinogenesis, and Bves-/- 
mice had increased tumour multiplicity and degree of dysplasia after AOM/DSS
administration. Molecular analysis of Bves-/- tumours revealed Wnt activation and
increased c-Myc levels. Mechanistically, we identified a new signalling pathway
whereby BVES interacts with PR61α, a protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunit,
to mediate c-Myc destruction.
CONCLUSION: Loss of BVES promotes inflammatory tumourigenesis through
dysregulation of Wnt signalling and the oncogene c-Myc. BVES promoter methylation
status may serve as a CAC biomarker.

BACKGROUND: The recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD) suggest significant genetic overlap with complex
mycobacterial diseases like tuberculosis or leprosy. TLR variants have previously
been linked to susceptibility for mycobacterial diseases. Here we investigated
the contribution to IBD risk of two TLR2 polymorphisms, the low-prevalence
variant Arg753Gln and the GTn microsatellite repeat polymorphism in intron 2. We 
studied association with disease, possible correlations with phenotype and
gene-gene interactions.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a large study in 843 patients with
Crohn's disease, 426 patients with ulcerative colitis and 805 healthy, unrelated 
controls, all of European origin. Overall, the frequency for carriers of shorter 
GTn repeats in intron 2 of the TLR2 gene, which have previously been associated
with low TLR2 expression and high IL-10 production, was slightly elevated in
Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis compared to healthy controls (16.0% resp. 
16.7% vs. 12.8%). The highest frequency of short GTn carriers was noted among IBD
patients on anti TNF-alpha therapy. However, none of these differences was
significant in the multivariate analysis. The Arg753Gln polymorphism showed no
association with any clinical subtype of IBD, including extensive colitis, for
which such an association was previously described. We found no association with 
specific phenotypic disease subgroups. Also, epistasis analysis revealed no
significant interactions between the two TLR2 variants and confirmed IBD
susceptibility genes.
CONCLUSIONS: The two functional relevant polymorphisms in TLR2, the GTn
microsatellite repeat polymorphism in intron 2 and the Arg753Gln variant do not
seem to play a role in the susceptibility to Crohn's disease or ulcerative
colitis.

Microbiota influence diverse aspects of intestinal physiology and disease in part
by controlling tissue-specific transcription of host genes. However, host genomic
mechanisms mediating microbial control of intestinal gene expression are poorly
understood. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) is the most ancient family of
nuclear receptor transcription factors with important roles in human metabolic
and inflammatory bowel diseases, but a role in host response to microbes is
unknown. Using an unbiased screening strategy, we found that zebrafish Hnf4a
specifically binds and activates a microbiota-suppressed intestinal epithelial
transcriptional enhancer. Genetic analysis revealed that zebrafish hnf4a
activates nearly half of the genes that are suppressed by microbiota, suggesting 
microbiota negatively regulate Hnf4a. In support, analysis of genomic
architecture in mouse intestinal epithelial cells disclosed that microbiota
colonization leads to activation or inactivation of hundreds of enhancers along
with drastic genome-wide reduction of HNF4A and HNF4G occupancy. Interspecies
meta-analysis suggested interactions between HNF4A and microbiota promote gene
expression patterns associated with human inflammatory bowel diseases. These
results indicate a critical and conserved role for HNF4A in maintaining
intestinal homeostasis in response to microbiota.

BACKGROUND: Generalized verrucosis (GV) is a chronic and progressive cutaneous
human papillomavirus (HPV) infection resulting in multiple warts and associated
with acquired or genetic immune defects. We identified a consanguineous Arab
family manifesting GV and recurrent bacterial and viral infections, in
association with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
OBJECTIVE: To identify the mutated gene responsible for GV, recurrent infections 
and IBD, in this family.
METHODS: Flow cytometry of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was performed, as
well as proliferation and cell cycle assays of T cells. Whole exome sequencing
was utilized to detect candidate mutated genes, assuming an autosomal recessive
mode of inheritance. Skin fibroblasts from a patient, the mother and control were
incubated with sorbitol to detect the phosphorylation ability of TAOK2, and a
clonogenic assay was performed to assess the survival and proliferative capacity 
of fibroblasts' colonies.
RESULTS: Despite normal immunophenotyping of T and B cells, T cell proliferation 
upon activation was impaired in a patient compared to a heterozygous family
member and a control. Genetic analyses identified a rare homozygous missense
variant, c.2098C>T (p.R700C) in the TAOK2 gene, segregating with the disease
phenotype in the family. TAOK2 encodes the TAO2 kinase, a mitogen activated
protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) in the p38-MAPK cascade. The mutation is
predicted to disrupt its normal folding and molecular interaction; however, no
impairment was observed in TAOK2 kinase activity toward its downstream target,
MEK3/6, in patient's fibroblasts. Despite this normal kinase activity, a
noticeably higher survival/proliferation of patient's skin fibroblasts was found.
CONCLUSIONS: A mutation in TAOK2 appears to cause a novel form of primary
immunodeficiency, characterized by an impaired T cell proliferation upon
activation. This novel cause of GV gives further support to the importance of the
p38-MAPK pathway in the immune response against HPV, and possibly also in the
pathogenesis of IBD.

Background and Aims: Primary sclerosing cholangitis [PSC] is an idiopathic
chronic disorder of the hepatobiliary system associated with inflammatory bowel
disease [IBD], mainly ulcerative colitis [UC]. Colitis in patients with PSC and
UC [PSC-UC] exhibits characteristic features and is linked to increased colon
cancer risk. Genetic studies have identified immune-related susceptibility genes 
that only partially overlap with those involved in IBD. These observations
suggest that PSC-UC may represent a distinct form of IBD. It remains to be
elucidated whether different immune mechanisms are involved in colitis in these
patients. We aimed to evaluate systemic and intestinal T cell and innate lymphoid
cell [ILC] responses, previously associated with IBD, in patients with PSC-UC
compared with patients with UC and healthy controls.
Methods: Blood samples and colorectal biopsies were collected from patients with 
PSC-UC, patients with UC, and healthy controls. T cell and ILC phenotypes were
analysed by multicolour flow cytometry.
Results: Chemokine receptor [CCR] profiling of circulating T cells showed
decreased CCR6-CXCR3+ Th1 cells in PSC-UC, but increased CCR6-CCR4+ Th2 cells
only in UC, whereas increased CCR6+CCR4+ Th17 cells were found in both patient
groups compared with healthy controls. Increased frequencies of IFN-γ secreting T
cells were found in the colon of patients with PSC-UC compared with UC.
Interestingly, we observed accumulation of ILC in the colon in PSC-UC.
Conclusions: Our study suggests that PSC-UC represents a different immunological 
disorder from UC, characterised by increased intestinal Th1 and ILC responses.
These results provide further evidence that PSC-UC may represent a distinct form 
of IBD.

Ulcerative colitis (UC), a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), is a chronic
inflammatory disorder of the colon. Although UC is generally treated with
anti-inflammatory drugs or immunosuppressants, most of these treatments often
prove to be inadequate. Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a phenolic ester included in
various medicinal herbs such as Salvia miltiorrhiz and Perilla frutescens.
Although RA has many biological and pharmacological activities, the
anti-inflammatory effect of RA in colonic tissue remains unclear. In this study, 
we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying molecular mechanism 
of RA in mice with dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. In the
DSS-induced colitis model, RA significantly reduced the severity of colitis, as
assessed by disease activity index (DAI) scores, colonic damage, and colon
length. In addition, RA resulted in the reduction of the inflammatory-related
cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-22, and protein levels of COX-2 and iNOS
in mice with DSS-induced colitis. Furthermore, RA effectively and pleiotropically
inhibited nuclear factor-kappa B and signal transducer and activator of
transcription 3 activation, and subsequently reduced the activity of pro-survival
genes that depend on these transcription factors. These results demonstrate that 
RA has an ameliorative effect on colonic inflammation and thus a potential
therapeutic role in colitis.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) results from a complex series of interactions
between susceptibility genes, the environment, and the immune system. Recently,
some studies provided strong evidence that the process of autophagy affects
several aspects of mucosal immune responses. Autophagy is a cellular stress
response that plays key roles in physiological processes, such as innate and
adaptive immunity, adaptation to starvation, degradation of aberrant proteins or 
organelles, antimicrobial defense, and protein secretion. Dysfunctional autophagy
is recognized as a contributing factor in many chronic inflammatory diseases,
including IBD. Autophagy plays multiple roles in IBD pathogenesis by altering
processes that include intracellular bacterial killing, antimicrobial peptide
secretion by Paneth cells, goblet cell function, proinflammatory cytokine
production by macrophages, antigen presentation by dendritic cells, and the
endoplasmic reticulum stress response in enterocytes. Recent studies have
identified susceptibility genes involved in autophagy, such as NOD2, ATG16L1, and
IRGM, and active research is ongoing all over the world. The aim of this review
is a systematic appraisal of the current literature to provide a better
understanding of the role of autophagy in the pathogenesis of IBD. Understanding 
these mechanisms will bring about new strategies for the treatment and prevention
of IBD.

Crohn's disease (CD) is a multifactorial immunologically mediated disease. In
this study we explored, for the first time, the efficacy of the Multiplex Gene
Assay technology for detecting mRNA expression profile of 24 selected CD related 
genes in endoscopic biopsies and surgical specimens from CD patients with colonic
localization of the disease. The polymorphisms of genes most frequently
associated with CD were also analysed in DNA samples from the same patients. The 
analysis of endoscopic samples showed increased expression of 7 genes in inflamed
mucosa compared to non-inflamed mucosa and suggests the activation of the
autophagy process and of a Th17 adaptive response. The analysis of surgical
specimens showed increased expression of 16 genes in inflamed tissue compared to 
non-inflamed internal controls and revealed the activation of immune-adaptive
Th17 response in association with a Th1 response. Furthermore, an increased
expression of genes involved in ionic transport and signal transduction was found
in inflamed mucosa compared to non-inflamed internal controls. This study
confirms the activation of Th17 and Th1 adaptive-immune response also in colonic 
CD. It should be stressed that these responses have been disclosed in biopsy
tissue, while only Th17 differentiation is revealed in endoscopic tissue.
Interestingly, the polymorphisms analysis revealed that a homozygous genotype is 
associated to a more complicated clinical course.

BACKGROUND. Morphological patterns of Paneth cells are a prognostic biomarker in 
Western Crohn's disease (CD) patients, and are associated with
autophagy-associated ATG16L1 and NOD2 variants. We hypothesized that genetic
determinants of Paneth cell phenotype in other ethnic CD cohorts are distinct but
also involved in autophagy. METHODS. We performed a hypothesis-driven analysis of
56 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with CD susceptibility or
known to affect Paneth cell function in 110 Japanese CD patients who underwent
ileal resection. We subsequently performed a genome-wide association analysis.
Paneth cell phenotype was determined by defensin-5 immunofluorescence. Selected
genotype-Paneth cell defect correlations were compared to a Western CD cohort (n 
= 164). RESULTS. The average percentage of abnormal Paneth cells in Japanese CD
was similar to Western CD (P = 0.87), and abnormal Paneth cell phenotype was also
associated with early recurrence (P = 0.013). In contrast to Western CD, ATG16L1 
T300A was not associated with Paneth cell defect in Japanese CD (P = 0.20). Among
the 56 selected SNPs, only LRRK2 M2397T showed significant association with
Paneth cell defect (P = 3.62 × 10-4), whereas in the Western CD cohort it was not
(P = 0.76). Pathway analysis of LRRK2 and other candidate genes with P less than 
5 × 10-4 showed connections with known CD susceptibility genes and links to
autophagy and TNF-α networks. CONCLUSIONS. We found dichotomous effects of
ATG16L1 and LRRK2 on Paneth cell defect between Japanese and Western CD. Genes
affecting Paneth cell phenotype in Japanese CD were also associated with
autophagy. Paneth cell phenotype also predicted prognosis in Japanese CD.

Lung cancer causes huge mortality worldwide, and targeting new pathway may
provide an alternative in modulating signaling in cancer. Nuclear factor
erythroid 2-related factor 2 is the major regulator of endogenous and exogenous
stress by activating numerous antioxidant genes critical in cancer, Alzheimer's, 
Parkinson's, and inflammatory bowel diseases. Ganoderic acid is a triterpene from
basiodiomycetes fungus Ganoderma lucidum with numerous therapeutic effects. In
this study, ganoderic acid and its 50 isomers and natural activators were docked 
by receptor-based molecular docking using Maestro 9.6 (Schrödinger Inc.) in the
Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1-nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2
signaling pathway. The receptor-based molecular docking reveals the best binding 
interaction of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 and ganoderic acid A
with GScore (-9.69) (kcal/mol), Lipophilic EvdW (-1.83), Electro (-0.72), Glide
emodel (-73.369), H bond (-1.1), molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface
area (-75.541) with Leu 718, Asp 800, Cys 797 residues involved in hydrogen
bonding. The calculated docking energy highlights the lipophilic, hydrogen
bonding, pi-pi stacking interactions, and non-covalent bonding. Analysis showed
the involvement of cysteine and serine residues which were crucial in the
activation and translocation from cytoplasm to the nucleus in the nuclear factor 
erythroid 2-related factor 2 signaling process. The molecular docking tool
QikProp analyzed the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and
toxicity but needs some modifications in their structure to satisfy Lipinski's
rule. Ganoderic acid A is a best docked isoform which inhibits the cell
proliferation, viability, migration, and reactive oxygen species and messenger
RNA expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 in H460 cells.

Synthetic glucocorticoids (GCs), including dexamethasone (DEX), are powerful
anti-inflammatory drugs. Long-term use of GCs, however, can result in metabolic
side effects such as hyperglycemia, hepatosteatosis, and insulin resistance. The 
GC receptor (GR) and liver X receptors (LXRα and LXRβ) regulate overlapping genes
involved in gluconeogenesis and inflammation. We have previously shown that
Lxrβ-/- mice are resistant to the diabetogenic effects of DEX but still sensitive
to its immunosuppressive actions. To determine whether this finding could be
exploited for therapeutic intervention, we treated mice with GSK2033, a pan-LXR
antagonist, alone or combined with DEX. GSK2033 suppressed GC-induced
gluconeogenic gene expression without affecting immune-responsive GR target
genes. The suppressive effect of GSK2033 on DEX-induced gluconeogenic genes was
specific to LXRβ, was liver cell autonomous, and occurred in a target
gene-specific manner. Compared with DEX treatment alone, the coadministration of 
GSK2033 with DEX decreased the recruitment of GR and its accessory factors MED1
and C/EBPβ to the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase promoter. However, GSK2033
had no effect on DEX-mediated suppression of inflammatory genes expressed in the 
liver or in mouse primary macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharides. In
conclusion, our study provides evidence that the gluconeogenic and
immunosuppressive actions of GR activation can be mechanistically dissociated by 
pharmacological antagonism of LXRβ. Treatment with an LXRβ antagonist could allow
the safer use of existing GC drugs in patients requiring chronic dosing of
anti-inflammatory agents for the treatment of diseases such as rheumatoid
arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease.

Infantile-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IO IBD) is an invalidating illness
with an onset before 2 years of age and has a complex pathophysiology in which
genetic factors are important. Homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing in
an IO IBD patient and subsequent sequencing of the candidate gene in 12
additional IO IBD patients revealed two patients with two mutated ankyrin repeat 
and zinc-finger domain-containing 1 (ANKZF1) alleles (homozygous ANKZF1 R585Q
mutation and compound heterozygous ANKZF1 E152K and V32_Q87del mutations,
respectively) and two patients with one mutated ANKZF1 allele. Although the
function of ANKZF1 in mammals had not been previously evaluated, we show that
ANKZF1 has an indispensable role in the mitochondrial response to cellular
stress. ANKZF1 is located diffusely in the cytoplasm and translocates to the
mitochondria upon cellular stress. ANKZF1 depletion reduces mitochondrial
integrity and mitochondrial respiration under conditions of cellular stress. The 
ANKZF1 mutations identified in IO IBD patients with two mutated ANKZF1 alleles
result in dysfunctional ANKZF1, as shown by an increased level of apoptosis in
patients' lymphocytes, a decrease in mitochondrial respiration in patient
fibroblasts with a homozygous ANKZF1 R585Q mutation, and an inability of ANKZF1
R585Q and E152K to rescue the phenotype of yeast deficient in Vms1, the yeast
homologue of ANKZF1. These data indicate that loss-of-function mutations in
ANKZF1 result in deregulation of mitochondrial integrity, and this may play a
pathogenic role in the development of IO IBD.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that play an important
role in regulating the gene expression of their target genes. SNP miR-196a-2
rs11614913 and miR-499 rs3746444 are reported to have association with the risk
and prognosis of multiple-types of inflammatory diseases including IBD. This
study was conducted to show if any association of SNP miR-196a-2rs11614913 and
miR-499 rs3746444 exists with ulcerative colitis (UC) patients of north Indian
population and how these polymorphisms modulate the expression profile of the
respective miRNAs.
METHODS: A total of 638 participants including 197 UC patients and 441 controls
were included in this study. Polymorphisms were genotyped by PCR-RFLP and the
miRNA expression was measured using qRT-PCR. Genotypes and allele frequencies
were calculated using SPSS 16 software.
RESULTS: MiR-196a-2 rs11614913 (C>T) and miR-499 rs3746444 (T>C) were found to be
associated with UC. TT genotype of miR-196a-2 rs11614913 (p = 0.03) was
negatively associated with UC whereas the heterozygous TC genotype of miR-499
rs3746444 (p = 0.003) was showing positive association with UC. Patients having a
combination of both SNPs, developed disease at older age and they suffered from
severe disease extent. Genotype that showed association with the disease also
showed correlation with the changes in miRNA expression.
CONCLUSION: In this study we found miR-196a-2 rs11614913 and miR-499 rs3746444
were associated with UC in north Indian population. We found the genotype that
showed association with UC also altered the expression of respective miRNA in the
patient harboring the genotype. There was correlation between associated genotype
and altered miRNA expression.

Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) is a rare, pediatric,
autoinflammatory disease characterized by bone pain due to sterile osteomyelitis,
and is often accompanied by psoriasis or inflammatory bowel disease. There are
two syndromic forms of CRMO, Majeed syndrome and DIRA, for which the genetic
cause is known. However, for the majority of cases of CRMO, the genetic basis is 
unknown. Via whole-exome sequencing, we detected a homozygous mutation in the
filamin-binding domain of FBLIM1 in an affected child with consanguineous
parents. Microarray analysis of bone marrow macrophages from the CRMO murine
model (cmo) determined that the Fblim1 ortholog is the most differentially
expressed gene, downregulated over 20-fold in the cmo mouse. We sequenced FBLIM1 
in 96 CRMO subjects and found a second proband with a novel frameshift mutation
in exon 6 and a rare regulatory variant. In SaOS2 cells, overexpressing the
regulatory mutation showed the flanking region acts as an enhancer, and the
mutation ablates enhancer activity. Our data implicate FBLIM1 in the pathogenesis
of sterile bone inflammation and our findings suggest CRMO is a disorder of
chronic inflammation and imbalanced bone remodeling.

During six years as German National Consultant Laboratory for Spirochetes we
investigated 149 intestinal biopsies from 91 patients, which were
histopathologically diagnosed with human intestinal spirochetosis (HIS), using
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) combined with 16S rRNA gene PCR and
sequencing. Aim of this study was to complement histopathological findings with
FISH and PCR for definite diagnosis and species identification of the causative
pathogens. HIS is characterized by colonization of the colonic mucosa of the
human distal intestinal tract by Brachyspira spp. Microbiological diagnosis of
HIS is not performed, because of the fastidious nature and slow growth of
Brachyspira spp. in culture. In clinical practice, diagnosis of HIS relies solely
on histopathology without differentiation of the spirochetes. We used a
previously described FISH probe to detect and identify Brachyspira spp. in
histological gut biopsies. FISH allowed rapid visualization and identification of
Brachyspira spp. in 77 patients. In most cases, the bright FISH signal already
allowed rapid localization of Brachyspira spp. at 400× magnification. By
sequencing, 53 cases could be assigned to the B. aalborgi lineage including
"B. ibaraki" and "B. hominis", and 23 cases to B. pilosicoli. One case showed
mixed colonization. The cases reported here reaffirm all major HIS Brachyspira
spp. clusters already described. However, the phylogenetic diversity seems to be 
even greater than previously reported. In 14 cases, we could not confirm HIS by
either FISH or PCR, but found colonization of the epithelium by rods and cocci,
indicating misdiagnosis by histopathology. FISH in combination with molecular
identification by 16S rRNA gene sequencing has proved to be a valuable addition
to histopathology. It provides definite diagnosis of HIS and allows insights into
phylogeny and distribution of Brachyspira spp. HIS should be considered as a
differential diagnosis in diarrhea of unknown origin, particularly in patients
from risk groups (e.g. patients with colonic adenomas, inflammatory polyps,
inflammatory bowel disease or HIV infection and in men who have sex with men).

Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affecting the 
lining of digestive tracts of the colon and ileum. To investigate the reasons
behind the presence of CD phenotype in one of the monozygotic (MZ) twins, we
utilized the whole exome sequence (WES) datasets of CD tissue biopsy and CD blood
of affected twin and the exome dataset of blood from healthy twin. We report the 
presence of discordant and rare damaging mutation in HNRNPD and other risk
polymorphisms such as, rs12103, rs2241880, rs3810936, rs7076156, rs1042058 and
rs1292053. HNRNPD was found carrying two novel heterozygous mutations - a stop
gain mutation that truncated the protein at 249th and 268th amino acid position
and a single base missense mutation replacing Aspartate with Valine at 300th
amino acid. The identified risk polymorphisms were found conferring
susceptibility to CD and IBD. Discordant deleterious and damaging mutation was
detected in HNRNPD that have been implicated in inflammatory pathways.
Integrating these variants led to the elucidation of pathophysiology of CD in the
affected twin involving the causal processes of macrophage activation, tissue
death, autophagy, immune response, cell-migration and T-cell activation.

Identification of disease genes is a hot topic in biomedicine and genomics.
However, it is a challenging problem because of the complexity of diseases.
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an idiopathic disease caused by a
dysregulated immune response to host intestinal microflora. It has been proven to
be associated with the development of intestinal malignancies. Although the
specific pathological characteristics and genetic background of IBD have been
partially revealed, it is still an overdetermined disease and the blueprint of
all genetic variants still needs to be improved. In this study, a novel
computational method was built to identify genes related to IBD. Samples from two
subtypes of IBD (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) and normal samples were 
employed. By analyzing the gene expression profiles of these samples using
minimum redundancy maximum relevance and incremental feature selection, 21 genes 
were obtained that could effectively distinguish samples from the two subtypes of
IBD and the normal samples. Then, the shortest-path approach was used to search
for an additional 20 genes in a large network constructed using protein-protein
interactions based on the above-mentioned 21 genes. Analyses of the 41 genes
obtained indicate that they are closely associated with this disease.

Pregnane X receptor (PXR) regulates the expression of many genes, including those
involved in drug metabolism and transport, and has been linked to various
diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease. In the present study, we
determined whether carnosic acid and other chemicals in rosemary extract
(carnosol, ursolic acid, and rosmarinic acid) are PXR activators. As assessed in 
dual-luciferase reporter gene assays, carnosic acid, carnosol, and ursolic acid, 
but not rosmarinic acid, activated human PXR (hPXR) and mouse PXR (mPXR), whereas
carnosol and ursolic acid, but not carnosic acid or rosmarinic acid, activated
rat PXR (rPXR). Dose-response experiments indicated that carnosic acid, carnosol,
and ursolic acid activated hPXR with EC50 values of 0.79, 2.22, and 10.77μM,
respectively. Carnosic acid, carnosol, and ursolic acid, but not rosmarinic acid,
transactivated the ligand-binding domain of hPXR and recruited steroid receptor
coactivator-1 (SRC-1), SRC-2, and SRC-3 to the ligand-binding domain of hPXR.
Carnosic acid, carnosol, and ursolic acid, but not rosmarinic acid, increased
hPXR target gene expression, as shown by an increase in CYP3A4, UGT1A3, and ABCB1
mRNA expression in LS180 human colon adenocarcinoma cells. Rosmarinic acid did
not attenuate the extent of hPXR activation by rifampicin, suggesting it is not
an antagonist of hPXR. Overall, carnosic acid, carnosol, and ursolic acid, but
not rosmarinic acid, are hPXR agonists, and carnosic acid shows species-dependent
activation of hPXR and mPXR, but not rPXR. The findings provide new mechanistic
insight on the effects of carnosic acid, carnosol, and ursolic acid on
PXR-mediated biological effects.

Many gastrointestinal diseases exhibit a protracted and aggravated inflammatory
response that can lead to hypercytokinaemia, culminating in extensive tissue
damage. Recently, angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) has been implicated in many
inflammation-associated diseases. However, how ANGPTL4 regulates colonic
inflammation remains unclear. Herein, we show that ANGPTL4 deficiency in mice
(ANGPTL4-/-) exacerbated colonic inflammation induced by dextran sulfate sodium
(DSS) or stearic acid. Microbiota was similar between the two genotypes prior DSS
challenge. A microarray gene expression profile of the colon from DSS-treated
ANGPTL4-/- mice was enriched for genes involved in leukocyte migration and
infiltration, and showed a close association to inflamed ulcerative colitis (UC),
whereas the profile from ANGPTL4+/+ littermates resembled that of non-inflamed UC
biopsies. Bone marrow transplantation demonstrates the intrinsic role of colonic 
ANGPTL4 in regulating leukocyte infiltration during DSS-induced inflammation.
Using immortalized human colon epithelial cells, we revealed that the
ANGPTL4-mediated upregulation of tristetraprolin expression operates through CREB
and NF-κB transcription factors, which in turn, regulates the stability of
chemokines. Together, our findings suggest that ANGPTL4 protects against acute
colonic inflammation and that its absence exacerbates the severity of
inflammation. Our findings emphasize the importance of ANGPTL4 as a novel target 
for therapy in regulating and attenuating inflammation.

Combination treatment with low-dose thiopurine and allopurinol (AP) has
successfully been used in patients with inflammatory bowel disease with a so
called skewed thiopurine metabolite profile. In red blood cells in vivo, it
reduces the concentration of methylated metabolites and increases the
concentration of the phosphorylated ones, which is associated with improved
therapeutic efficacy. This study aimed to investigate the largely unknown
mechanism of AP on thiopurine metabolism in cells with an active thiopurine
metabolic pathway using HepG2 and HEK293 cells. Cells were treated with
6-mercaptopurine (6MP) and AP or its metabolite oxypurinol. The expression of
genes known to be associated with thiopurine metabolism, and the concentration of
thiopurine metabolites were analyzed. Gene expression levels were only affected
by AP in the presence of 6MP. The addition of AP to 6MP affected the expression
of in total 19 genes in the two cell lines. In both cell lines the expression of 
the transporter SLC29A2 was reduced by the combined treatment. Six regulated
genes in HepG2 cells and 8 regulated genes in HEK293 cells were connected to
networks with 18 and 35 genes, respectively, present at known susceptibility loci
for inflammatory bowel disease, when analyzed using a protein-protein interaction
database. The genes identified as regulated as well as the disease associated
interacting genes represent new candidates for further investigation in the
context of combination therapy with thiopurines and AP. However, no differences
in absolute metabolite concentrations were observed between 6MP+AP or
6MP+oxypurinol vs. 6MP alone in either of the two cell lines. In conclusion; the 
effect of AP on gene expression levels requires the presence of 6MP, at least in 
vitro. Previously described AP-effects on metabolite concentrations observed in
red blood cells in vivo could not be reproduced in our cell lines in vitro. AP's 
effects in relation to thiopurine metabolism are complex. The network-identified 
susceptibility genes represented biological processes mainly associated with
purine nucleotide biosynthetic processes, lymphocyte proliferation, NF-KB
activation, JAK-STAT signaling, and apoptotic signaling at oxidative stress.

BACKGROUND: Through mounting genetic investigations, it has been established that
IL12B and IL23R gene single nucleotide polymorphisms have significant
associations with autoimmune diseases including inflammatory bowel disease,
psoriasis, and ankylosing spondylitis. IL-12/IL-23 pathway plays a pivotal role
in etiopathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS), suggested by studies both in
patients and animal models.
METHODS: In a case-control study, 145 MS patients and 200 healthy subjects were
genotyped for polymorphisms in IL12B and IL23R genes using Real-Time PCR allelic 
discrimination approach. Additionally, quantitative analysis of mRNA expression
of IL12B in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells from patients and controls was
conducted through Real-Time PCR using the TaqMan Gene Expression Assay.
RESULTS: The rs6887695 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in IL12B gene showed 
an association with susceptibility to MS. GG genotype of this variation was more 
frequent in patients. mRNA expression of IL12B was upregulated in patients.
Expression of IL12B mRNA in both MS patients collectively and those with GG
genotype for rs6887695 SNP correlated negatively with onset age of MS patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The GG genotype of rs6887695 SNP in IL12B gene plays a role in
etiopathogenesis of MS.

development and driving inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We
report the effects and microbe-host interactions underlying an intervention using
fine powder of eggshell membrane (ESM) against IBD. ESM attenuated
lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory cytokine production and promoted the
Caco-2 cell proliferation by up-regulating growth factors in vitro. In a murine
model of dextran sodium sulphate-induced colitis, ESM significantly suppressed
the disease activity index and colon shortening. These effects were associated
with significant ameliorations of gene expressions of inflammatory mediators,
intestinal epithelial cell proliferation, restitution-related factors and
antimicrobial peptides. Multifaceted integrated omics analyses revealed improved 
levels of energy metabolism-related genes, proteins and metabolites.
Concomitantly, cecal metagenomic information established an essential role of ESM
in improving dysbiosis characterized by increasing the diversity of bacteria and 
decreasing absolute numbers of pathogenic bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae and
E. coli, as well as in the regulation of the expansion of Th17 cells by
suppressing the overgrowth of segmented filamentous bacteria. Such modulations
have functional effects on the host; i.e., repairing the epithelium, regulating
energy requirements and eventually alleviating mucosal inflammation. These
findings are first insights into ESM's modulation of microbiota and IBD
suppression, providing new perspectives on the prevention/treatment of IBD.

The objective of the study is to assess the predictive performance of three
different techniques as classifiers for extra-intestinal manifestations in 152
patients with Crohn's disease. Naïve Bayes, Bayesian Additive Regression Trees
and Bayesian Networks implemented using a Greedy Thick Thinning algorithm for
learning dependencies among variables and EM algorithm for learning conditional
probabilities associated to each variable are taken into account. Three sets of
variables were considered: (i) disease characteristics: presentation, behavior
and location (ii) risk factors: age, gender, smoke and familiarity and (iii)
genetic polymorphisms of the NOD2, CD14, TNFA, IL12B, and IL1RN genes, whose
involvement in Crohn's disease is known or suspected. Extra-intestinal
manifestations occurred in 75 patients. Bayesian Networks achieved accuracy of
82% when considering only clinical factors and 89% when considering also genetic 
information, outperforming the other techniques. CD14 has a small predicting
capability. Adding TNFA, IL12B to the 3020insC NOD2 variant improved the
accuracy.

BACKGROUND: Interleukin-10 (IL10) signaling plays an important role in the
pathogenesis of very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD) in
children. However, little is known about the role of the IL10 axis in children
with VEO-IBD in China.
METHODS: The Chinese VEO-IBD Collaboration Group was created to collect clinical 
and genetic data from patients deficient in IL10 and the IL10 receptor.
High-throughput sequencing was performed to identify mutations in these genes.
RESULTS: We identified 32 compound heterozygous mutations and 9 homozygous
mutations in IL10 receptor subunit alpha and 1 homozygous mutation in IL10
receptor subunit beta. Among these mutations, 10 novel mutations were identified,
and 6 pathogenic mutations had been previously described. In patients with IL10
receptor subunit alpha mutations, c.301C>T (p.R101RW) and c.537 G>A (p.T179T)
were the most common mutations. For 88.1% of the patients, the initial symptom
was diarrhea, with a time of onset of 10.4 ± 8.0 days. Oral ulcers were the first
symptom in 23.8% of the patients, with a time of onset of 9.7 ± 2.8 days.
Extraintestinal manifestations included perianal abscesses (22/42), perianal
fistulas (23/42), oral ulcers (20/42), and recurrent eczema (15/42). Twelve
patients underwent enterostomy. These patients also had lower average Z scores in
height-for-age and weight-for-age. Various treatment strategies were used,
including fecal microbiota transplantation; however, only hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation was efficacious.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified genotypes and phenotypes of Chinese VEO-IBD
infants with IL10 receptor mutations. Our study expands the current knowledge on 
the involvement of the IL10 axis in patients with VEO-IBD.

T-helper 17 (Th17) cells have important functions in adaptor immunity and have
also been implicated in inflammatory disorders. The bromodomain and extraterminal
domain (BET) family proteins regulate gene transcription during lineage-specific 
differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells to produce mature T-helper cells.
Inhibition of acetyl-lysine binding of the BET proteins by pan-BET bromodomain
(BrD) inhibitors, such as JQ1, broadly affects differentiation of Th17, Th1, and 
Th2 cells that have distinct immune functions, thus limiting their therapeutic
potential. Whether these BET proteins represent viable new epigenetic drug
targets for inflammatory disorders has remained an unanswered question. In this
study, we report that selective inhibition of the first bromodomain of BET
proteins with our newly designed small molecule MS402 inhibits primarily Th17
cell differentiation with a little or almost no effect on Th1 or Th2 and Treg
cells. MS402 preferentially renders Brd4 binding to Th17 signature gene loci over
those of housekeeping genes and reduces Brd4 recruitment of p-TEFb to
phosphorylate and activate RNA polymerase II for transcription elongation. We
further show that MS402 prevents and ameliorates T-cell transfer-induced colitis 
in mice by blocking Th17 cell overdevelopment. Thus, selective pharmacological
modulation of individual bromodomains likely represents a strategy for treatment 
of inflammatory bowel diseases.

The FANTOM5 consortium utilised cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) to provide
an unprecedented insight into transcriptional regulation in human cells and
tissues. In the current study, we have used CAGE-based transcriptional profiling 
on an extended dense time course of the response of human monocyte-derived
macrophages grown in macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF1) to bacterial
lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We propose that this system provides a model for the
differentiation and adaptation of monocytes entering the intestinal lamina
propria. The response to LPS is shown to be a cascade of successive waves of
transient gene expression extending over at least 48 hours, with hundreds of
positive and negative regulatory loops. Promoter analysis using motif activity
response analysis (MARA) identified some of the transcription factors likely to
be responsible for the temporal profile of transcriptional activation. Each
LPS-inducible locus was associated with multiple inducible enhancers, and in each
case, transient eRNA transcription at multiple sites detected by CAGE preceded
the appearance of promoter-associated transcripts. LPS-inducible long non-coding 
RNAs were commonly associated with clusters of inducible enhancers. We used these
data to re-examine the hundreds of loci associated with susceptibility to
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in genome-wide association studies. Loci
associated with IBD were strongly and specifically (relative to rheumatoid
arthritis and unrelated traits) enriched for promoters that were regulated in
monocyte differentiation or activation. Amongst previously-identified IBD
susceptibility loci, the vast majority contained at least one promoter that was
regulated in CSF1-dependent monocyte-macrophage transitions and/or in response to
LPS. On this basis, we concluded that IBD loci are strongly-enriched for
monocyte-specific genes, and identified at least 134 additional candidate genes
associated with IBD susceptibility from reanalysis of published GWA studies. We
propose that dysregulation of monocyte adaptation to the environment of the
gastrointestinal mucosa is the key process leading to inflammatory bowel disease.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: The microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles of the terminal
ileum, sigmoid colon, and rectal mucosa of adult patients with active Crohn's
disease (CD) have been previously reported. The purpose of this study was to
identify dysregulated miRNAs in the mucosa of the ascending colon.
METHODS: Biopsy tissue samples were taken from the mucosae of inflammatory (iCD) 
or noninflammatory (niCD) areas of the ascending colons of adult patients with
active CD. miRNA and mRNA expression profiles were detected using microarray
analyses. miRNAs and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) demonstrating significant differences
were validated via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Luciferase
reporter genes were used to measure two miRNAs inhibition of potential target
genes in human 293T cells in vitro.
RESULTS: Compared with the healthy control group, the ascending colon miRNA
expression profiles revealed that 43 miRNAs were significantly upregulated and 35
were downregulated in the iCD group. The mRNA expression profiles indicated that 
3370 transcripts were significantly differentially expressed in the ascending
colon, with 2169 upregulated and 1201 downregulated mRNAs in the iCD group, and
only 20 miRNAs demonstrated significant differential expression in the niCD
group. In contrast, nearly 100 miRNAs significantly varied between the iCD and
niCD groups. Finally, luciferase reporter gene assays showed that hsa-miR-16-1
directly regulated the human C10orf54 gene and that they were negatively
correlated.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that the differentially expressed miRNAs and
mRNAs were related to immune inflammation and intestinal flora. The data provide 
preliminary evidence that the occurrence of CD involves the inhibition of
C10orf54 expression by hsa-miR-16-1.

Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory disease with increasing
incidence and prevalence worldwide. In previous years, the accumulation of
microarray data has provided us an approach to obtain further insight into CD. In
the present study, the microarray data of CD was comprehensively analyzed using
multiple bioinformatics methods, and the pathobiological process of the disease
was examined. Gene expression data from colon tissues of patients with CD were
obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database; following which
differentially expressed genes were identified between CD and control sample
groups. Subsequently, Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
analyses were performed to investigate which functions and pathways in which the 
differentially expressed genes enriched. TargetScan and miRDB databases were then
used to predict which microRNAs (miRNAs) regulated the differentially expressed
genes. As a result, a total of 432 differentially expressed genes, including 229 
upregulated and 203 downregulated genes, including matrix metallopeptidase 3 and 
glutathione S‑transferase α1, were identified in CD samples. These differentially
expressed genes were significantly involved in regulation of the inflammatory
response, innate immune response, cell migration, extracellular matrix
organization, Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription
signaling pathway, and cytokine‑cytokine receptor interaction. The miRNA-gene
network showed that miR‑149‑3p and miR‑4447 regulated the most differentially
expressed genes. These findings extend current understanding of the mechanisms
underlying CD, and the differentially expressed genes and regulator miRNAs
identified may be used as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for CD.

BACKGROUND: Stricturing and penetrating complications account for substantial
morbidity and health-care costs in paediatric and adult onset Crohn's disease.
Validated models to predict risk for complications are not available, and the
effect of treatment on risk is unknown.
METHODS: We did a prospective inception cohort study of paediatric patients with 
newly diagnosed Crohn's disease at 28 sites in the USA and Canada. Genotypes,
antimicrobial serologies, ileal gene expression, and ileal, rectal, and faecal
microbiota were assessed. A competing-risk model for disease complications was
derived and validated in independent groups. Propensity-score matching tested the
effect of anti-tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) therapy exposure within 90 days of
diagnosis on complication risk.
FINDINGS: Between Nov 1, 2008, and June 30, 2012, we enrolled 913 patients, 78
(9%) of whom experienced Crohn's disease complications. The validated
competing-risk model included age, race, disease location, and antimicrobial
serologies and provided a sensitivity of 66% (95% CI 51-82) and specificity of
63% (55-71), with a negative predictive value of 95% (94-97). Patients who
received early anti-TNFα therapy were less likely to have penetrating
complications (hazard ratio [HR] 0·30, 95% CI 0·10-0·89; p=0·0296) but not
stricturing complication (1·13, 0·51-2·51; 0·76) than were those who did not
receive early anti-TNFα therapy. Ruminococcus was implicated in stricturing
complications and Veillonella in penetrating complications. Ileal genes
controlling extracellular matrix production were upregulated at diagnosis, and
this gene signature was associated with stricturing in the risk model (HR 1·70,
95% CI 1·12-2·57; p=0·0120). When this gene signature was included, the model's
specificity improved to 71%.
INTERPRETATION: Our findings support the usefulness of risk stratification of
paediatric patients with Crohn's disease at diagnosis, and selection of anti-TNFα
therapy.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells
(hucMSCs) in the treatment of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD).
RESULTS: ICG-hucMSCs homed to colon tissues of IBD mice 12 h after injection. The
injection of hucMSCs significantly relieved the IBD symptoms and inflammatory
cell infiltration. The expression of IL-10 gene increased while those of
15-LOX-1, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and IP-10 genes decreased in colon tissues and
spleens of hucMSCs-treated mice. The activation of STAT3 was inhibited in colon
tissues and spleens of IBD mice that were treated with hucMSCs. In addition, the 
percentage of macrophages decreased in colon tissues and spleens of
hucMSCs-treated IBD mice. Moreover, we provided evidence that in vitro co-culture

The Janus kinase/signal transduction and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT)
signaling pathway is implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory and
autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and inflammatory
bowel disease. Many cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and
inflammatory diseases use JAKs and STATs to transduce intracellular signals.
Mutations in JAK and STAT genes cause a number of immunodeficiency syndromes, and
polymorphisms in these genes are associated with autoimmune diseases. The success
of small-molecule JAK inhibitors (Jakinibs) in the treatment of rheumatologic
disease demonstrates that intracellular signaling pathways can be targeted
therapeutically to treat autoimmunity. Tofacitinib, the first rheumatologic
Jakinib, is US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for rheumatoid
arthritis and is currently under investigation for other autoimmune diseases.
Many other Jakinibs are in preclinical development or in various phases of
clinical trials. This review describes the JAK-STAT pathway, outlines its role in
autoimmunity, and explains the rationale/pre-clinical evidence for targeting
JAK-STAT signaling. The safety and clinical efficacy of the Jakinibs are
reviewed, starting with the FDA-approved Jakinib tofacitinib, and continuing on
to next-generation Jakinibs. Recent and ongoing studies are emphasized, with a
focus on emerging indications for JAK inhibition and novel mechanisms of JAK-STAT
signaling blockade.

Objective: To investigate the association of ulcerative colitis (UC) with fork
head/winged helix transcription factor-3 (Foxp3) polymorphisms in Han population 
in Zhejiang province, China. Methods: A total of 381 UC patients and 490 healthy 
controls were enrolled in this study.The four single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) of Foxp3 (rs3761547, rs2232365, rs2294021, rs3761548) were examined by
SNaPshot.The analyses of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and haplotype were also
performed in all study subjects. Results: When male and female UC patients were
compared with their corresponding controls respectively, the alleles and
genotypes of the four SNPs were not statistically different (all P>0.05).
According to severity and location of the disease, the UC patients were divided
into different subgroups. The alleles (C, G, A) of (rs2232365, rs2294021,
rs3761548) were more frequent in male patients with severe UC than in the male
controls (69.6% vs 34.3%, P=0.001; 69.6% vs 34.3%, P=0.001; 39.1% vs 14.4%,
P=0.002, respectively). As compared with the female controls, the alleles (C, G, 
A) and genotypes (TC+ CC, AG+ GG, CA+ AA) of (rs2232365, rs2294021, rs3761548)
were significantly increased in the female patients with severe UC (51.9% vs
38.0%, 63.5% vs 39.2%, 53.8% vs 21.4%, 80.8% vs 57.7%, 84.6% vs 58.4%, 76.9% vs
34.7%, all P<0.05). The four SNPs above were shown to be in a strong LD both in
male and in female subjects.When male and female UC patients were compared with
their corresponding controls respectively, nevertheless, each haplotype frequency
was not statistically different (all P>0.05). Conclusions:Foxp3 (rs2232365,
rs2294021, rs3761548) variations might engender the increased risk of severe UC
in Chinese Han patients.

(69.6%比34.3%，P＝0.001；69.6%比34.3%，P＝0.001；39.1%比14.4%，P＝0.002)。与女性对照组相比，女性重度UC患者中不
仅rs2232365、rs2294021、rs3761548的等位基因C、G、A频率更高(51.9%比38.0%，P＝0.049；63.5%比39.2%，P＝0.
001；53.8%比21.4%，P<0.001)，而且基因型(TC＋CC)、(AG＋GG)、(CA＋AA)的频率亦更高(80.8%比57.7%，P＝0.022；8
4.6%比58.4%，P＝0.009；76.9%比34.7%，P<0.001)。虽然上述4种SNP彼此紧密连锁，但男、女性UC组分别与男、女性对照组比较，各单倍型

AIM: To explore the mechanism by which microRNA-155 (miR-155) regulates the
pathogenesis of experimental colitis.
METHODS: A luciferase assay was performed to confirm the binding of miR-155 to
the SHIP-1 3'-UTR. MiR-155 mimics, negative controls and SHIP-1
expression/knockdown vectors were established and then utilized in gain- and
loss-of-function studies performed in raw264.7 cells and primary bone
marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Thereafter, dextran sulfate sodium
(DSS)-induced colitis mouse model with or without antagomiR-155 treatment was
established, and the levels of miR-155 and SHIP-1, as well as the
pro-inflammatory capabilities, were measured by western blot, quantitative
polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: MiR-155 directly bound to the 3'-UTR of SHIP-1 mRNA and induced a
significant decrease in SHIP-1 expression in both raw264.7 cells and primary
BMDMs. MiR-155 markedly promoted cell proliferation and pro-inflammatory
secretions including IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IFN-γ, whereas these effects could
be reversed by the restoration of SHIP-1 expression. In vivo studies showed that 
antagomiR-155 administration could alleviate DSS-induced intestinal inflammation 
in Balb/c mice. Moreover, significantly increased SHIP-1 expression, as well as
decreased Akt activation and inflammatory response, were observed in the
antagomiR-155-treated mice.
CONCLUSION: MiR-155 promotes experimental colitis by repressing SHIP-1
expression. Thus, the inhibition of miR-155 might be a promising strategy for
therapy.

Pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.

[Article in English, Japanese]

Hibi T, Kobayashi T, Hisamatsu T.

The causes of IBD (inflammatory bowel disease), ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
disease, have not been elucidated. It is thought that the pathogenesis involves
genetic predisposition, environmental factors and host immune response to food
antigens and microbiota. Most of IBD susceptiblity genes are related to function 
of immune cells, maintenance of homeostasis of epithelial cells, autophagy, ER
stress and so on. These genetic abnormalities may induce abnormal immune response
to antigens and intestinal bacteria, which are modified by diet habit and hygiene
environment. Recently, the interrelationship between intestinal bacteria and
hosts has dramatically been elucidated, and breakdown of the homeostatic
mechanisms at the cellular level is revealed to have an important role in the
onset of IBD.

BACKGROUND: IL12B is a promising candidate for a susceptibility gene in Crohn's
disease (CD). The aim of this study was to perform a candidate gene analysis of
IL12B in Japanese CD patients, investigate whether the genotype is associated
with disease phenotypes, and determine how the risk allele affects susceptibility
to CD.
METHODS: Three hundred seventy-five patients with CD, 265 patients with
ulcerative colitis, and 463 healthy controls were examined. Ten single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) around IL12B were genotyped. Case-control and subphenotype
(including disease course) analyses were performed. The allelic expression ratio 
of IL12B messenger RNA (mRNA) was examined by a SNaPshot analysis in
lipopolysaccharide-stimulated monocytes.
RESULTS: Four SNPs located upstream of the IL12B gene were significantly
associated with CD. A conditional analysis revealed that these associations
included two independent signals tagged by IL12B_1 and IL12B_3 (P = 9.42 × 10-6
and  1.49 × 10-4 respectively). IL12B_3 was also associated with earlier relapse 
in CD (P = 0.0144). The allelic expression ratios of IL12B mRNA transcribed from 
the risk haplotype to the protective haplotype tagged by IL12B_3 in
lipopolysaccharide-stimulated monocytes from ten healthy controls heterozygous
for IL12B_3 were significantly higher than that of the respective genomic DNA
(P = 0.00923). No SNP was associated with ulcerative colitis.
CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed the association of SNPs located upstream of IL12B with 
CD in Japanese patients. The demonstrated allelic expression imbalance supports
the idea that the IL12B risk haplotype confers susceptibility not only to CD
onset but to also relapse through increased IL12B mRNA expression.

BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) only involves the colonic mucosa. Yet, nearly
50% of patients with UC who undergo total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal
anastomosis develop UC-like inflammation of the ileal pouch (pouchitis). By
contrast, patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) with ileal pouch
anal anastomosis develop pouchitis far less frequently. We hypothesized that
pathogenic events associated with the development of UC are recapitulated by
colonic-metaplastic transcriptomic reprogramming of the UC pouch.
METHODS: We prospectively sampled pouch and prepouch ileum mucosal biopsies in
patients with UC with ileal pouch anal anastomosis 4, 8, and 12 months after
their pouch was in continuity. Mucosal samples were also obtained from patients
with FAP. Transcriptional profiles of the UC and FAP pouch and prepouch ileum
were investigated via RNA sequencing and compared with data from a previously
published microarray study.
RESULTS: Unlike patients with FAP, subjects with UC exhibited a large set of
differentially expressed genes between the pouch and prepouch ileum as early as 4
months after pouch functionalization. Functional pathway analysis of
differentially expressed genes in the UC pouch revealed an enhanced state of
immune/inflammatory response and extracellular matrix remodeling. Moreover, >70% 
of differentially expressed genes mapped to published inflammatory bowel diseases
microarray data sets displayed directional changes consistent with active UC but 
not with Crohn's disease.
CONCLUSIONS: The UC pouch, well before histologic inflammation, already displays 
a systems-level gain of colon-associated genes and loss of ileum-associated
genes. Patients with UC exhibit a unique transcriptomic response to ileal pouch
creation that can be observed well before disease and may in part explain their
susceptibility to the development of pouchitis.

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which comprise Crohn's disease and ulcerative 
colitis, are chronic intestinal disorders with an increased prevalence and
incidence over the last decade in many different regions over the world. The
etiology of IBD is still not well defined, but evidence suggest that it results
from perturbation of the homeostasis between the intestinal microbiota and the
mucosal immune system, with the involvement of both genetic and environmental
factors. Genome wide association studies, which involve large-scale genome-wide
screening of potential polymorphism, have identified several mutations associated
with IBD. Among them, Card9, a gene encoding an adapter molecule involved in
innate immune response to fungi (via type C-lectin sensing) through the
activation of IL-22 signaling pathway, has been identified as one IBD susceptible
genes. Dietary compounds, which represent a source of energy and metabolites for 
gut bacteria, are also appreciated to be important actors in the etiology of IBD,
for example by altering gut microbiota composition and by regulating the
generation of short chain fatty acids. A noteworthy study published in the June
2016 issue of Nature Medicine by Lamas and colleagues investigates the
interaction between Card9 and the gut microbiota in the generation of the
microbiota-derived tryptophan metabolite. This study highlights the role of
tryptophan in dampening intestinal inflammation in susceptible hosts.

AIM: To investigate the association of seven single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) of the IL23R gene with the clinical picture of ulcerative colitis (UC).
METHODS: Genomic DNA samples of 131 patients (66 males, 65 females, mean age 55.4
± 15.8 years) with Caucasian origin, diagnosed with UC were investigated. The
diagnosis of UC was based on the established clinical, endoscopic, radiological, 
and histopathological guidelines. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood
leukocytes by routine salting out method. Polymerase chain reaction and
restriction fragment length polymorphism were used to identify the alleles of
seven SNPs of IL23R gene (rs11209026, rs10889677, rs1004819, rs2201841,
rs7517847, rs10489629, rs7530511).
RESULTS: Four out of seven analyzed SNPs had statistically significant influence 
on the clinical picture of UC. Two SNPs were associated with greater colonic
extension (rs2201841 P = 0.0084; rs10489629 P = 0.0405). For two of the SNPs,
there was more frequently need for operations (rs2201841 P = 0.0348, OR = 8.0;
rs10889677 P = 0.0347, OR = 8.0). The rs2201841 showed to be a risk factor for
the development of iron deficiency (P = 0.0388, OR = 6.1837). For patients with
the rs10889677, a therapy with azathioprine was more frequently necessary (P =
0.0116, OR = 6.1707). Patients with rs10489629 SNP had a lower risk for weight
loss (P = 0.0169, OR = 0.3394). Carriers of the heterozygous variant had a higher
risk for an extended disease (P = 0.0284). The rs7517847 showed a protective
character leading to mild bowel movements. Three SNPs demonstrated no
statistically significant influence on any examined clinical features of UC.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrated susceptible or protective character of the
investigated IL23R SNPs on the phenotype of UC, confirming the genetic
association.

The Pregnane and Xenobiotic Receptor (PXR; NR1I2) is a ligand-modulated
transcription factor that belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily. It is
expressed at higher levels primarily in liver and intestine as compared to the
levels in several other organs. It is activated by a broad spectrum of
xenobiotics and endobiotics. The primary function of PXR is to regulate the
expression of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters and prevent the
accumulation of toxic chemicals in the body, thereby maintaining body's
homeostasis. In this study, we identified a C/T single nucleotide polymorphism at
position -831 from the transcriptional start site of the PXR gene promoter and
examined the functional significance of this variant using both the luciferase
reporter gene assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). Transient 
transfection experiments showed that the T-allele was associated with
significantly greater transcriptional activity than the C-allele of SNP
rs3814055. These results indicate that the -831C/T polymorphism has a direct
effect on transcriptional regulation of PXR gene. This allelic variation may be a
potential genetic marker that can help identify individuals at higher risk for
Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).

Crohn's disease (CD) involves chronic inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract 
due to dysregulation of the host immune response to the gut microbiome. Even
though the host-microbiome interactions are likely contributors to the
development of CD, a few studies have detected genetic variants that change
bacterial compositions and increase CD risk. We focus on one of the
well-replicated susceptible genes, tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 15
(TNFSF15), and apply statistical analyses for personal profiles of genotypes and 
salivary microbiota collected from CD cases and controls in the Ryukyu Islands,
southernmost islands of the Japanese archipelago. Our association test confirmed 
the susceptibility of TNFSF15 in the Ryukyu Islands. We found that the recessive 
model was supported to fit the observed genotype frequency of risk alleles
slightly better than the additive model, defining the genetic effect on CD if a
pair of the chromosomes in an individual consists of all risk alleles. The
combined analysis of haplotypes and salivary microbiome from a small set of
samples showed a significant association of the genetic effect with the increase 
of Prevotella, which led to a significant increase of CD risk. However, the
genetic effect on CD disappeared if the abundance of Prevotella was low,
suggesting the genetic contribution to CD is conditionally independent given a
fixed amount of Prevotella. Although our statistical power is limited due to the 
small sample size, these results support an idea that the genetic susceptibility 
of TNFSF15 to CD may be confounded, in part, by the increase of Prevotella.

BACKGROUND: Distinct gene expression profiles in peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMCs) consistent with increased sympathetic nervous system activity have 
been described in different populations under chronic stress. Neuroinflammatory
brain changes, possibly related to the migration of primed monocytes to the
brain, have been implicated in the pathophysiology of chronic pain. Irritable
bowel syndrome (IBS) is a stress-sensitive gastrointestinal disorder associated
with altered brain-gut interactions and increased sympathetic/vagal tone and
anxiety. Reports about immune alterations in IBS are conflicting. This pilot
study aimed to test how PBMC gene expression inflammatory profiles are correlated
with altered brain signatures in the salience system.
METHODS: Sixteen IBS and 16 healthy controls (HCs) completed resting state MRI
scans. Gene expression profiles in PBMCs were assessed using human transcriptome 
array-2. Bioinformatic analyses determined differential expression of PBMCs
between IBS and HCs. Partial least squares, a multivariate analysis technique,
was used to identify disease correlations between PBMC gene expression profiles
and functional activity in the brain's salience network.
KEY RESULTS: Regions of the salience network, including the mid cingulate cortex,
and mid and superior temporal gyrus were positively correlated with several
pro-inflammatory genes (interleukin 6, APOL2) in IBS, but negatively correlated
with several anti-inflammatory genes (KRT8, APOA4) in HCs.
CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Based on rodent studies, one may speculate that
chronically activated stress signaling pathways in IBS maintain a
pro-inflammatory state in the periphery. Alternatively, primed monocytes may
migrate to the brain during stress, inducing regional neuroinflammatory changes
in salience regions involved in the modulation of visceral sensitivity.

Oxidative stress is involved in pathophysiology and pathological conditions of
numerous human diseases. Thus, understanding the mechanisms underlying the redox 
homeostasis in cells and organs is valuable for discovery of therapeutic drugs
for oxidative stress-related diseases. Recently, by applying chemical biology
approach with an ARE activator, BTZO-1, we found macrophage migration inhibitory 
factor (MIF) as a new regulator of antioxidant response element- (ARE-) mediated 
gene transcription. BTZO-1 and its active derivatives bound to MIF and protected 
cells and organs from oxidative insults via ARE activation in animal models with 
oxidative stress such as ischemia/reperfusion injury, inflammatory bowel
diseases, and septic shock. In this review, we briefly highlight key findings in 
understanding the MIF-ARE system.

The miR-29 family is involved in fibrosis in multiple organs, including the
intestine where miR-29b facilitates TGF-β-mediated up-regulation of collagen in
mucosal fibroblasts from Crohn's disease (CD) patients. Myeloid cell leukemia-1
(MCL-1), a member of the B-cell CLL/Lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) apoptosis family, is
involved in liver fibrosis and is targeted by miR-29b via its 3'-UTR in cultured 
cell lines. We investigate the role of MCL-1 and miR-29b in primary intestinal
fibroblasts and tissue from stricturing CD patients. Transfection of CD
intestinal fibroblasts with pre-miR-29b resulted in a significant increase in the
mRNA expression of MCL-1 isoforms [MCL-1Long (L)/Extra Short (ES) and MCL-1Short 
(S)], although MCL-1S was expressed at significantly lower levels. Western
blotting predominantly detected the anti-apoptotic MCL-1L isoform, and
immunofluorescence showed that staining was localised in discrete nuclear foci.
Transfection with pre-miR-29b or anti-miR-29b resulted in a significant increase 
or decrease, respectively, in MCL-1L foci. CD fibroblasts treated with IL-6 and
IL-8, inflammatory cytokines upstream of MCL-1, increased the total mass of
MCL-1L-positive foci. Furthermore, transfection of intestinal fibroblasts with
pre-miR-29b resulted in an increase in mRNA and protein levels of IL-6 and IL-8. 
Finally, immunohistochemistry showed reduced MCL-1 protein expression in fibrotic
CD samples compared to non-stricturing controls. Together, our findings suggest
that induction of MCL-1 by IL-6/IL-8 may surmount any direct down-regulation by
miR-29b via its 3'-UTR. We propose that an anti-fibrotic miR-29b/IL-6 IL-8/MCL-1L
axis may influence intestinal fibrosis in CD. In the future, therapeutic
modulation of this pathway might contribute to the management of fibrosis in CD.

Changes in the gastrointestinal microbial community are frequently associated
with chronic diseases such as Inflammatory Bowel Diseases. However, understanding
the relationship of any individual taxon within the community to host physiology 
is made complex due to the diversity and individuality of the gut microbiota.
Defined microbial communities such as the Altered Schaedler Flora (ASF) help
alleviate the challenges of a diverse microbiota by allowing one to interrogate
the relationship between individual bacterial species and host responses. An
important aspect of studying these relationships with defined microbial
communities is the ability to measure the population abundance and dynamics of
each member. Herein, we describe the development of an improved ASF
species-specific and sensitive real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction
(qPCR) for use with SYBR Green chemistry to accurately assess individual ASF
member abundance. This approach targets hypervariable regions V1 through V3 of
the 16S rRNA gene of each ASF taxon to enhance assay specificity. We demonstrate 
the reproducibility, sensitivity and application of this new method by
quantifying each ASF bacterium in two inbred mouse lines. We also used it to
assess changes in ASF member abundance before and after acute antibiotic
perturbation of the community as well as in mice fed two different diets.
Additionally, we describe a nested PCR assay for the detection of lowly abundant 
ASF members. Altogether, this improved qPCR method will facilitate gnotobiotic
research involving the ASF community by allowing for reproducible quantification 
of its members under various physiological conditions.

Aberrant O-glycosylation of serum immunoglobulin A1 (IgA1) represents a heritable
pathogenic defect in IgA nephropathy, the most common form of glomerulonephritis 
worldwide, but specific genetic factors involved in its determination are not
known. We performed a quantitative GWAS for serum levels of galactose-deficient
IgA1 (Gd-IgA1) in 2,633 subjects of European and East Asian ancestry and
discovered two genome-wide significant loci, in C1GALT1 (rs13226913, P = 3.2 x
10-11) and C1GALT1C1 (rs5910940, P = 2.7 x 10-8). These genes encode molecular
partners essential for enzymatic O-glycosylation of IgA1. We demonstrated that
these two loci explain approximately 7% of variability in circulating Gd-IgA1 in 
Europeans, but only 2% in East Asians. Notably, the Gd-IgA1-increasing allele of 
rs13226913 is common in Europeans, but rare in East Asians. Moreover, rs13226913 
represents a strong cis-eQTL for C1GALT1 that encodes the key enzyme responsible 
for the transfer of galactose to O-linked glycans on IgA1. By in vitro siRNA
knock-down studies, we confirmed that mRNA levels of both C1GALT1 and C1GALT1C1
determine the rate of secretion of Gd-IgA1 in IgA1-producing cells. Our findings 
provide novel insights into the genetic regulation of O-glycosylation and are
relevant not only to IgA nephropathy, but also to other complex traits associated
with O-glycosylation defects, including inflammatory bowel disease, hematologic
disease, and cancer.

This meta-analysis examined the relationship between IL-17A (rs2275913) and IL17F
(rs763780 T/C) gene polymorphisms and the risk of inflammatory diseases,
including periodontitis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and inflammatory bowel
disease. PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Elsevier Science Direct
were searched, and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were
calculated to estimate the strength of the association. A total of 25 studies
comprising 7,474 cases and 10,628 controls were included. Significant
associations were found between inflammatory diseases and IL-17A rs2275913 A
versus G allele (OR = 1.197, P = 0.033) and the GA versus GG genotype in the
codominant model (OR = 1.406, P = 0.036). Our findings suggested that individuals
who carry the rs2275913 A allele or GA genotype have a 20% or 41%-increased risk 
of inflammatory diseases compared with subjects with the G allele or GG genotype,
respectively. With respect to IL-17F rs763780, the C versus T allele (OR = 1.94; 
P = 0.040), the TC versus TT (OR = 1.39; P = 0.041), the CC versus TT (OR = 2.71;
P = 0.003), as well as the TC + CC versus TT genotype (OR = 1.83; P = 0.032) were
risk factors for RA. In summary, our pooled analysis indicated that the IL-17A
(rs2275913) and IL17F (rs763780 T/C) increased the RA risk.

BACKGROUND: Cis-palmitoleic acid (Omega-7 fatty acid) is a monounsaturated fatty 
acid (MUFA) associated with anti-inflammatory process through specific protein
interactions such as HNF4γ and HNF4α, these two genes are related to the immune
response in ulcerative colitis (UC) they may act as a mediator of
anti-inflammatory action. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of
Cis-palmitoleic acid supplementation on inflammatory activity and the expression 
of genes HNF4γ, HNF4α and IL6 in the colonic mucosa of patients with active UC.
METHODS: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study was conducted
in 20 patients with UC. A dose of 720 mg/day of Cis-palmitoleic acid was orally
administered during 8 weeks and Mayo Clinic score was used for the assessment of 
clinical activity in UC before and after treatment with Cis-palmitoleic acid and 
placebo.
RESULTS: A total of 20 patients with UC were randomized to receive
Cis-palmitoleic acid or placebo. Significant changes in the biochemical markers
of inflammation were found in UC patients before and after treatment with
Cis-palmitoleic acid vs. placebo such as total protein (P=0.02), hs-CRP (P=0.04) 
and ESR (P<0.05). The gene expression of HNF4γ and HNF4α were found to be
increased in the Cis-palmitoleic acid group compared to placebo group (P=0.05 and
P=0.07 respectively) as well as significant reduction upon IL6 expression in the 
Cis-palmitoleic acid group (P=0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: Cis-palmitoleic acid as co-adjuvant therapy for 8 weeks seems to
decrease the inflammatory activity through the increased expression of HNF4α and 
HNF4γ in patients with UC.

Intestinal inflammation is associated with low levels of mucosal ATP,
highlighting the importance of mitochondrial function associated with ATP
production in the pathophysiology of the disease. In the inflamed colon of humans
and mice, we found decreased levels of mitochondrial complex cytochrome c oxidase
I/IV and lower ATP levels. Thus, we generated colonic ρ0 cells with reduced
mitochondrial function linked to ATP production by selective depletion of
mitochondrial DNA. In these cells, RNA sequencing revealed a substantial number
of differentially expressed transcripts, among which 240 belonged to inflammatory
pathways activated in human inflamed colon and TNF-α-treated cells (false
discovery rate < 0.05). TNF-α treatment of colonic ρ0 cells augmented IL-8
expression by 9-fold (P < 0.01) via NF-κB compared to TNF-α-treated control.
Moreover, reduced mitochondrial function facilitated TNF-α-mediated NF-κB
luciferase promoter activity as a result of lowered inhibitory IκBα (nuclear
factor of κ light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cell inhibitor, α), leading to
elevated NF-κB. In cells with reduced mitochondrial function, TNF-α facilitated
AMPKα2 activation by 8-fold (P < 0.01), which was involved in NF-κB-dependent
IL-8 expression. Last, in human and mouse colon, anti-TNF-α treatment restored
reduced mitochondria-dependent inflammation. We propose that selective targeting 
of this novel mechanism provides new treatment opportunities for intestinal
inflammation.-Heller, S., Penrose, H. M., Cable, C., Biswas, D., Nakhoul, H.,

Inflammation plays an important role in maintaining the body's homeostasis. It
repairs the damaged tissues of the body resulting from injury or infection. In
addition, a diverse array of diseases like hepatitis, arthritis and colitis has
been reported and described to be associated with inflammatory processes. Some
autoimmune diseases like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) emerge by the influence
of numerous genes in complex environmental situations belong to inflammation. The
currently available processes for curing inflammation and related disorders
facilitate the use of non steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Moreover,
intolerable side effects are also associated with the consumption of these
medications. It is well known that phenolic compounds, largely present in
vegetables and fruits, serve as an integral part of normal human diet besides
having great medicinal value. These are considered to reflect a variety of
anti-inflammatory properties, and can be used as an alternate natural source for 
the prevention of chronic inflammatory disorders. This mini-review summarized the
antiinflammatory benefits of plants derived very prominent dietary polyphenolic
compounds particularly, Oleocanthal, Curcumin, Resveratrol and Quercetin.

Cysteine catabolism presents cells with a double-edged sword. On the one hand,
cysteine degradation provides cells with essential molecules such as taurine and 
sulfide. The formation of sulfide in cells is thought to regulate important and
diverse physiological processes including blood circulation, synaptic activity
and inflammation. On the other hand, the catabolism of cysteine by gut microbiota
can release high levels of sulfide that may underlie the development or relapse
of ulcerative colitis, an inflammatory bowel disease affecting millions of people
worldwide. Here, we have used the nematode C. elegans to explore how cells
tolerate high levels of sulfide produced by cysteine degradation in bacteria. We 
have identified mutations in genes coding for thioredoxin family proteins,
mitochondrial proteins, and collagens that confer tolerance to sulfide toxicity. 
Exposure to sulfide induces the unfolded protein response in the endoplasmic
reticulum and mitochondria. Moreover, our results suggest that sulfide toxicity
is mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Indeed, pre-treatment of worms with
antioxidants increases their tolerance to sulfide toxicity. Intriguingly,
sub-toxic levels of the superoxide generator paraquat can also increase the
tolerance of worms to sulfide. Therefore, it appears that activation of ROS
detoxification pathway prior to the exposure to sulfide, can increase the
tolerance to sulfide toxicity. Our results suggest that these detoxification
pathways are mediated by the hypoxia inducible factor HIF-1. Finally, we show
that sulfide resistance varies among wild C. elegans and other nematode species, 
suggesting that tolerance to sulfide was naturally selected in certain habitats.

Bile acids regulate the expression of intestinal bile acid transporters and are
natural ligands for nuclear receptors controlling inflammation. Accumulating
evidence suggests that signaling through these receptors is impaired in
inflammatory bowel disease. We investigated whether tauroursodeoxycholic acid
(TUDCA), a secondary bile acid with cytoprotective properties, regulates ileal
nuclear receptor and bile acid transporter expression and assessed its
therapeutic potential in an experimental model of Crohn's disease (CD). Gene
expression of the nuclear receptors farnesoid X receptor, pregnane X receptor and
vitamin D receptor and the bile acid transporters apical sodium-dependent bile
acid transporter and organic solute transporter α and β was analyzed in Caco-2
cell monolayers exposed to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, in ileal tissue of
TNFΔARE/WT mice and in inflamed ileal biopsies from CD patients by quantitative
real-time polymerase chain reaction. TNFΔARE/WT mice and wild-type littermates
were treated with TUDCA or placebo for 11 weeks and ileal histopathology and
expression of the aforementioned genes were determined. Exposing Caco-2 cell
monolayers to TNFα impaired the mRNA expression of nuclear receptors and bile
acid transporters, whereas co-incubation with TUDCA antagonized their
downregulation. TNFΔARE/WT mice displayed altered ileal bile acid homeostasis
that mimicked the situation in human CD ileitis. Administration of TUDCA
attenuated ileitis and alleviated the downregulation of nuclear receptors and
bile acid transporters in these mice. These results show that TUDCA protects bile
acid homeostasis under inflammatory conditions and suppresses CD-like ileitis.
Together with previous observations showing similar efficacy in experimental
colitis, we conclude that TUDCA could be a promising therapeutic agent for
inflammatory bowel disease, warranting a clinical trial.

Genes, bacteria, and immunity contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory
bowel disease. Most genetic risk relates to defective sensing of microbes and
their metabolites or defective regulation of the host response to the microbiota.
Because the composition of the microbiota shapes the developing immune system and
is determined in early life, the prospect of therapeutic manipulation of the
microbiota in adulthood after the onset of disease is questionable. However, the 
microbiota may be a marker of risk and a modifier of disease activity and a
contributor to extraintestinal manifestations and associations in some patients
with inflammatory bowel disease.

BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is originated from uncontrolled
inflammation, and desired methods for IBD therapy remains the main difficult. The
network comprised with miRNA and lncRNA has been verified to play an important
role on diverse human diseases. In this study, we demonstrated the role of
miR-34c and lncRNA PlncRNA1 on the function of intestinal barrier.
METHODS: Intestinal epithelial barrier model was constructed based on normal
intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2. 2% DSS was supplemented in the Apical
side of the model cells to induce the injury of intestinal epithelial barrier.
Real-time PCR or western blot was used to determine mRNA or protein expression of
miR-34c, PlncRNA1, Myc-associated zinc finger protein (MAZ), zonula occludens 1
(ZO-1) and occludin.
RESULTS: DSS induced injury of intestinal epithelial barrier, while
overexpression of PlncRNA1 seemed to protect intestinal epithelial barrier from
injury. Tight junction (TJ) proteins ZO-1 and occludin were regulated by MAZ,
while, miR-34c targeted MAZ to regulate its expression, in addition, PlncRNA1 and
miR-34c bound together to regulate the expressions of MAZ, ZO-1 and occludin. The
protect effects of PlncRNA1 overexpression on intestinal epithelial barrier
function was reversed by overexpression of miR-34c.
CONCLUSION: MAZ and TJ proteins were involved in the function of intestinal
epithelial barrier, while miR-34c and PlncRNA1 regulated the intestinal
dysfunction cooperatively.

Genome-wide association studies have identified autophagy-related susceptibility 
genes for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however, whether autophagy regulators
can be utilized as therapeutic targets remains unclear. To identify novel
microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)-interacting proteins in
intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), we isolated primary IECs from green
fluorescent protein (GFP)-LC3 mice. We performed immunoprecipitation with a GFP
antibody and then analyzed co-immunoprecipitates by mass spectrometry. HADHA was 
identified as an LC3-interacting protein from primary IECs. The HADHA gene
encodes the alpha subunit of the mitochondrial trifunctional protein. Given that 
HADHA catalyzes the last three steps of mitochondrial beta-oxidation of
long-chain fatty acids, we investigated whether long-chain fatty acids induce
autophagy in IECs. We found that palmitic acid induced autophagy in DLD-1, HT29, 
and HCT116 cells. HADHA was expressed in not only the mitochondria but also the
cytosol. LC3 puncta co-localized with HADHA, which were enhanced by palmitic acid
stimulation. However, LC3 puncta did not co-localize with Tom20, suggesting that 
HADHA was induced to associate with LC3 puncta at sites other than the
mitochondria. Thus, HADHA may have extra-mitochondrial functions. Furthermore, we
found that palmitic acid induced cell death in IECs, which was accelerated by
bafilomycin A and chloroquine. These findings suggested that palmitic
acid-induced autophagy supports the survival of IECs. Taken together, these
results suggested that HADHA is involved in long-chain fatty acid-induced
autophagy in IECs, thus providing new insights into the pathology of IBD and
revealing novel therapeutic targets of IBD.

Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been recently used in
clinical treatment of inflammatory diseases. Practical strategies improving the
immunosuppressive property of MSCs are urgently needed for MSC immunotherapy. In 
this study, we aimed to develop a microRNA-based strategy to improve MSC
immunotherapy. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that let-7a targeted the 3' UTR of
mRNA of Fas and FasL, both of which are essential for MSCs to induce T cell
apoptosis. Knockdown of let-7a by specific inhibitor doubled Fas and Fas ligand
(FasL) protein levels in MSCs. Because Fas attracts T cell migration and FasL
induces T cell apoptosis, knockdown of let-7a significantly promoted MSC-induced 
T cell migration and apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, MSCs knocked
down of let-7a were more efficient to reduce the mortality, prevent the weight
loss, suppress the inflammation reaction, and alleviate the tissue lesion of
experimental colitis and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) mouse models. In
conclusion, knockdown of let-7a significantly improved the therapeutic effect of 
MSC cytotherapy on inflammatory bowel diseases and GVHD. With high safety and
convenience, knockdown of let-7a is a potential strategy to improve MSC therapy
for inflammatory diseases in clinic.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a progressive biliary 
liver disorder strongly associated with inflammatory bowel disease (PSC-IBD). We 
summarize the genetics of PSC-IBD and highlight recent findings that further
differentiate PSC-IBD as a unique disease.
RECENT FINDINGS: To date, genome-wide studies have uncovered 23 susceptibility
loci for PSC-IBD, the majority of which have been previously reported as risk
factors in other immune-mediated disorders. For most candidates, the pathological
relationship to PSC-IBD remains largely unknown. Several candidate genes appear
to be liver related but the large majority relate to immunity and reaffirm that
alterations to immune function, trafficking, and tolerance are likely to
influence susceptibility and presentation of PSC-IBD. Similar to most
immune-mediated diseases, the strongest association in PSC-IBD resides within the
human leukocyte antigen complex and suggests that disease-specific antigens drive
pathogenic immune responses. Although genetic predisposition influences disease, 
genetic determinants account for less than 10% of total disease liability in
PSC-IBD, clearly emphasizing the predominant role of environmental factors on
disease susceptibility.
SUMMARY: Genetic studies define PSC-IBD as a unique disease to IBD mirroring
clinical observations. Most risk loci harbour immune-related genes and disease
variants are likely to perturb immune function, tolerance, and/or trafficking.
Additional studies in patients and novel experimental systems are needed to
identify the origin and impact of environmental factors in relation to genetic
predisposition in PSC-IBD.

Evaluation of Effect CAT -262C/T, SOD + 35A/C, GPx1 Pro197Leu Polymorphisms in
Patients with IBD in the Polish Population.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are a heterogeneous group of disorders in the
course dominated by chronic, recurrent gastrointestinal inflammation. It is
believed that the activation of IBD occurs in patients with a genetic
predisposition to their development. Chronic inflammation develops as a result of
an excessive reaction of the immune system principally under the influence of
environmental risk factors. Among them, it has been shown that the mechanism of
oxidative stress is associated with the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel
disease, responsible for the commencement and progress of these diseases. The aim
of the study was the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
of individual antioxidant enzymes, and the prevalence of inflammatory bowel
disease that may be associated with increased levels of oxidative stress.MATERIAL
AND METHODS: A total of 111 IBD patients, including 65 patients with ulcerative
colitis (UC) and 46 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 125 healthy controls recruited 
from the Polish population, were genotyped for CAT -262C / T (rs1001179), SOD +
35A / C (rs2234694), GPx Pro 197 Leu polymorphisms. Genotyping of CAT, SOD, GPx
gene polymorphism was performed by a RFLP-PCR.
RESULTS: The performed analysis of genetic polymorphisms of antioxidant enzymes
showed that polymorphic variant of the CAT -262 C / T may have protective effects
in patients with ulcerative colitis in the range of genotype C / T; OR = 0.49
(0.25-0.99), p = 0.044. Trend protective, but statistically unrelated, it was
also observed for genotype T / T and T allele of the same polymorphism and
genotypes and alleles + 35A / C SOD1 in UC as well as polymorphic variants CAT
-262 C / T, Pro197Leu of GPx1, + 35A / C SOD1 in CD. The results were compared
with a control group of potentially healthy individuals without such diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: It has been shown that the polymorphism of antioxidant enzymes CAT
gene -262 C / T may have protective effects in patients who are carriers of a
genotype C / T at the UC. The potential protective effect without statistical
relationships were also observed for other genotypes and alleles studied
polymorphic variants of antioxidant enzymes in CD and CAT- 262C / T and + 35 A / 
C SOD1 in UC. Conducted our audit should be extended to more group of patients in
order to assess whether or not to confirm the observed during analysis, the
protective effect of CAT-262 C / T in ulcerative colitis and other trends
observed for other polymorphic variants tested genes.

Anti-tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is used for treatment of severe cases of
inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative 
colitis (UC). However, one-third of the patients do not respond to the treatment.
A recent study indicated that genetically determined high activity of
pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6 and interferon
gamma (IFN-γ), are associated with non-response to anti-TNF therapy. Using a
candidate gene approach, 21 functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 
14 genes in the Toll-like receptors, the inflammasome and the IFNG pathways were 
assessed in 482 and 256 prior anti-TNF naïve Danish patients with CD and UC,
respectively. The results were analysed using logistic regression (adjusted for
age and gender). Eight functional SNPs were associated with anti-TNF response
either among patients with CD (TLR5 (rs5744174) and IFNGR2 (rs8126756)), UC
(IL12B (rs3212217), IL18 (rs1946518), IFNGR1 (rs2234711), TBX21 (rs17250932) and 
JAK2 (rs12343867)) or in the combined cohort of patient with CD and UC (IBD)
(NLRP3 (rs10754558), IL12B (rs3212217) and IFNGR1 (rs2234711)) (P<0.05). Only the
association with heterozygous genotype of IL12B (rs3212217) (OR: 0.24, 95% CI:
0.11-0.53, P=0.008) among patients with UC withstood Bonferroni correction for
multiple testing. In conclusion, Our results suggest that SNPs associated with
genetically determined high activity of TLR5 among patients with CD and
genetically determined high IL-12 and IL-18 levels among patients with UC were
associated with non-response. Further studies will evaluate whether these genes
may help stratifying patients according to the expected response to anti-TNF
treatment.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: There is controversy regarding the role of the type 2 immune
response in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC)-few data are available
from treatment-naive patients. We investigated whether genes associated with a
type 2 immune response in the intestinal mucosa are up-regulated in
treatment-naive pediatric patients with UC compared with patients with Crohn's
disease (CD)-associated colitis or without inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and 
whether expression levels are associated with clinical outcomes.
METHODS: We used a real-time reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction array to analyze messenger RNA (mRNA) expression patterns in rectal
mucosal samples from 138 treatment-naive pediatric patients with IBD and
macroscopic rectal disease, as well as those from 49 children without IBD
(controls), enrolled in a multicenter prospective observational study from 2008
to 2012. Results were validated in real-time reverse-transcription quantitative
polymerase chain reaction analyses of rectal RNA from an independent cohort of 34
pediatric patients with IBD and macroscopic rectal disease and 17 controls from
Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center.
RESULTS: We measured significant increases in mRNAs associated with a type 2
immune response (interleukin [IL]5 gene, IL13, and IL13RA2) and a type 17 immune 
response (IL17A and IL23) in mucosal samples from patients with UC compared with 
patients with colon-only CD. In a regression model, increased expression of IL5
and IL17A mRNAs distinguished patients with UC from patients with colon-only CD
(P = .001; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.72). We
identified a gene expression pattern in rectal tissues of patients with UC,
characterized by detection of IL13 mRNA, that predicted clinical response to
therapy after 6 months (odds ratio [OR], 6.469; 95% confidence interval [CI],
1.553-26.94), clinical response after 12 months (OR, 6.125; 95% CI, 1.330-28.22),
and remission after 12 months (OR, 5.333; 95% CI, 1.132-25.12).
CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of rectal tissues from treatment-naive pediatric
patients with IBD, we observed activation of a type 2 immune response during the 
early course of UC. We were able to distinguish patients with UC from those with 
colon-only CD based on increased mucosal expression of genes that mediate type 2 
and type 17 immune responses. Increased expression at diagnosis of genes that
mediate a type 2 immune response is associated with response to therapy and
remission in pediatric patients with UC.

Although the zebrafish was initially developed as a model system to study
embryonic development, it has gained increasing attention as an advantageous
system to investigate human diseases, including intestinal disorders. Zebrafish
embryos develop rapidly, and their digestive system is fully functional and
visible by 5days post fertilization. There is a large degree of homology between 
the intestine of zebrafish and higher vertebrate organisms in terms of its
cellular composition and function as both a digestive and immune organ.
Furthermore, molecular pathways regulating injury and immune responses are highly
conserved. In this chapter, we provide an overview of studies addressing
developmental and physiological processes relevant to human intestinal disease.
These studies include those related to congenital disorders, host-microbiota
interactions, inflammatory diseases, motility disorders, and intestinal cancer.
We also highlight the utility of zebrafish to functionally validate candidate
genes identified through mutational analyses and genome-wide association studies,
and discuss methodologies to investigate the intestinal biology that are unique
to zebrafish.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Gastrointestinal complications are very common in patients
undergoing cancer treatment. Some of these complications can be life threatening 
and require prompt and appropriate diagnosis and treatment. The purpose of this
review is to address luminal gastrointestinal and hepatic complications
associated with a new class of anticancer drugs, immune checkpoint inhibitors
(CPIs), and focuses on the identification, evaluation, and management of the
complications associated with this class of drugs.
RECENT FINDINGS: It is now recognized that immune checkpoint inhibitors are
frequently associated with luminal GI side effects such as diarrhea and
enterocolitis and hepatic complications such as hepatitis. While colitis
associated with CPIs, to some extent, mimics that found in idiopathic
inflammatory bowel disease, the complex interplay of genes, the environment, the 
immune system, and the microbiome make it difficult to fully differentiate these 
conditions clinically. CPI-induced hepatitis is most often associated with a
pattern of hepatocellular injury with panlobular hepatitis. A variety of
biomarkers have been proposed to predict an adverse response to CPIs and are
under investigation. It has been proposed that alterations in the microbiome may 
impact the risk of developing colitis, and these studies are reviewed. In
contrast to idiopathic chronic inflammatory bowel disease, CPI-induced colitis is
often reversible if rapidly treated in accordance with the immune-mediated
adverse reaction management guidelines. Treatment algorithms have been suggested 
but are, to some extent, empiric and based on algorithms for the treatment of
idiopathic inflammatory bowel disorders. CPIs may be associated with significant 
GI complications which impact their successful use in the treatment of neoplastic
diseases. Much of what we currently know about the mechanisms and treatment of
these complications is empiric and extrapolated from experience with idiopathic
inflammatory bowel disease and other immune disorders. Current research focuses
on understanding genetic predisposition and the role of the microbiome and
identifying predictive risk markers for developing complications.

BACKGROUND: A large amount of research has been devoted to the detection and
investigation of epistatic interactions in genome-wide association studies
(GWASs). Most of the literature focuses on low-order interactions between
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with significant main effects.
RESULTS: In this paper we propose an original approach for detecting epistasis at
the gene level, without systematically filtering on significant genes. We first
compute interaction variables for each gene pair by finding its Eigen-Epistasis
component, defined as the linear combination of Gene SNPs having the highest
correlation with the phenotype. The selection of significant effects is done
using a penalized regression method based on Group Lasso controlling the False
Discovery Rate.
CONCLUSION: The method is tested against two recent alternative proposals from
the literature using synthetic data, and shows good performances in different
settings. We demonstrate the power of our approach by detecting new gene-gene
interactions on three genome-wide association studies.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is assumed to be caused by genetic and
environmental factors that interact together in promoting intestinal immune
dysregulation where cytokines have validated role. However, the underlying
intimate mechanisms in the human IBD involving cytokines still needs to be
supplemented especially in the clinical context. The aim of this study was to
investigate the expression of some inflammatory and regulatory cytokines (IL-17A,
IL-23, IL-6, TGFβ1, and IL-10) as well as of the transcription factor FoxP3 in
mucosal samples of IBD and non-IBD patients. We assessed the mRNA relative
quantities (RQ) of the above-mentioned cytokines and the transcription factor
FoxP3 in paired colonic samples (inflamed and adjacent normal mucosa) from 37
patients with IBD and in normal mucosal tissue in 12 persons without IBD by
performing a qRT-PCR assay and tested the protein levels of target cytokines in
serum samples. The patients were divided into three groups: without any therapy
(n=10), on 5-ASA (n=11) and on immunosuppressants
(Azathioprine±5-ASA/corticosteroids) (n=16) in order to compare the RQ values for
each therapeutic group. All investigated genes were found upregulated in the
inflamed mucosa of IBD patients in the following order:
IL-6>FoxP3>TGFβ1>IL-23>IL-17A>IL-10. We also observed that the gene expression of
FoxP3 and IL-6 were substantially higher in the inflamed mucosal tissue of the
IBD patients than the adjacent normal mucosa (p=0.035, p=0.03 respectively).
Differences between higher mRNA expression of FoxP3 and IL-6 in inflamed tissue
were considered significant in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) (p=0.011,
p=0.000 respectively) and with Crohn's disease (CD) (p=0.008, p=0.000
respectively) in comparison to the normal mucosa of non-IBD persons and we found 
increased TGFβ1 in CD patients alone (p=0.041). Furthermore, IL-6 and TGFβ1 were 
overexpressed (RQ>10) in non-inflamed mucosa from IBD patients compared to the
normal mucosa from the controls. When we compared the gene expression for paired 
mucosa in the immunosuppressive treated group with the 5-ASA treated group we
observed opposite changes in IL-6 and TGFβ1 expression. Additionally, we found
higher serum levels of IL-23 (p=0.008), TGFβ1 and IL-6 in IBD patients compared
to non-IBD patients. The obtained specific expression profile consisting of IL-6,
TGFβ1, IL-10 and FoxP3 may represent a transcriptional hallmark for IBD.
Furthermore, we found that treatment with immunosuppressive therapy was more
beneficial for driving cytokine expression to restore immune regulation in
patients with IBD, unlike the 5-ASA therapy.

The Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation (CAGI) experiment is the first
attempt to evaluate the state-of-the-art in genetic data interpretation. Among
the proposed challenges, Crohn disease (CD) risk prediction has become the most
classic problem spanning three editions. The scientific question is very hard:
can anybody assess the risk to develop CD given the exome data alone? This is one
of the ultimate goals of genetic analysis, which motivated most CAGI participants
to look for powerful new methods. In the 2016 CD challenge, we implemented all
the best methods proposed in the past editions. This resulted in 10 algorithms,
which were evaluated fairly by CAGI organizers. We also used all the data
available from CAGI 11 and 13 to maximize the amount of training samples. The
most effective algorithms used known genes associated with CD from the
literature. No method could evaluate effectively the importance of unannotated
variants by using heuristics. As a downside, all CD datasets were strongly
affected by sample stratification. This affected the performance reported by
assessors. Therefore, we expect that future datasets will be normalized in order 
to remove population effects. This will improve methods comparison and promote
algorithms focused on causal variants discovery.

AIM: Infantile-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IO-IBD) with the onset of
disease before 12 mo of age, is a different disease entity from childhood IBD. We
aimed to describe the clinical features, outcome and role of mutation in
interleukin-10 (IL-10) and interleukin-10 receptors (IL-10R) in Asian children
with IO-IBD.
METHODS: All cases of IO-IBD, defined as onset of disease before 12 mo of age,
seen at University Malaya Medical Center, Malaysia were reviewed. We performed
mutational analysis for IL10 and IL10R genes in patients with presenting clinical
features of Crohn's disease (CD).
RESULTS: Six [13%; CD = 3, ulcerative colitis (UC) = 2, IBD-unclassified (IBD-U) 
= 1] of the 48 children (CD = 25; UC = 23) with IBD have IO-IBD. At final review 
[median (range) duration of follow-up: 6.5 (3.0-20) years], three patients were
in remission without immunosuppression [one each for post-colostomy (IBD-U),
after standard immunosuppression (CD), and after total colectomy (UC)]. Three
patients were on immunosuppression: one (UC) was in remission while two (both CD)
had persistent disease. As compared with later-onset disease, IO-IBD were more
likely to present with bloody diarrhea (100% vs 55%, P = 0.039) but were similar 
in terms of an associated autoimmune liver disease (0% vs 19%, P = 0.31),
requiring biologics therapy (50% vs 36%, P = 0.40), surgery (50% vs 29%, P =
0.27), or achieving remission (50% vs 64%, P = 0.40). No mutations in either IL10
or IL10R in the three patients with CD and the only patient with IBD-U were
identified.
CONCLUSION: The clinical features of IO-IBD in this Asian cohort of children who 
were negative for IL-10 or IL-10R mutations were variable. As compared to
childhood IBD with onset of disease after 12 mo of age, IO-IBD achieved remission
at a similar rate.

Both hidradenitis suppurativa and Crohn disease are considered chronic
inflammatory diseases due to immune dysregulation. The high prevalence of Crohn
disease patients diagnosed with hidradenitis suppurativa suggests the existence
of common pathogenic links. The present literature review analyses the
similarities and differences in the pathogenesis of the two diseases, in the
search for new research and knowledge targets.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is up-regulated in
ulcerative colitis and implicated in the pathology of the disease. In this study,
we have examined the effects of a barbiturate-based MMP inhibitor incorporating a
nitric oxide donor/mimetic group (dinitrate-barbiturate) on the intestinal injury
induced by dextran sulphate sodium (DSS).
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: In vivo experiments were carried out using male Wistar
rats given 5% DSS ad libitum in drinking water. The dinitrate-barbiturate,
non-nitrate equivalent, nitrate side chains alone or vehicle were administered
rectally, twice daily. MMP-9 release was measured by gelatin zymography, and
analysis of gene expression was carried out using RT-qPCR. TaqMan low density
arrays were used to evaluate the expression of 91 inflammatory genes in the rat
colon.
KEY RESULTS: The dinitrate-barbiturate inhibited the induction and activity of
MMP-9 during DSS colitis in the rat. This occurred in association with
significant reductions in the colitic response to DSS as assessed by an
established clinical disease activity index and a pathological colitis grade
score. The compound modified expression rates of numerous inflammation-related
genes in the colon.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This study demonstrated the efficacy of the
dinitrate-barbiturate in DSS-induced colitis. Therefore, barbiturate-nitrate
hybrids may be developed as a promising anti-inflammatory approach to the
treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.

INTRODUCTION: MicroRNAs (miRs) came recently into focus as promising novel
research targets offering new insights into the pathogenesis of inflammatory
bowel diseases (IBD).
AIMS: The aim of our study was to identify a pediatric IBD (pIBD) characteristic 
miR profile serving as potential Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)
specific diagnostic pattern and to further analyze the related target genes.
METHODS: Small RNA sequencing was performed on inflamed and intact colonic
biopsies of CD, and control patients. Selected miRs were further investigated by 
RT-PCR, complemented with an UC group, in order to address the differential
diagnostic potential of miRs in the two IBD subtypes. To analyze network
connection of differentially expressed miRs and their target genes MiRTarBase
database and previous transcriptome sequencing data from pediatric patient groups
were used.
RESULTS: Sequencing analysis identified 170 miRs with altered expression. RT-PCR 
analysis revealed altered expression of miR-31, -125a, -142-3p, and -146a
discriminating between the inflamed mucosa of CD and UC. In the intact mucosa of 
CD patients the expression of miR-18a, -20a, -21, -31, -99a, -99b, -100, -125a,
-126, -142-5p, -146a, -185, -204, -221, and -223 was elevated compared to the
controls. The expression of miR-20a, -204 and -221 was elevated exclusively in
the intact region of CD patients compared to the controls. Enrichment analysis
identified main IBD-related functional groups.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated a characteristic colonic miR pattern in pIBD that
could facilitate deeper understanding of the pathomechanism of IBD and may serve 
as a diagnostic tool.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology
and a polygenic disease. IL-27 encodes p28, a subunit of IL-12 family cytokines, 
and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of UC. The aims of the present study 
were to evaluate the genetic association of a variant of the IL-27 gene with UC
and to further characterize the functional variant in the IL-27 gene that
influences the risk for UC. Our data demonstrated that the genetic variant
rs153109 in the 5' upstream region of IL-27 is significantly associated with UC
in Chinese Han individuals. Analysis of IL-27 transcripts demonstrated that
individuals carrying the risk allele of rs153109 display reduced transcription of
IL-27 in PBMCs. Luciferase activity assays demonstrated that the risk allele
rs153109 results in decreased promoter activity compared to a non-risk allele in 
a tissue specific manner. Mechanistic characterization of histone modifications
in the promoter region revealed that the risk haplotype tagged by the risk allele
of rs153109 reduces the levels of H3K3me3 and H3K27ac.

To further resolve the genetic architecture of the inflammatory bowel diseases
ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, we sequenced the whole genomes of 4,280
patients at low coverage and compared them to 3,652 previously sequenced
population controls across 73.5 million variants. We then imputed from these
sequences into new and existing genome-wide association study cohorts and tested 
for association at ∼12 million variants in a total of 16,432 cases and 18,843
controls. We discovered a 0.6% frequency missense variant in ADCY7 that doubles
the risk of ulcerative colitis. Despite good statistical power, we did not
identify any other new low-frequency risk variants and found that such variants
explained little heritability. We detected a burden of very rare, damaging
missense variants in known Crohn's disease risk genes, suggesting that more
comprehensive sequencing studies will continue to improve understanding of the
biology of complex diseases.

Genetic association studies have identified 215 risk loci for inflammatory bowel 
disease, thereby uncovering fundamental aspects of its molecular biology. We
performed a genome-wide association study of 25,305 individuals and conducted a
meta-analysis with published summary statistics, yielding a total sample size of 
59,957 subjects. We identified 25 new susceptibility loci, 3 of which contain
integrin genes that encode proteins in pathways that have been identified as
important therapeutic targets in inflammatory bowel disease. The associated
variants are correlated with expression changes in response to immune stimulus at
two of these genes (ITGA4 and ITGB8) and at previously implicated loci (ITGAL and
ICAM1). In all four cases, the expression-increasing allele also increases
disease risk. We also identified likely causal missense variants in a gene
implicated in primary immune deficiency, PLCG2, and a negative regulator of
inflammation, SLAMF8. Our results demonstrate that new associations at common
variants continue to identify genes relevant to therapeutic target identification
and prioritization.

Zebrafish are an excellent model for the study of intestinal immunity. The
availability of several transgenic reporter fish for different innate and
adaptive immune cells and the high homology in terms of gut function and

Here, we describe a method to induce intestinal inflammation by intra-rectal
injection of the hapten oxazolone in adult zebrafish.

BACKGROUND: A vast diversity of microbes colonizes in the human gastrointestinal 
tract, referred to intestinal microbiota. Microbiota and products thereof are
indispensable for shaping the development and function of host innate immune
system, thereby exerting multifaceted impacts in gut health.
METHODS: This paper reviews the effects on immunity of gut microbe-derived
nucleic acids, and gut microbial metabolites, as well as the involvement of
commensals in the gut homeostasis. We focus on the recent findings with an
intention to illuminate the mechanisms by which the microbiota and products
thereof are interacting with host immunity, as well as to scrutinize imbalanced
gut microbiota (dysbiosis) which lead to autoimmune disorders including
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Type 1 diabetes (T1D) and systemic immune
syndromes such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
RESULTS: In addition to their well-recognized benefits in the gut such as
occupation of ecological niches and competition with pathogens, commensal
bacteria have been shown to strengthen the gut barrier and to exert
immunomodulatory actions within the gut and beyond. It has been realized that
impaired intestinal microbiota not only contribute to gut diseases but also are
inextricably linked to metabolic disorders and even brain dysfunction.
CONCLUSIONS: A better understanding of the mutual interactions of the microbiota 
and host immune system, would shed light on our endeavors of disease prevention
and broaden the path to our discovery of immune intervention targets for disease 
treatment.

Inflammation is the driving force in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and its
link to oxidative stress and carcinogenesis has long been accepted. The
antioxidant system of the intestinal mucosa in IBD is compromised resulting in
increased oxidative injury. This defective antioxidant system may be the result
of genetic variants in antioxidant genes, which can represent susceptibility
factors for IBD, namely Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the antioxidant genes SOD2 (rs4880) and GPX1
(rs1050450) were genotyped in a Portuguese population comprising 436 Crohn's
disease and 367 ulcerative colitis patients, and 434 healthy controls. We found
that the AA genotype in GPX1 is associated with ulcerative colitis (OR = 1.93,
adjusted P-value = 0.037). Moreover, we found nominal significant associations
between SOD2 and Crohn's disease susceptibility and disease subphenotypes but
these did not withstand the correction for multiple testing. These findings
indicate a possible link between disease phenotypes and antioxidant genes. These 
results suggest a potential role for antioxidant genes in IBD pathogenesis and
should be considered in future association studies.

The intestinal epithelium constitutes a physical barrier between inner and outer 
side of our body. It also functions as a "hub" which connects factors that
determine the development of inflammatory bowel disease, such as microbiota,
susceptibility genes, and host immune response. Accordingly, recent studies have 
implicated and further featured the role of intestinal epithelial cell
dysfunction in the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease. For example,
mucin producing goblet cells are usually "depleted" in ulcerative colitis
patients. Studies have shown that those goblet cells exhibit various
immune-regulatory functions in addition to mucin production, such as antigen
presentation or cytokine production. Paneth cells are another key cell lineage
that has been deeply implicated in the pathophysiology of Crohn's disease.
Several susceptibility genes for Crohn's disease may lead to impairment of
anti-bacterial peptide production and secretion by Paneth cells. Also, other
susceptibility genes may determine the survival of Paneth cells, which leads to
reduced Paneth cell function in the patient small intestinal mucosa. Further
studies may reveal other unexpected roles of the intestinal epithelium in the
pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease, and may help to develop
alternative therapies targeted to intestinal epithelial cell functions.

It remains unclear whether epithelial cell-derived cytokines, including
interleukin (IL)-25, IL-33 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), contribute to
development of canine chronic enteropathy (CE), which includes
antibiotic-responsive enteropathy (ARE), food-responsive enteropathy (FRE) and
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In the present study, we examined mRNA
expression of il-25, il-33 and tslp in the duodenal and colonic mucosae of dogs
with ARE, FRE and IBD. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that mRNA expression of
il-33 was significantly lower in the duodenum in dogs with FRE than in healthy
dogs. The results suggest that epithelial cell-derived cytokines may not be an
inducer of Th2-type immunity in the gut of dogs with CE, and decreased expression
of IL-33 may be involved in induction of FRE. Further studies are required to
clarify roles of epithelial cell-derived cytokines, especially IL-33, in the
pathogenesis of canine CE.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients are at increased risk of developing
colorectal cancer (CRC). Vitamin D (vD) induces NOD2 gene expression, enhancing
immunity, while deficiency impairs intestinal epithelial integrity, increasing
inflammation. This study investigated the effect of vD on CRC in colitis, and if 
preventive benefits are mediated via NOD2. Inflammation-associated CRC was
induced by treating C57BL/6J and Nod2-/- mice with azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran
sodium sulfate (DSS) cycles (×3). vD-deficient mice displayed more severe colitis
compared to vD-supplemented mice, with greater weight loss, higher colitis
activity index, increased colonic weight/length ratios, and lower survival rates.
Increased histological inflammation score and increased IL-6 were observed in the
mucosa of vD-deficient mice. Overall incidence of colonic tumors was not
significantly different between vD-deficient and vD-supplemented mice. Higher
tumor multiplicity was observed in vD-deficient vs vD-supplemented groups (both
mouse strains). After AOM/DSS treatment, decreased plasma 25(OH)D3 levels and
downregulation of vD target genes Cyp24 and Vdr were observed in both mice
strains (vD-deficient or vD-supplemented diet), compared to saline-treated
controls on the vD-deficient diet. In conclusion, vD supplementation reduced
colitis severity and decreased the number of inflammation-associated colorectal
tumors in both C57BL/6J and Nod2-/- mice, independent of NOD2.

Several recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified susceptibility
loci/genes for Behçet's disease (BD). However, no study has specifically
investigated the genetic susceptibility loci associated with intestinal
involvement in BD. We aimed to identify distinctive genetic susceptibility
loci/genes associated with intestinal involvement in BD and determine their roles
in intestinal inflammation as well as their interactions with genes involved in
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). GWAS and validation studies showed intestinal
BD-specific associations with an NAALADL2 gene locus (rs3914501, P = 3.8 × 10-4) 
and a YIPF7 gene locus (rs6838327, P = 3.5 × 10-4). Validation, haplotype, and
pathway analyses showed distinct genetic architectures between intestinal BD and 
BD without intestinal involvement. Furthermore, network analysis revealed shared 
pathogenic pathways between intestinal BD and IBD. Gene functional analyses
indicated that down-regulation of NAALADL2 and YIPF7 expression was associated
with exacerbating intestinal inflammatory responses both in vitro and in vivo.
Our results provide new insights into intestinal BD-specific genetic variations, 
which represents a distinct pathway from BD without intestinal involvement.
Functional consequences of the intestinal BD-specific NAALADL2 and YIPF7
expression patterns proved a suggestive association with intestinal inflammation 
risk, which warrants further validation.

Current treatment for pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients is
often ineffective, with serious side effects. Manipulating the gut microbiota via
fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an emerging treatment approach but
remains controversial. We aimed to assess the composition of the fecal microbiome
through a comparison of pediatric IBD patients to their healthy siblings,
evaluating risks and prospects for FMT in this setting. A case-control (sibling) 
study was conducted analyzing fecal samples of six children with Crohn's disease 
(CD), six children with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 12 healthy siblings by
metagenomic sequencing. In addition, lifetime antibiotic intake was
retrospectively determined. Species richness and diversity were significantly
reduced in UC patients compared with control [Mann-Whitney U-test false discovery
rate (MWU FDR) = 0.011]. In UC, bacteria positively influencing gut homeostasis, 
e.g., Eubacterium rectale and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, were significantly
reduced in abundance (MWU FDR = 0.05). Known pathobionts like Escherichia coli
were enriched in UC patients (MWU FDR = 0.084). Moreover, E. coli abundance
correlated positively with that of several virulence genes (SCC > 0.65, FDR <
0.1). A shift toward antibiotic-resistant taxa in both IBD groups distinguished
them from controls [MWU Benjamini-Hochberg-Yekutieli procedure (BY) FDR = 0.062
in UC, MWU BY FDR = 0.019 in CD). The collected results confirm a microbial
dysbiosis in pediatric UC, and to a lesser extent in CD patients, replicating
associations found previously using different methods. Taken together, these
observations suggest microbiotal remodeling therapy from family donors, at least 
for children with UC, as a viable option.NEW & NOTEWORTHY In this sibling study, 
prior reports of microbial dysbiosis in IBD patients from 16S rRNA sequencing was
verified using deep shotgun sequencing and augmented with insights into the
abundance of bacterial virulence genes and bacterial antibiotic resistance
determinants, seen against the background of data on the specific antibiotic
intake of each of the study participants. The observed dysbiosis, which
distinguishes patients from siblings, highlights such siblings as potential
donors for microbiotal remodeling therapy in IBD.

AIM: Multiple cytokines and chemokines related to immune response, apoptosis and 
inflammation have been identified as molecules implicated in ulcerative colitis
(UC) pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to identify the differences at gene 
expression level of a panel of candidate genes in mucosa from patients with
active UC (UCA), patients in remission (UCR), and normal controls.
PATIENTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven individuals were enrolled in the study:
eight UC patients (four with active lesions, four with mucosal healing) and three
controls without inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) seen on endoscopy. All the
individuals underwent mucosal biopsy during colonoscopy. Gene expression profile 
was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array, investigating 84 genes
implicated in apoptosis, inflammation, immune response, cellular adhesion, tissue
remodeling and mucous secretion.
RESULTS: Seventeen and three genes out of 84 were found significantly
differentially expressed in UCA and UCR compared to controls, respectively. In
particular, REG1A and CHI3L1 genes reported an up-regulation in UCA with a fold
difference above 200. In UCR patients, the levels of CASP1, LYZ and ISG15 were
different compared to controls. However, since a significant up-regulation of
both CASP1 and LYZ was observed also in the UCA group, only ISG15 levels remained
associated to the remission state.
CONCLUSIONS: ISG15, that plays a key role in the innate immune response, seemed
to be specifically associated to the UC remission state. These preliminary data
represent a starting point for defining the gene profile of UC in different
stages in Romanian population. Identification of genes implicated in UC
pathogenesis could be useful to select new therapeutic targets.

AIM: A series of mechanisms of immune response, inflammation and apoptosis have
been demonstrated to contribute to the appearance and evolution of Crohn's
disease (CD) through the overexpression of several cytokines and chemokines in a 
susceptible host. The aim of this study was to identify the differences in gene
expression profiles analyzing a panel of candidate genes in the mucosa from
patients with active CD (CD-A), patients in remission (CD-R), and normal
controls.
PATIENTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine individuals were enrolled in the study: six
CD patients (three with active lesions, three with mucosal healing) and three
controls without inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) seen on endoscopy. All the
individuals underwent mucosal biopsy during colonoscopy. Gene expression levels
of 84 genes previously associated with CD were evaluated by polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) array.
RESULTS: Ten genes out of 84 were found significantly differentially expressed in
CD-A (CCL11, CCL25, DEFA5, GCG, IL17A, LCN2, REG1A, STAT3, MUC1, CCR1) and eight 
genes in CD-R (CASP1, IL23A, STAT1, STAT3, TNF, CCR1, CCL5, and HSP90B1) when
compared to controls. A quantitative gene expression analysis revealed that CCR1 
gene was more expressed in CD-A than in CD-R.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that CCR1 gene may be a putative marker of
molecular activity of Crohn's disease. Following these preliminary data, a
confirmation in larger cohort studies could represent a useful method in order to
identify new therapeutic targets.

The incidence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) has steadily increased in
recent decades-a phenomenon that cannot be explained by genetic mutations alone. 
Other factors, including the composition of the intestinal microbiome, are
potentially important contributors to the increased occurrence of this group of
diseases. Previous reports have shown a correlation between early-life antibiotic
(Abx) treatment and an increased incidence of IBD. In this report, we
investigated the effects of early-life Abx treatments on the pathogenicity of
CD4+ T cells using an experimental T cell transfer model of IBD. Our results show
that CD4+ T cells isolated from adult mice that had been treated with Abx during 
gestation and in early life induced a faster onset of IBD in Rag1-deficient mice 
compared with CD4+ T cells of untreated mice. Ex vivo functional analyses of
IBD-inducing CD4+ T cells did not show significant differences in their
immunologic potential ex vivo, despite their in vivo phenotype. However,
genome-wide gene-expression analysis revealed that these cells displayed
dysregulated expression of genes associated with cell-cycle regulation,
metabolism, and cellular stress. Analysis of Abx-treated CD4+ T cell donors
showed systemically elevated levels of the stress hormone corticosterone
throughout life compared with untreated donors. The cohousing of Abx-treated mice
with untreated mice decreased serum corticosterone, and a consequent transfer of 
the cells from cohoused mice into Rag1-deficient mice restored the onset and
severity of disease to that of untreated animals. Thus, our results suggest that 
early-life Abx treatment results in a stress response with high levels of
corticosterone that influences CD4+ T cell function.

It is known that ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
shared a common genetic component. The gist of current study is to assess the
role of IBD-associated autophagy gene IRGM on AS susceptibility in a Chinese Han 
population. A total of 1270 unrelated subjects (643 AS and 627 controls) were
enrolled. Two tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs10065172 and
rs4958846) were selected and were genotyped by iMLDR Assay technology. Genotypes 
and haplotype analysis were conducted by using SPSS 16.0 and haploview 4.2
software. Among two tag SNPs of IRGM, no correlation was observed between
rs10065172 and AS susceptibility. For rs4958846, genotype and allelic frequencies
were marginally discrepant between female cases and controls before, not after,
Bonferroni correction (P=0.049; P=0.031). Logistic regression analysis revealed
that carriers with CT+TT or CT genotype had a significantly decreased risk for
developing AS among female subjects when compared with CC genotype (OR=0.514, 95%
CI=0.301-0.876, P=0.014; OR=0.518, 95% CI=0.297-0.902, P=0.020, respectively).
Additionally, a risk haplotype rs4958846C-rs10065172C (OR=2.093, 95%
CI=1.301-3.368) and a protective haplotype rs4958846T-rs10065172C (OR=0.652, 95% 
CI=0.441-0.964) were also identified to be associated with female AS.
IBD-associated IRGM gene is also associated with AS susceptibility in the Chinese
female population, indicating that autophagy pathway may involve in AS genetic
predisposition.

Vitamin D has emerged as a key regulator of innate immune responses to pathogen
threat. The hormonal form of vitamin D signals through a nuclear receptor
transcription factor and regulates gene transcription. Several papers have shown 
that vitamin D signaling is active both upstream and downstream of pattern
recognition receptors, vanguards of innate immune responses. Crohn's disease (CD)
is a relapsing-recurring inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that arises from
dysregulated intestinal innate immunity. Indeed, genetic studies have identified 
several CD susceptibility markers linked to mechanisms of innate immune responses
to infection. Interest in links between vitamin D deficiency and CD has grown
substantially, particularly in the last five years. While a number of studies
have consistently revealed an association between CD and vitamin D deficiency,
recent experimental work has uncovered a compelling mechanistic basis for the
contribution of vitamin D deficiency to the pathogenesis of the disease.
Moreover, a number of intervention trials have provided generally solid evidence 
that robust vitamin D supplementation may be of therapeutic benefit to patients
with CD. This review summarizes these laboratory and clinical findings.

The suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokine-induced inflammation responses is an
attractive pharmacological target for the development of therapeutic strategies
for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In the present study, we evaluated the
anti-inflammatory properties of flavonoid isoliquiritigenin (ISL) in intestinal
epithelial cells and determined its mechanism of action. ISL suppressed the
expression of inflammatory molecules, including IL-8, IL-1β and COX-2, in
TNF-α-stimulated HT-29 cells. Moreover, ISL induced activation of Nrf2 and
expression of its target genes, such as HO-1 and NQO1. ISL also inhibited the
TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation in HT-29 cells. High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1),
which is one of the critical mediators of inflammation, is actively secreted from
inflammatory cytokine-stimulated immune or non-immune cells. ISL inhibited HMGB1 
secretion by preventing TNF-α-stimulated HMGB1 relocation, whereas the RNA and
protein expression levels of cellular HMGB1 did not change in response to TNF-α
or ISL. Moreover, we found that HMGB1 acetylation was associated with HMGB1
translocation to the cytoplasm and the extracellular release in TNF-α-stimulated 
HT-29 cells; however, ISL significantly decreased the amount of acetylated HMGB1 
in both the cytoplasm and extracellular space of HT-29 cells. Histone deacetylase
(HDAC) inhibition by Scriptaid abrogated ISL-induced HDAC activity and reversed
the ISL-mediated decrease in acetylated HMGB1 release in TNF-α-stimulated HT-29
cells, suggesting that, at least in TNF-α-stimulated HT-29 cells, ISL suppresses 
acetylated HMGB1 release via the induction of HDAC activity. Together, the
current results suggest that inhibition of HMGB1 release via the induction of
HDAC activity using ISL may be a promising therapeutic intervention for IBD.

Most inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are classic complex disorders represented
by common alleles. Here we aimed to define the genetic architecture of pediatric 
and adult-onset IBDs for the Polish population. A total of 1495 patients were
recruited, including 761 patients with Crohn's disease (CD; 424 pediatric), 734
patients with ulcerative colitis (UC; 390 pediatric), and 934 healthy controls.
Allelotyping employed a pooled-DNA genome-wide association study (GWAS) and was
validated by individual genotyping. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on
44 IBD patients diagnosed before 6 years of age, 45 patients diagnosed after 40
years of age, and 18 healthy controls. Altogether, out of 88 selected SNPs, 31
SNPs were replicated for association with IBD. A novel BRD2 (rs1049526)
association reached significance of P = 5.2 × 10-11 and odds ratio (OR) = 2.43.
Twenty SNPs were shared between pediatric and adult patients; 1 and 7 were unique
to adult-onset and pediatric-onset IBD, respectively. WES identified numerous
rare and potentially deleterious variants in IBD-associated or innate
immunity-associated genes. Deleterious alleles in both groups were
over-represented among rare variants in affected children. Our GWAS revealed
differences in the polygenic architecture of pediatric- and adult-onset IBD. A
significant accumulation of rare and deleterious variants in affected children
suggests a contribution by yet unexplained genetic components.

BACKGROUND: Recent animal studies have identified that dietary salt intake may
modify the risk and progression of autoimmune disorders through modulation of the
IL-23/TH17 pathway, which is critical in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis
(UC) and Crohn's disease (CD).
METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of U.S. women enrolled in the Nurses'
Health Study (NHS) and NHSII who provided detailed and validated information on
diet and lifestyle beginning in 1984 in NHS and 1991 in NHSII. We confirmed
incident cases of UC and CD reported through 2010 in NHS and 2011 in NHSII. We
used Cox proportional hazards models to calculate hazard ratios and 95%
confidence intervals. In a case-control study nested within these cohorts, we
evaluated the interaction between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes
involved in TH17 pathway and dietary potassium on risk of CD and UC. In a cohort 
of healthy volunteers, we also assessed the effect of supplemental potassium on
development of naïve and memory T cells, differentiated with TGFβ1 or TH17
conditions.
RESULTS: Among a total of 194,711 women over a follow-up of 3,220,247
person-years, we documented 273 cases of CD and 335 cases of UC. Dietary intake
of potassium (Ptrend = 0.005) but not sodium (Ptrend = 0.44) was inversely
associated with risk of CD. Although, both dietary potassium and sodium were not 
significantly associated with risk of UC, there was a suggestion of an inverse
association with dietary potassium (Ptrend = 0.08). The association of potassium 
with risk of CD and UC appeared to be modified by loci involved in the TH17
pathway that have previously been associated with susceptibility to CD,
particularly SNP rs7657746 (IL21) (Pinteraction = 0.004 and 0.01, respectively). 
In vitro, potassium enhanced the expression of Foxp3 in both naïve and memory
CD4+ T cells via activating Smad2/3 and inhibiting Smad7 in TH17 cells.
CONCLUSION: Dietary potassium is inversely associated with risk of CD with both
in vitro and gene-environment interaction data suggesting a potential role for
potassium in regulating immune tolerance through its effect on Tregs and TH17
pathway.

BACKGROUND: Whether aminosalicylates or thiopurines reduce the risk of colorectal
cancer (CRC) in inflammatory bowel (IBD) disease is controversial.
AIM: To assess simultaneously the chemopreventive effect of aminosalicylates or
thiopurines in a case-control study nested in the CESAME observational cohort
that enrolled consecutive patients with IBD between May 2004 and June 2005.
Patients were followed up to December 2007.
METHODS: Study population comprised 144 case patients who developed CRC from the 
diagnosis of IBD (65 and 79 cases diagnosed, respectively, before and from 2004, 
starting year of the prospective observational period of CESAME) and 286 controls
matched for gender, age, IBD subtype and year of diagnosis, and cumulative extent
of colitis. Exposure to aminosalicylates or thiopurines was defined by an
exposure to the treatment during the year of the diagnosis of cancer. The
propensity of receiving 5-ASA and thiopurines was quantified by a composite score
taking into account patient and IBD characteristics. The role of aminosalicylates
or thiopurines was assessed by multivariate analysis. Propensity scores and the
history of primary sclerosing cholangitis were entered into the multivariate
model for adjustment.
RESULTS: By multivariate analysis adjusted for propensity, a significant
protective effect of exposure to drugs during the year of cancer was found for
aminosalicylates (OR = 0.587, 95% CI: 0.367-0.937, P = 0.0257), but not for
thiopurines (OR = 0.762, 95% CI: 0.432-1.343, P = 0.3468).
CONCLUSION: In a case-control study nested in the CESAME cohort, a significant
decrease in the risk of colorectal cancer in IBD was associated with exposure to 
aminosalicylates, not to thiopurines.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare progressive disorder leading to
bile duct destruction; ∼75% of patients have comorbid inflammatory bowel disease 
(IBD). We undertook the largest genome-wide association study of PSC (4,796 cases
and 19,955 population controls) and identified four new genome-wide significant
loci. The most associated SNP at one locus affects splicing and expression of
UBASH3A, with the protective allele (C) predicted to cause nonstop-mediated mRNA 
decay and lower expression of UBASH3A. Further analyses based on common variants 
suggested that the genome-wide genetic correlation (rG) between PSC and
ulcerative colitis (UC) (rG = 0.29) was significantly greater than that between
PSC and Crohn's disease (CD) (rG = 0.04) (P = 2.55 × 10-15). UC and CD were
genetically more similar to each other (rG = 0.56) than either was to PSC (P <
1.0 × 10-15). Our study represents a substantial advance in understanding of the 
genetics of PSC.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of rs6983267 polymorphism with risk of 
sporadic colorectal cancer; to compare the distribution of rs6983267 polymorphism
between ulcerative colitis and general population.
METHODS: 186 patients with sporadic colorectal cancer, 129 patients with
ulcerative colitis and 189 healthy donors were recruited in the case-control
study. Peripheral venous blood was obtained, and genomic DNA was extracted. All
samples were genotyped using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization
time-of-flight mass spectrometry techniques. Allelic and genotypic frequencies
were compared and adjusted for age and gender using unconditional Logistic
regression.
RESULTS: The allelic frequency of G and the genotypic frequencies of GG and GT
were predominant in colorectal cancer group compared with control group, which
were statistically significant after adjustment for age and gender (P<0.001). The
allelic frequency of G and the genotypic frequencies of GG and GT were
predominant in ulcerative colitis group compared with control group, which were
statistically significant as well (P=0.041, P=0.006 and P<0.001).
CONCLUSION: rs6983267 polymorphism was associated with risk of sporadic
colorectal cancer. The distribution of rs6983267 may be different between
ulcerative colitis and general population, and the frequency of risk allele G may
be higher in ulcerative colitis patients compared with general population.

Huangqin-tang (HQT) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula widely used
for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease in China. However, the molecular 
mechanisms by which HQT protects the colon are unclear. We studied the protective
effects of HQT and the underlying mechanisms in an experimental mouse model and
in vitro. In vivo, dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)-induced acute and chronic
colitis were significantly ameliorated by HQT as gauged by phenotypic,
histopathologic and inflammatory manifestations of the disease. Mechanistically, 
DSS-induced nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signalling was inhibited by HQT. Moreover, 
HQT-treated mice demonstrated significant changes in cell apoptosis, expression
of apoptosis-associated genes such as caspase-3, bax, bcl-2, and intestinal
permeability. HQT also increased occluding and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1),
inhibited cell proliferation (Ki67), and increased regulatory T cells numbers,
protein expression of Foxp3 and IL-10 in the colonic tissue. In vitro, HQT
down-regulated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and supressed the NF-κB
signalling pathway in lipopolysaccharides-induced RAW 264.7 macrophages. Our
study suggests that HQT plays a critical role in regulating intestinal epithelial
cell homeostasis, inflammation and immune response in colitis and offers novel
therapeutic options in the management of inflammatory bowel disease.

Significant insights into disease pathogenesis have been gleaned from
population-level genetic studies; however, many loci associated with complex
genetic disease contain numerous genes, and phenotypic associations cannot be
assigned unequivocally. In particular, a gene-dense locus on chromosome 11
(61.5-61.65 Mb) has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid
arthritis, and coronary artery disease. Here, we identify TMEM258 within this
locus as a central regulator of intestinal inflammation. Strikingly, Tmem258
haploinsufficient mice exhibit severe intestinal inflammation in a model of
colitis. At the mechanistic level, we demonstrate that TMEM258 is a required
component of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex and is essential for N-linked 
protein glycosylation. Consequently, homozygous deficiency of Tmem258 in colonic 
organoids results in unresolved endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress culminating in 
apoptosis. Collectively, our results demonstrate that TMEM258 is a central
mediator of ER quality control and intestinal homeostasis.

BACKGROUND: Genetic variation in the Laccase (multicopper oxidoreductase)
domain-containing 1 (LACC1) gene has been shown to affect the risk of Crohn's
disease, leprosy and, more recently, ulcerative colitis and juvenile idiopathic
arthritis. LACC1 function appears to promote fatty-acid oxidation, with
concomitant inflammasome activation, reactive oxygen species production, and
anti-bacterial responses in macrophages. We sought to contribute to elucidating
LACC1 biological function by extensive characterization of its expression in
human tissues and cells, and through preliminary analyses of the regulatory
mechanisms driving such expression.
METHODS: We implemented Western blot, quantitative real-time PCR,
immunofluorescence microscopy, and flow cytometry analyses to investigate fatty
acid metabolism-immune nexus (FAMIN; the LACC1 encoded protein) expression in
subcellular compartments, cell lines and relevant human tissues. Gene-set
enrichment analyses were performed to initially investigate modulatory mechanisms
of LACC1 expression. A small-interference RNA knockdown in vitro model system was
used to study the effect of FAMIN depletion on peroxisome function.
RESULTS: FAMIN expression was detected in macrophage-differentiated THP-1 cells
and several human tissues, being highest in neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages,
myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells among peripheral blood cells.
Subcellular co-localization was exclusively confined to peroxisomes, with some
additional positivity for organelle endomembrane structures. LACC1 co-expression 
signatures were enriched for genes involved in peroxisome proliferator-activated 
receptors (PPAR) signaling pathways, and PPAR ligands downregulated FAMIN
expression in in vitro model systems.
CONCLUSION: FAMIN is a peroxisome-associated protein with primary role(s) in
macrophages and other immune cells, where its metabolic functions may be
modulated by PPAR signaling events. However, the precise molecular mechanisms
through which FAMIN exerts its biological effects in immune cells remain to be
elucidated.

Geographic patterns with diminishing rates from north to south toward the equator
have been described for a number of diseases, putatively related largely to
"western" lifestyle. Among these the inflammatory bowel diseases; Crohn's (CD)
and Ulcerative colitis (UC) have been prominent in sharing distributions with a
number of autoimmune diseases. One of the interesting associations is the
epidemiologic similarity with multiple sclerosis (MS). However, in addition, at
least some of these diseases also correlated inversely with lactase non
persistent population (LNP) distributions. It is hypothesized that MS should also
have an inverse relationship with LNP. We provide support for this by comparing
published MS, CD, UC and LNP national rates to the beginning of the new
millennium. Possible links among these diseases may be an evolutionary signature 
of new genes which may have accompanied emergence of lactase persistence
millennia ago. The emergent phenotypic dichotomy also forced different
assimilation responses to lactose digestion. While intestinal retention of
lactase results in direct host enzymatic digestion, in LNP persons intestinal
bacterial metabolism of lactose impacts on the host micro-flora. These microbial 
changes may play some role in altering rates of diseases including IBD and MS.
However, since the late 20th century previously observed patterns are changing.
Although industrialization is considered to play an important modifying role, the
rising rates of obesity with an emphasis on diet, and microfloral pathogenesis,
but with an independent geographic pattern may also facilitate altering rates and
geographic distributions of both of these and other diseases.

Several Butyrophilin (BTN) and Btn-like (BTNL) molecules control T lymphocyte
responses, and are genetically associated with inflammatory disorders and cancer.
In this study, we present a comprehensive expression analysis of human and murine
BTN and BTNL genes in conditions associated with intestinal inflammation and
cancer. Using real-time PCR, expression of human BTN and BTNL genes was analyzed 
in samples from patients with ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, and
colon tumors. Expression of murine Btn and Btnl genes was examined in mouse
models of spontaneous colitis (Muc2-/-) and intestinal tumorigenesis (ApcMin/+). 
Our analysis indicates a strong association of several of the human genes with
ulcerative colitis and colon cancer; while especially BTN1A1, BTN2A2, BTN3A3, and
BTNL8 were significantly altered in inflammation, colonic tumors exhibited
significantly decreased levels of BTNL2, BTNL3, BTNL8, and BTNL9 as compared to
unaffected tissue. Colonic inflammation in Muc2-/- mice significantly
down-regulated the expression of particularly Btnl1, Btnl4, and Btnl6 mRNA, and
intestinal polyps derived from ApcMin/+ mice displayed altered levels of Btn1a1, 
Btn2a2, and Btnl1 transcripts. Thus, our data present an association of BTN and
BTNL genes with intestinal inflammation and cancer and represent a valuable
resource for further studies of this gene family.

BACKGROUND: Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare skin disease characterized
clinically by ulcers with undermined borders, and histologically by
neutrophil-rich infiltrates. PG may occur alone, in syndromic forms or associated
with systemic diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease and haematological or 
rheumatological disorders.
OBJECTIVES: To determine a specific genetic background related to
autoinflammation for PG.
METHODS: We assessed autoinflammation by evaluating the cytokine profile and
genes involved in classic autoinflammatory diseases in 13 patients with PG and in
seven patients with the syndromic form, known as PASH (pyoderma gangrenosum, acne
and suppurative hidradenitis).
RESULTS: In skin samples, the expression of interleukin (IL)-1β and its
receptors, IL-17 and its receptor, and tumour necrosis factor-α and its receptors
were significantly higher in both PG (P = 0·001) and in PASH (P < 0·001) than in 
controls. The chemokines IL-8; chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1/2/3; chemokine
(C-X-C motif) ligand 16; and RANTES (regulated on activation, normal
T-cell-expressed and secreted) were also overexpressed. Cases of PG and PASH
showed mutations in the autoinflammatory genes MEFV, NLRP3, NLRP12, NOD2, LPIN2
and PSTPIP1.
CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of cytokines/chemokines, along with genetic changes, 
supports the hypothesis that PG and its syndromic form, PASH, are a spectrum of
polygenic autoinflammatory conditions.

GPR4 is a proton-sensing G protein-coupled receptor that can be activated by
extracellular acidosis. It has recently been demonstrated that activation of GPR4
by acidosis increases the expression of numerous inflammatory and stress response
genes in vascular endothelial cells (ECs) and also augments EC-leukocyte
adhesion. Inhibition of GPR4 by siRNA or small molecule inhibitors reduces
endothelial cell inflammation. As acidotic tissue microenvironments exist in many
types of inflammatory disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we
examined the role of GPR4 in intestinal inflammation using a dextran sulfate
sodium (DSS)-induced acute colitis mouse model. We observed that GPR4 mRNA
expression was increased in mouse and human IBD tissues when compared to control 
intestinal tissues. To determine the function of GPR4 in intestinal inflammation,
wild-type and GPR4-deficient mice were treated with 3% DSS for 7days to induce
acute colitis. Our results showed that the severity of colitis was decreased in
GPR4-deficient DSS-treated mice in comparison to wild-type DSS-treated mice.
Clinical parameters, macroscopic disease indicators, and histopathological
features were less severe in the DSS-treated GPR4-deficient mice than the
DSS-treated wild-type mice. Endothelial adhesion molecule expression, leukocyte
infiltration, and isolated lymphoid follicle (ILF) formation were reduced in
intestinal tissues of DSS-treated GPR4-null mice. Collectively, our results
suggest GPR4 provides a pro-inflammatory role in the inflamed gut as the absence 
of GPR4 ameliorates intestinal inflammation in the acute experimental colitis
mouse model.

It has been hypothesized that apically expressed L-type Ca2+ channel Cav1.3
(encoded by CACNA1D gene) contributes toward an alternative TRPV6-independent
route of intestinal epithelial Ca2+ absorption, especially during digestion when 
high luminal concentration of Ca2+ and other nutrients limit TRPV6 contribution. 
We and others have implicated altered expression and activity of key mediators of
intestinal and renal Ca2+ (re)absorption as contributors to negative systemic
Ca2+ balance and bone loss in intestinal inflammation. Here, we investigated the 
effects of experimental colitis and related inflammatory mediators on colonic
Cav1.3 expression. We confirmed Cav1.3 expression within the segments of the
mouse and human gastrointestinal tract. Consistent with available microarray data
(GEO database) from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, mouse colonic
expression of Cav1.3 was significantly reduced in trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid
(TNBS) colitis. In vitro, IFNγ most potently reduced Cav1.3 expression. We
reproduced these findings in vivo with wild-type and Stat1-/- mice injected with 
IFNγ. The observed effect in Stat1-/- suggested a noncanonical transcriptional
repression or a posttranscriptional mechanism. In support of the latter, we
observed no effect on the cloned Cav1.3 gene promoter activity and accelerated
Cav1.3 mRNA decay rate in IFNγ-treated HCT116 cells. While the relative
contribution of Cav1.3 to intestinal Ca2+ absorption and its value as a
therapeutic target remain to be established, we postulate that Cav1.3
downregulation in IBD may contribute to the negative systemic Ca2+ balance, to
increased bone resorption, and to reduced bone mineral density in IBD patients.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Recent GWAS and meta-analyses have revealed about 200
susceptibility genes/loci for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). However, only a 
small number of studies were performed in early-onset IBD. The aim of this study 
was to assess the association between NOD2, IL23R, ATG16L1, IRGM, IL10, NKX2-3
and ORMDL3 variants and early-onset IBD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 76 affected individuals (30 with Crohn's
disease [CD] and 46 with ulcerative colitis [UC]) at the age of ≤17 years and 158
matched controls recruited in Lithuania were genotyped for the known genetic
susceptibility variants in NOD2 (Arg702Trp (rs2066844), Gly908Arg (rs2066845) and
Leu1007insC (rs2066847)), IL23R (rs11209026), ATG16L1 (rs2241880), IRGM
(rs4958847), IL10 (rs3024505), NKX2-3 (rs11190140) and ORMDL3 (rs2872507) genes.
RESULTS: Variants in NOD2 (Leu1007insC) and IRGM genes increased risk for CD
(OR=6.56, 95% CI: 2.54-16.91, P=1.21×10-5 and OR=2.32, 95% CI: 1.05-5.14,
P=0.033; respectively); whereas a variant in ORMDL3 gene was strongly associated 
with UC (OR=1.99, 95% CI: 1.23-3.20, P=4.15×10-3).
CONCLUSIONS: The results confirmed that polymorphisms in NOD2 (Leu1007insC) and
IRGM genes are associated with increased risk of CD; whereas the ORMDL3 variant
is associated with susceptibility to UC in the Lithuanian early-onset IBD
population.

INTRODUCTION: Aberrant DNA methylation frequently occurs in the inflammatory
mucosa in ulcerative colitis (UC) and is involved in UC-related tumorigenesis. We
performed comprehensive DNA methylation profiling of the promoter regions of the 
inflamed rectal mucosae of patients with UC.
DESIGN: The methylation status of the promoter CpG islands (CGIs) of 45
cancer/inflammation or age-related candidate genes and the LINE1 repetitive
element were examined in the colonic mucosae of 84 cancer-free patients with UC
by bisulfite pyrosequencing. Methylation status of selected genes (DPYS, N33,
MIR1247, GSTP1, and SOX11) was also determined in 14 neoplastic lesions (5 with
high-grade dysplasia and 9 with carcinoma) and 8 adjacent tissues derived from 12
patients. An Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array was used to characterize
the methylation status of >450,000 CpG sites for 10 patients with UC.
RESULTS: Clustering analysis based on the methylation status of the candidate
genes clearly distinguished the inflammatory samples from the noninflammatory
samples. The hypermethylation of the promoter CGIs strongly correlated with
increased disease duration, which is a known risk factor for the development of
colon cancer. Genome-wide methylation analyses revealed a high rate of
hypermethylation in the severe phenotype of UC, particularly at the CGIs.
Exclusively hypermethylated promoter CGIs in the severe phenotypes were
significantly related to genes involved in biosynthetic processes, the regulation
of metabolic processes, and nitrogen compound metabolic processes.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest the potential utility of DNA methylation as a
molecular marker and therapeutic target for UC-related tumorigenesis.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) results from aberrant immune stimulation against
a dysbiotic mucosal but relatively preserved luminal microbiota and
preferentially affects males in early onset disease. However, factors
contributing to sex-specific risk and the pattern of dysbiosis are largely
unexplored. Core 1 β3GalT-specific molecular chaperone (Cosmc), which encodes an 
X-linked chaperone important for glycocalyx formation, was recently identified as
an IBD risk factor by genome-wide association study. We deleted Cosmc in mouse
intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and found marked reduction of microbiota
diversity in progression from the proximal to the distal gut mucosa, but not in
the overlying lumen, as seen in IBD. This loss of diversity coincided with local 
emergence of a proinflammatory pathobiont and distal gut restricted pathology.
Mechanistically, we found that Cosmc regulates host genes, bacterial ligands, and
nutrient availability to control microbiota biogeography. Loss of one Cosmc
allele in males (IEC-Cosmc-/y) resulted in a compromised mucus layer, spontaneous
microbe-dependent inflammation, and enhanced experimental colitis; however,
females with loss of one allele and mosaic deletion of Cosmc in 50% of crypts
(IEC-Cosmc+/-) were protected from spontaneous inflammation and partially
protected from experimental colitis, likely due to lateral migration of normal
mucin glycocalyx from WT cells over KO crypts. These studies functionally
validate Cosmc as an IBD risk factor and implicate it in regulating the spatial
pattern of dysbiosis and sex bias in IBD.

Several lines of evidence suggest that adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) 
strains play an important role in Crohn's disease (CD). The objective of this
study was to investigate the pathogenic role of two AIEC strains, LF82 and
O83:H1, in CD patients. Organ cultures of colonic biopsies from patients were set
up to assess the effects of LF82 and O83:H1 on the expression of CEACAM6, LAMP1, 
HLA-DR, ICAM1 by immunohistochemistry and of IL-8, IFNʏ, and TNF-α genes by
RT-PCR. Moreover, on Caco2 cells, we analyzed the cell cycle, the expression of
MGMT and DNMT1 genes, and DNA damage induced by LF82 and O83:H1, by FACS, RT-PCR,
and DAPI staining, respectively. Epithelial and lamina propria mononuclear cells 
(LPMNC) expression of CEACAM6 and LAMP1 were higher in biopsies cultured in the
presence of both O83:H1 and LF82 than in biopsies cultured with non-pathogenic E.
coli. Both AIEC strains induced increased expression of ICAM-1 on blood vessels
and HLA-DR on LPMNC. We observed higher levels of TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-8
transcripts in biopsies cultured with both AIEC strains than in those cultured
with NP. Both LF82 and O83:H1, block the cell cycle into S phase, inducing DNA
damage, and modulate the expression of DNMT1 and MGMT genes. Our data suggest
that LF82 and 083:H1 strains of E. coli are able to increase in CD colonic
biopsies the expression of all the pro-inflammatory cytokines and all the mucosal
immune markers investigated. J. Cell. Physiol. 232: 2860-2868, 2017. © 2016 Wiley

Melatonin is produced in the pineal gland as well as many other organs, including
the enterochromaffin cells of the digestive mucosa. Melatonin is a powerful
antioxidant that resists oxidative stress due to its capacity to directly
scavenge reactive species, to modulate the antioxidant defense system by
increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes, and to stimulate the innate
immune response through its direct and indirect actions. In addition, the
dysregulation of the circadian system is observed to be related with alterations 
in colonic motility and cell disruptions due to the modifications of clock genes 
expression. In the gastrointestinal tract, the activities of melatonin are
mediated by melatonin receptors (MT2), serotonin (5-HT), and cholecystokinin B
(CCK2) receptors and via receptor-independent processes. The levels of melatonin 
in the gastrointestinal tract exceed by 10-100 times the blood concentrations.
Also, there is an estimated 400 times more melatonin in the gut than in the
pineal gland. Gut melatonin secretion is suggested to be influenced by the food
intake. Low dose melatonin treatment accelerates intestinal transit time whereas 
high doses may decrease gut motility. Melatonin has been studied as a co-adjuvant
treatment in several gastrointestinal diseases including irritable bowel syndrome
(IBS), constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C), diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D),
Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and necrotizing enterocolitis. The purpose
of this review is to provide information regarding the potential benefits of
melatonin as a co-adjuvant treatment in gastrointestinal diseases, especially
IBS, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and necrotizing enterocolitis.

The active vitamin D metabolite 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) has
important regulatory actions in the gut through endocrine and probably also
intracrine, autocrine and paracrine mechanisms. By activating the vitamin D
receptor (VDR), which is expressed at a high level in the small intestine and
colon, 1,25(OH)2D3 regulates numerous genes that control gut physiology and
homeostasis. 1,25(OH)2D3 is a major responsible for epithelial barrier function
and calcium and phosphate absorption, and the host's defense against pathogens
and the inflammatory response by several types of secretory and immune cells.
Moreover, recent data suggest that 1,25(OH)2D3 has a regulatory effect on the gut
microbiota and stromal fibroblasts. Many studies have linked vitamin D deficiency
to inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) and to an
increased risk of colorectal cancer, and the possible use of VDR agonists to
prevent or treat these diseases is receiving increasing interest.

Genome technologies have defined a complex genetic architecture in major
infectious, inflammatory, and autoimmune disorders. High density marker arrays
and Immunochips have powered genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that have
mapped nearly 450 genetic risk loci in 22 major inflammatory diseases, including 
a core of common genes that play a central role in pathological inflammation.
Whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing have identified more than 265 genes in
which mutations cause primary immunodeficiencies and rare forms of severe
inflammatory bowel disease. Combined analysis of inflammatory disease GWAS and
primary immunodeficiencies point to shared proteins and pathways that are
required for immune cell development and protection against infections and are
also associated with pathological inflammation. Finally, sequencing of chromatin 
immunoprecipitates containing specific transcription factors, with parallel RNA
sequencing, has charted epigenetic regulation of gene expression by
proinflammatory transcription factors in immune cells, providing complementary
information to characterize morbid genes at infectious and inflammatory disease
loci.

Campylobacter concisus is an oral bacterium that is associated with inflammatory 
bowel disease. C. concisus has two major genomospecies, which appear to have
different enteric pathogenic potential. Currently, no studies have compared the
genomes of C. concisus strains from different genomospecies. In this study, a
comparative genome analysis of 36 C. concisus strains was conducted including 27 
C. concisus strains sequenced in this study and nine publically available C.
concisus genomes. The C. concisus core-genome was defined and
genomospecies-specific genes were identified. The C. concisus core-genome,
housekeeping genes and 23S rRNA gene consistently divided the 36 strains into two
genomospecies. Two novel genomic islands, CON_PiiA and CON_PiiB, were identified.
CON_PiiA and CON_PiiB islands contained proteins homologous to the type IV
secretion system, LepB-like and CagA-like effector proteins. CON_PiiA islands
were found in 37.5% of enteric C. concisus strains (3/8) isolated from patients
with enteric diseases and none of the oral strains (0/27), which was
statistically significant. This study reports the findings of C. concisus
genomospecies-specific genes, novel genomic islands that contain type IV
secretion system and putative effector proteins, and other new genomic features. 
These data provide novel insights into understanding of the pathogenicity of this
emerging opportunistic pathogen.

Intestinal inflammatory diseases, four of which are discussed here, are
associated with alterations of claudins. In ulcerative colitis, diarrhea and
antigen entry into the mucosa occurs. Claudin-2 is upregulated but data on other 
claudins are still limited or vary (e.g., claudin-1 and -4). Apart from that,
tight junction changes contribute to diarrhea via a leak flux mechanism, while
protection against antigen entry disappears behind epithelial gross lesions
(erosions) and apoptotic foci. Crohn's disease is additionally characterized by a
claudin-5 and claudin-8 reduction which plays an active role in antigen uptake
already before gross lesions appear. In microscopic colitis (MC), upregulation of
claudin-2 expression is weak and a reduction in claudin-4 may be only passively
involved, while sodium malabsorption represents the main diarrheal mechanism.
However, claudin-5 is removed from MC tight junctions which may be an active
trigger for inflammation through antigen uptake along the so-called leaky gut
concept. In celiac disease, primary barrier defects are discussed in the context 
of candidate genes as PARD3 which regulate cell polarity and tight junctions. The
loss of claudin-5 allows small antigens to invade, while the reductions in others
like claudin-3 are rather passive events. Taken together, the specific role of
single tight junction proteins for the onset and perpetuation of inflammation and
the recovery from these diseases is far from being fully understood and is
clearly dependent on the stage of the disease, the background of the other tight 
junction components, the transport activity of the mucosa, and the presence of
other barrier features like gross lesions, an orchestral interplay which is
discussed in this article.

BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed many
susceptibility loci for complex genetic diseases. For most loci, the causal genes
have not been identified. Currently, the identification of candidate genes is
predominantly based on genes that localize close to or within identified loci. We
have recently shown that 92 of the 163 inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-loci
co-localize with non-coding DNA regulatory elements (DREs). Mutations in DREs can
contribute to IBD pathogenesis through dysregulation of gene expression.
Consequently, genes that are regulated by these 92 DREs are to be considered as
candidate genes. This study uses circular chromosome conformation
capture-sequencing (4C-seq) to systematically analyze chromatin-interactions at
IBD susceptibility loci that localize to regulatory DNA.
RESULTS: Using 4C-seq, we identify genomic regions that physically interact with 
the 92 DRE that were found at IBD susceptibility loci. Since the activity of
regulatory elements is cell-type specific, 4C-seq was performed in monocytes,
lymphocytes, and intestinal epithelial cells. Altogether, we identified 902 novel
IBD candidate genes. These include genes specific for IBD-subtypes and many
noteworthy genes including ATG9A and IL10RA. We show that expression of many
novel candidate genes is genotype-dependent and that these genes are upregulated 
during intestinal inflammation in IBD. Furthermore, we identify HNF4α as a
potential key upstream regulator of IBD candidate genes.
CONCLUSIONS: We reveal many novel and relevant IBD candidate genes, pathways, and
regulators. Our approach complements classical candidate gene identification,
links novel genes to IBD and can be applied to any existing GWAS data.

Interleukin-25 (IL-25) is an important regulatory cytokine that has a key role on
mucosal immune tolerance during inflammation response. However, the molecular
mechanism that regulates the colonic IL-25 expression in Crohn's disease (CD)
remains unclear. In this study, IL-25 level was proved to decrease in
2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis mice and IL-10
knockout (KO) spontaneous colitis mice. An inverse correlation between IL-25 and 
miR-31 was discovered in the colons from model mice and CD patients. Furthermore,
target validation analysis demonstrated that miR-31 directly regulated IL-25
expression by binding to its messenger RNA 3'-untranslated region. Changing
colonic miR-31 level in the colitis mice could affect the mucosal
IL-12/23-mediated Th1/Th17 pathway and lead to either amelioration or aggravation
of colonic inflammation. In addition, the therapeutic effects of anti-miR-31 in
TNBS-induced colitis were abolished by colonic treatment with IL-25 antibody or
colonic down-expression of IL-25. Our findings demonstrated that IL-25 could be a
crucial anti-inflammatory cytokine in TNBS-induced colitis and the signaling of
miR-31 targeting IL-25 might be a possible mechanism that regulates
IL-12/23-mediated Th1/Th17 inflammatory responses during colonic inflammation
process. Restoring colonic IL-25 expression and blocking Th1/Th17 responses via
intracolonic administration of miR-31 inhibitor may represent a promising
approach for CD treatment.

BACKGROUND: In eukaryotes, the serpins constitute a wide family of protease
inhibitors regulating many physiological pathways. Many reports stressed the key 
role of serpins in several human physiopathologies including mainly the
inflammatory bowel diseases. In this context, eukaryotic serpins were largely
studied and their use to limit inflammation was reported. In comparison to that, 
bacterial serpins and mainly those from human gut microbiota remain poorly
studied.
RESULTS: The two genes encoding for putative serpins from the human gut bacterium
Eubacterium sireaum, display low sequence identities. These genes were
overexpressed and the encoded proteins, named Siropins, were purified. Activity
studies demonstrated that both purified proteins inhibited serine proteases but
surprisingly they preferentially inhibited two human serine proteases (Human
Neutrophil Elastase and Proteinase3). The biochemical characterization of these
Siropins revealed that Siropin 1 was the most active and stable at low pH values 
while Siropin 2 was more thermoactive and thermostable. Kinetic analysis allowed 
the determination of the stoichiometry of inhibition (SI) which was around 1 and 
of the association rate constants of 7.7 × 104 for the Human Neutrophil Elastase 
and 2.6 × 105 for the Proteinase3. Moreover, both Siropins displayed the ability 
to inhibit proteases usually present in fecal waters. Altogether our data
indicate the high efficiency of Siropins and their probable involvement in the
control of the overall intestine protease activity.
CONCLUSIONS: Here we report the purification and the biochemical characterization
of two novel serpins originated from Eubacterium sireaum, a human
gastro-intestinal tract commensal bacteria. These proteins that we called
Siropins, efficiently inhibited two human proteases reported to be associated
with inflammatory bowel diseases. The determination of the biochemical properties
of these enzymes revealed different temperature and pH behaviours that may
reflect adaptation of this human commensal bacterium to different ecological
environments. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first bacterial serpins
showing an attractive inhibition of fecal proteases recovered from a mice group
with chemically induced inflammation. Altogether our data highlight the
interesting potential of Siropins, and serpins from the human gut microbiota in
general, to be used as new alternative to face inflammatory diseases.

Increasing evidence suggests that miRNAs are widely dysregulated in ulcerative
colitis (UC), potentially affecting UC pathogenesis, diagnosis, and therapy.
microRNA (miR) -206 has been reported to be upregulated in UC; however, its
function and role in UC remain unknown. Here, we elucidate the function of
miR-206 in the pathogenesis of UC. In patients with active-UC, miR-206 and
adenosine A3 receptor (A3AR) levels were significantly upregulated and
downregulated, respectively, and were inversely correlated. A3AR was expressed in
the colon mucosa (particularly in colon epithelial-cell membranes). In HT-29
cells, miR-206 downregulated A3AR mRNA/protein expression by directly targeting
the A3AR 3'-UTR; miR-206 overexpression and knockdown respectively increased and 
decreased TNF-α-induced nuclear NF-κB/p65, p-IκB-α, IKKα, p-IKKα and IL-8/IL-1β
secretion. However, A3AR-siRNA reversed the miR-206 inhibitory effect.
Furthermore, miR-206 increased dextran sodium sulphate-induced colitis severity
(i.e., increased bodyweight loss, DAI score, colon shrinkage, and MPO activity), 
which was partially ameliorated by miR-206-antagomir treatment. miR-206-agomir
treatment potently suppressed A3AR expression and increased NF-κB signalling and 
downstream cytokine (TNF-α/IL-8/IL-1β) expression in the mouse colon, in contrast
to miR-206-antagomir administration. Taken together, our results demonstrated
that miR-206 has a proinflammatory role in UC by downregulating A3AR expression
and activating NF-κB signalling.

Epigenetic alterations may provide important insights into gene-environment
interaction in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Here we observe epigenome-wide
DNA methylation differences in 240 newly-diagnosed IBD cases and 190 controls.
These include 439 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and 5 differentially
methylated regions (DMRs), which we study in detail using whole genome bisulphite
sequencing. We replicate the top DMP (RPS6KA2) and DMRs (VMP1, ITGB2 and TXK) in 
an independent cohort. Using paired genetic and epigenetic data, we delineate
methylation quantitative trait loci; VMP1/microRNA-21 methylation associates with
two polymorphisms in linkage disequilibrium with a known IBD susceptibility
variant. Separated cell data shows that IBD-associated hypermethylation within
the TXK promoter region negatively correlates with gene expression in whole-blood
and CD8+ T cells, but not other cell types. Thus, site-specific DNA methylation
changes in IBD relate to underlying genotype and associate with cell-specific
alteration in gene expression.

Biologics are substances made from a living organism or its products. These
include genes, proteins (eg, antibodies, receptors, enzymes, inhibitors),
recombinant proteins, and fusion proteins. Biologics often are produced using
recombinant DNA technology. For example, monoclonal antibodies are produced by
inserting human genes into immortalized cell cultures, which then produce the
gene product (ie, an antibody) in large quantity. Another approach is to fuse
genetic material from nonhuman sources (eg, mice) with human genetic material.
The fused gene is inserted into a tissue culture that produces the gene product
(ie, a chimeric monoclonal antibody). Biologics are used to manage many
conditions, including malignant and nonmalignant conditions. They are widely used
in the treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (ERBB2 [formerly
HER2 or HER2/neu])-positive breast cancer. They also are used in the treatment of
leukemias, lymphomas, and colorectal and lung cancer. Biologics improve outcomes 
in autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis,
psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, and multiple sclerosis. Other uses include
erythropoietin for renal failure-associated anemia and the new proprotein
convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors for treatment of patients
with persistently elevated low-density lipoprotein levels despite statin
treatment who are at high risk of cardiovascular events.

Significance: Although the wound healing cascade is similar in many tissues, in
the gastrointestinal tract mucosal healing is critical for processes such as
inflammatory bowel disease and ulcers and healing of the mucosa, submucosa, and
serosal layers is needed for surgical anastomoses and for enterocutaneous
fistula. Failure of wound healing can result in complications including
infection, prolonged hospitalization, critical illness, organ failure,
readmission, new or worsening enterocutaneous fistula, and even death. Recent
Advances: Recent advances are relevant for the role of specific micronutrients,
such as vitamin D, trace elements, and the interplay between molecules with pro- 
and antioxidant properties. Our understanding of the role of other small
molecules, genes, proteins, and macronutrients is also rapidly changing. Recent
work has elucidated relationships between oxidative stress, nutritional
supplementation, and glucose metabolism. Thresholds have also been established to
define adequate preoperative nutritional status. Critical Issues: Further work is
needed to establish standards and definitions for measuring the extent of wound
healing, particularly for inflammatory bowel disease and ulcers. In addition, a
mounting body of evidence has determined the need for adequate preoperative
nutritional supplementation for elective surgical procedures. Future Directions: 
A large portion of current work is restricted to model systems in rodents.
Therefore, additional clinical and translational research is needed in this area 
to promote gastrointestinal wound healing in humans, particularly those suffering
from critical illness, patients with enterocutaneous fistula, inflammatory bowel 
disease, and ulcers, and those undergoing surgical procedures.

German shepherd dogs (GSD) in the UK are at increased risk of developing the
Inflammatory Bowel Disaese (IBD). IBD is believed to be a multifactorial immune
mediated disease affecting genetically predisposed dogs. The aim of the current
study was to investigate whether susceptibility to IBD in GSD is associated with 
the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II locus (Dog Leukocyte Antigen,
DLA). Sequence-based genotyping of the three polymorphic DLA genes DLA-DRB1,
-DQA1 and -DQB1 was performed in 56 GSDs affected by IBD and in 50 breed-matched 
controls without any history of gastrointestinal signs. The haplotype
DLA-DRB1*015:02-DQA1*006:01-DQB1*023:01 was found to be present only in the
control population and was associated with a reduced risk of IBD (P<0.001). In
contrast, the haplotype DLA-DRB1*015:01-DQA1*006:01-DQB1*003:01 was associated
with IBD (Odds ratio [OR]=1.93, confidence interval [CI]=1.02-3.67, P=0.05). This
study has identified an association between DLA-type and canine IBD, supporting
the immunogenetic aetiology and immunopathogenesis of this disease.

BACKGROUND: Approximately, one-third to one-half of children with chronic
granulomatous disease (CGD) develop gastrointestinal inflammation characteristic 
of idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), usually Crohn's disease. We
hypothesized that the overall IBD genetic risk, determined by IBD genetic risk
score (GRS), might in part determine IBD development in CGD.
METHODS: We reviewed medical records to establish IBD diagnoses in CGD subjects
seen at NIAID. IBD risk single nucleotide polymorphism genotypes were determined 
using the Immunochip, and GRS were estimated by Mangrove.
RESULTS: Among 157 white patients with CGD, 55 were confirmed, 78 excluded, and
24 were uncertain for IBD. Two hundred one established, independent European IBD 
risk single nucleotide polymorphisms passed quality control. After sample quality
control and removing non-IBD CGD patients with perianal disease, mean GRS for 40 
unrelated patients with CGD-IBD was higher than 53 CGD non-IBD patients (in
log2-scale 0.08 ± 1.62 versus -0.67 ± 1.64, P = 0.026) but lower than 239 IBD
Genetics Consortium (IBDGC) young-onset Crohn's disease cases (0.76 ± 1.60, P =
0.025). GRS for non-IBD CGD was similar to 609 IBDGC controls (-0.69 ± 1.60, P = 
0.95). Seven established IBD single nucleotide polymorphisms were nominally
significant among CGD-IBD versus CGD non-IBD, including those near LACC1 (P =
0.005), CXCL14 (P = 0.007), and TNFSF15 (P = 0.016).
CONCLUSIONS: The weight of the common IBD risk alleles are significant
determinants of IBD in CGD. However, IBD risk gene burden among CGD children with
IBD is significantly lower than that in nonsyndromic pediatric Crohn's disease,
congruent with the concept that defective superoxide production in CGD is also a 
major IBD risk factor. Individual IBD genes might interact with the CGD defect to
cause IBD in CGD.

BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn disease (CD) can be
challenging given the overlapping features. Knowledge of microRNAs in IBD has
expanded recently and supports that microRNAs play an important role. This study 
aimed to identify novel microRNA biomarkers through comprehensive genome-wide
sequencing to distinguish UC from CD.
DESIGN: Illumina next generation sequencing was performed on nondysplastic
fresh-frozen colonic mucosa of the distal-most colectomy from 19 patients (10 UC 
and 9 CD) and 18 patients with diverticular disease serving as controls.
RESULTS: USeq software package identified 44 microRNAs with altered expression
(fold change ≥2 and false discovery rate ≤0.10) compared to controls. Among them,
a panel of 11 microRNAs was aberrantly expressed between UC and CD. qRT-PCR
validation assays performed on frozen tissue from additional samples of UC (n=20)
and CD (n=10) confirmed specific differential expression of miR-147b, miR-194-2, 
miR-383, miR-615 and miR-1826 (P<0.05). In addition, pathway analysis identified 
target genes of epithelial adhesion junction, integrin, glycolysis and cell cycle
that involve in signaling pathways of TGF-β, STAT3, IL-8 and PI3L/AKT/mTOR.
CONCLUSION: Identification of differentially expressed microRNAs in UC and CD
supports the hypothesis that UC and CD are regulated by distinct pathophysiologic
mechanisms. MicroRNA panels show promise as diagnostic biomarkers for the
subtyping of inflammatory bowel disease.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Inflammatory bowel diseases are chronic, relapsing, inflammatory
conditions. They have a genetic backround resulting in patient susceptibility.
The aim of our study is to investigate the involvement of IL23R, JAK2, and STAT3 
polymorphisms in inflammatory bowel diseases in a Turkish population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Polymorphisms in IL23R (rs11209026), JAK2 (rs10758669),
and STAT3 (rs3816769, rs2293152, rs744166, rs957970, rs8074524) were genotyped in
69 Crohn's disease patients, 157 ulcerative colitis patients, and 89 healthy
controls.
RESULTS: The presence of (C) in rs10758669, (T) and (TT) in rs957970, and (TT) in
rs744166 were found to increase the susceptibility to Crohn's disease (p=0.049,
p=0.016, p=0.010, p=0.035, respectively), while rs2293152 (GC), rs744166 (CT),
and rs957970 (CT) provide protection against Crohn's disease (p=0.007, p=0.043,
p=0.043, respectively). While rs2293152 (GC) was protective, rs2293152 (CC)
increased the susceptibility to ulcerative colitis (p=0.009, p=0.001). All the
polymorphisms were associated with age-at-diagnosis, except rs11209026.
Furthermore, rs2293152 was associated with an extension in ulcerative colitis,
while rs10758669, rs3816769, rs744166, rs2293152, and rs957970 were associated
with the subphenotype in Crohn's disease. The presence of rs10758669 (AC) was
protective against perianal Crohn's disease (p=0.016). Additionally, rs10758669
and rs2293152 in Crohn's disease and rs8074524, rs3816769, and rs10758669 in
ulcerative colitis were associated with the requirement of immunsuppression.
Finally, rs8074524 and rs10758669 in Crohn's disease and rs11209026 in ulcerative
colitis were associated with disease-related operation.
CONCLUSION: This is the first study of the single marker association of IL23R,
JAK2, and STAT3 polymorphisms with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease in a
Turkish population. It was demonstrated that these polymorphisms may be effective
in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease in this Turkish population.

Disruption of intestinal homeostasis can lead to inflammatory bowel diseases
endowed susceptibility genes and environmental factors affecting intestinal
accumulation and activation of colitogenic phagocytes. Plasmacytoid dendritic
cells (pDCs) are immune cells that had been proposed to control innate and
adaptive immunity through the massive secretion of type I interferon (IFN-I).
However, the contribution of pDCs to the progression of intestinal inflammation
remains unclear. Here we show a critical role of pDCs in the initiation of acute 
colonic inflammation using T-cell-independent acute colitis model with a
selective ablation of pDCs. Although pDCs accumulated in the inflamed colon upon 
mucosal injury, deficiency of pDCs attenuated the development of acute colitis
independent of IFN-I signaling, accompanied by the diminished colonic production 
of proinflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, deficiency of pDCs impaired the
mobilization of colitogenic phagocytes into the inflamed colon possibly mediated 
by the abrogated mucosal production of C-C chemokine receptor 2 ligand. Thus, our
findings highlight a critical role of pDCs in the induction of the colonic
inflammation that regulates the colonic accumulation of inflammatory phagocytes
leading to the initiation and exacerbation of acute colitis, and they may serve a
key role in controlling gut mucosal immune homeostasis.

University.

BACKGROUND: To date, 481 ultraconserved regions (UCRs) have been discovered in
human genome. We aimed to investigate the transcribed UCR (T-UCR) characteristics
in Crohn's disease (CD ) and determine whether T-UCR uc.261 participated in
intestinal mucosa barrier damage.
METHODS: T-UCRs were screened in active CD mucosa using the Arraystar Human T-UCR
Microarray and validated with quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR,
together with tight junction proteins (TJPs) including junctional adhesion
molecule-A, occludin, claudin-1, and zonula occluden-1. T-UCR uc.261 in active CD
mucosa was validated by RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization. Caco2 and T84
cells were employed to determine transepithelial electrical resistance. Cdc42,
protein kinase C ζ, PAR3, and PAR6 were assessed with quantitative real-time
reverse transcription PCR and Western blotting. The assembly of TJPs was detected
using cell immunofluorescence assay.
RESULTS: Four T-UCRs were significantly upregulated (uc.290-, uc.144-, uc.261-,
and uc.477+) and 4 T-UCRs were downregulated (uc.166-, uc.141-, uc.478+, and
uc.479+). Uc.261 was inversely correlated with transepithelial electrical
resistance during tight junction formation. The levels of TJPs were diminished in
active CD mucosa. Most uc.261s were located in the cytoplasm of colonic
epithelial cells. Overexpression of uc.261 reduced transepithelial electrical
resistance, inhibited the expression and assembly of TJPs, activated Cdc42, and
suppressed protein kinase C ζ. Silencing of uc.261 in TNF-α-treated cells
reversed the tight junction damage.
CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of uc.261 participates in intestinal mucosa barrier
damage. Suppression of uc.261 reverses the damage to tight junction in
inflammation. Attenuation of uc.261 overexpression might be a rational strategy
to manage patients with CD.

BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental
disorder that tends to co-occur with other diseases, including asthma,
inflammatory bowel disease, infections, cerebral palsy, dilated cardiomyopathy,
muscular dystrophy, and schizophrenia. However, the molecular basis of this
co-occurrence, and whether it is due to a shared component that influences both
pathophysiology and environmental triggering of illness, has not been elucidated.
To address this, we deploy a three-tiered transcriptomic meta-analysis that
functions at the gene, pathway, and disease levels across ASD and its
co-morbidities.
RESULTS: Our analysis reveals a novel shared innate immune component between ASD 
and all but three of its co-morbidities that were examined. In particular, we
find that the Toll-like receptor signaling and the chemokine signaling pathways, 
which are key pathways in the innate immune response, have the highest shared
statistical significance. Moreover, the disease genes that overlap these two
innate immunity pathways can be used to classify the cases of ASD and its
co-morbidities vs. controls with at least 70 % accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS: This finding suggests that a neuropsychiatric condition and the
majority of its non-brain-related co-morbidities share a dysregulated signal that
serves as not only a common genetic basis for the diseases but also as a link to 
environmental triggers. It also raises the possibility that treatment and/or
prophylaxis used for disorders of innate immunity may be successfully used for
ASD patients with immune-related phenotypes.

Recognition and removal of apoptotic cells by professional phagocytes, including 
dendritic cells and macrophages, preserves immune self-tolerance and prevents
chronic inflammation and autoimmune pathologies. The diverse array of phagocytes 
that reside within different tissues, combined with the necessarily prompt nature
of apoptotic cell clearance, makes it difficult to study this process in situ.
The full spectrum of functions executed by tissue-resident phagocytes in response
to homeostatic apoptosis, therefore, remains unclear. Here we show that mouse
apoptotic intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), which undergo continuous renewal to
maintain optimal barrier and absorptive functions, are not merely extruded to
maintain homeostatic cell numbers, but are also sampled by a single subset of
dendritic cells and two macrophage subsets within a well-characterized network of
phagocytes in the small intestinal lamina propria. Characterization of the
transcriptome within each subset before and after in situ sampling of apoptotic
IECs revealed gene expression signatures unique to each phagocyte, including
macrophage-specific lipid metabolism and amino acid catabolism, and a
dendritic-cell-specific program of regulatory CD4+ T-cell activation. A common
'suppression of inflammation' signature was noted, although the specific genes
and pathways involved varied amongst dendritic cells and macrophages, reflecting 
specialized functions. Apoptotic IECs were trafficked to mesenteric lymph nodes
exclusively by the dendritic cell subset and served as critical determinants for 
the induction of tolerogenic regulatory CD4+ T-cell differentiation. Several of
the genes that were differentially expressed by phagocytes bearing apoptotic IECs
overlapped with susceptibility genes for inflammatory bowel disease.
Collectively, these findings provide new insights into the consequences of
apoptotic cell sampling, advance our understanding of how homeostasis is
maintained within the mucosa and set the stage for development of novel
therapeutics to alleviate chronic inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory
bowel disease.

BACKGROUND: CHI3L1 is a chitinase-like protein without enzymatic activity,
produced by activated macrophages, chondrocytes, neutrophils. Recent studies on
arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel diseases suggest that chitinases are
important in inflammatory processes and tissue remodeling, but their production
by human T cells, has never been reported.
METHODS: A microarray analysis of gene expression profile was performed on Th17
and classic Th1 cell clones and CHI3L1 was found among the up-regulated genes on 
Th17 cells. Different types of helper T cell clones (TCCs) were then evaluated by
Real Time PCR (RT-PCR) for CHI3L1 mRNA expression; protein expression was
investigated in cell lysates by western blotting and in cultures supernatants by 
ELISA. ELISA was also used to measure CHI3L1 in the serum and in the synovial
fluid (SF) of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) patients.
RESULTS: At mRNA level CHI3L1 was highly expressed by Th17, Th17/Th1, non classic
Th1 and even in Th17/Th2 cell clones, whereas it was virtually absent in CD161-
classic Th1 and Th2 TCCs. CHI3L1 was also detected in cell culture supernatants
of Th17 and Th17-derived cells but not of classic Th1. Moreover CHI3L1 was higher
in the SF than in serum of JIA patients, and it positively correlated with the
frequency of Th17 and non-classic Th1 cells in SF. CHI3L1 in SF also positively
correlated with the C reactive protein (CRP) serum levels, and with the levels of
some proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and p40, which is the common subunit
of IL12 and IL23.
CONCLUSIONS: Here we describe for the first time CHI3L1 production by T cells
owing the Th17 family. Moreover the positive correlation found between the
frequency of Th17 and Th17-derived cell subsets and CHI3L1 levels in SF of JIA
patients, in agreement with the suggested role of these cells in inflammatory
process, candidates CHI3L1 as a possible biological target in JIA treatment.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Little is known about the mechanisms by which chronic
inflammation contributes to carcinogenesis, such as the development of colon
tumors in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases. Specific microRNA (miRNAs)
can function as suppressors or oncogenes, and widespread alterations in miRNA
expression have been associated with tumorigenesis. We studied whether
alterations in miRNA function contribute to inflammation-associated colon
carcinogenesis.
METHODS: We studied the effects of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis
factor, interleukin-1α (IL1A), and IL1β (IL1B), on miRNA function, measured by
activity of reporter constructs containing miRNA-binding sites in their 3'
untranslated regions, in human 293T embryonic kidney, Caco-2, HT29, and HCT116
colon carcinoma cells, as well as dicer+/+ and dicer-/-, and Apobec3+/+ and
Apobec3-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Cells were analyzed by immunoblots,
immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry. We generated transgenic mice expressing
reporter constructs regulated by LET7B, MIR122, and MIR29b response elements;
some mice were given injections of miRNA inhibitors (anti-MIR122 or anti-LET7B), 
a negative control, or tumor necrosis factor. Liver tissues were collected and
analyzed by immunoblotting. Reporter mice were given azoxymethane followed by
dextran sulfate sodium to induce colitis and colon tumors; some mice were given
the ROCK inhibitor fasudil along with these agents (ROCK inhibitors increase
miRNA function). Colon tissues were collected and analyzed by
immunohistochemistry, immunoblots, and fluorescence microscopy.
RESULTS: Incubation of cell lines with inflammatory cytokines reduced the ability
of miRNAs to down-regulate expression from reporter constructs; dicer was
required for this effect, so these cytokines relieve miRNA-dependent reductions
in expression. The cytokines promoted degradation of APOBEC3G, which normally
promotes miRNA loading into argonaute 2-related complexes. Mice with colitis had 
reduced miRNA function, based on increased expression of reporter genes.
Administration of fasudil to mice did not reduce the severity of colitis that
developed but greatly reduced the numbers of colon tumors formed (mean 2
tumors/colon in mice given fasudil vs 9 tumors/colon in mice given control
agent). We made similar observations in IL10-deficient mice.
CONCLUSIONS: We found inflammatory cytokines to reduce the activities of miRNAs. 
In mice with colitis, activities of miRNAs are reduced; administration of an
agent that increases miRNA function prevents colon tumor formation in these mice.
This pathway might be targeted to prevent colon carcinogenesis in patients with
inflammatory bowel diseases.

BACKGROUND: In active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), microRNA expression
profiling consistently features disease-specific signatures, and microRNA-21
(miR-21) has been shown to be upregulated in the inflamed colon of patients with 
active ulcerative colitis (UC). However, the cellular sources of miR-21
expression in IBD tissues have not yet been identified. We sought to determine
the expression levels of miR-21 and one of its downstream target genes,
programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), in CD3 T cells isolated from the colonic mucosa 
of patients with active IBD, inactive IBD, and non-IBD controls.
METHODS: Colonic biopsies were treated with collagenase V. CD3 T cells were
isolated using MACS CD3 positive selection. Total RNA was converted to cDNA.
Real-time PCR reactions were performed with PCR primers for miR-21, SNORD95,
PDCD4, and GAPDH.
RESULTS: The expression of miR-21 was statistically significantly downregulated
in CD3 T cells from patients with UC in remission as compared to active disease
(P = 0.0193). miR-21 negatively regulates PDCD4 expression. As predicted, the
mRNA level of PCDC4 in CD3 T cells was upregulated in UC and Crohn's disease in
remission as compared to active disease (UC active versus UC remission: P =
0.0008, Crohn's disease active versus Crohn's disease remission: P = 0.0215) and 
in patients with UC in remission as compared to healthy controls (P = 0.0226).
CONCLUSIONS: Although miR-21 expression is downregulated, PDCD4 is upregulated in
CD3 T cells during the remission phase of UC. Our results indicate that miR-21
and related pathways in colonic T cells may play a role in limiting pathogenic
T-cell responses and may constitute future target candidates to induce remission 
in UC.

BACKGROUND: X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) deficiency is a rare
immunodeficiency that is characterized by recurrent hemophagocytic
lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and splenomegaly and sometimes associated with
refractory inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative therapy, the outcomes of HSCT for
XIAP deficiency remain unsatisfactory compared with those for SLAM-associated
protein deficiency and familial HLH.
AIM: To investigate the outcomes and adverse events of HSCT for patients with
XIAP deficiency, a national survey was conducted.
METHODS: A spreadsheet questionnaire was sent to physicians who had provided HSCT
treatment for patients with XIAP deficiency in Japan.
RESULTS: Up to the end of September 2016, 10 patients with XIAP deficiency had
undergone HSCT in Japan, 9 of whom (90%) had survived. All surviving patients had
received a fludarabine-based reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen.
Although 5 patients developed post-HSCT HLH, 4 of them survived after etoposide
administration. In addition, the IBD associated with XIAP deficiency improved
remarkably after HSCT in all affected cases.
CONCLUSION: The RIC regimen and HLH control might be important factors for
successful HSCT outcomes, with improved IBD, in patients with XIAP deficiency.

NOD2 contributes to the innate immune response and to the homeostasis of the
intestinal mucosa. In response to its bacterial ligand, NOD2 interacts with RICK 
and activates the NF-κB and MAPK pathways, inducing gene transcription and
synthesis of proteins required to initiate a balanced immune response. Mutations 
in NOD2 have been associated with an increased risk of Crohn's Disease (CD), a
disabling inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Because NOD2 signaling plays a key
role in CD, it is important to further characterize the network of protein
interacting with NOD2. Using yeast two hybrid (Y2H) screens, we identified new
NOD2 interacting proteins (NIP). The primary interaction was confirmed by
coimmunoprecipitation and/or bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)
experiments for 11 of these proteins (ANKHD1, CHMP5, SDCCAG3, TRIM41, LDOC1,
PPP1R12C, DOCK7, VIM, KRT15, PPP2R3B, and C10Orf67). These proteins are involved 
in diverse functions, including endosomal sorting complexes required for
transport (ESCRT), cytoskeletal architecture and signaling regulation.
Additionally, we show that the interaction of 8 NIPs is compromised with the 3
main CD associated NOD2 mutants (R702W, G908R and 1007fs). Furthermore, to
determine whether these NOD2 protein partners could be encoded by IBD
susceptibility genes, a transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) was performed on
101 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the main corresponding haplotypes 
in genes coding for 15 NIPs using a set of 343 IBD families with 556 patients.
Overall this work did not increase the number of IBD susceptibility genes but
extends the NOD2 protein interaction network and suggests that NOD2 interactome
and signaling depend upon the NOD2 mutation profile in CD.

AIM: To determine whether genetic polymorphism of the ATG16L2 gene is
functionally associated with the incidence of Crohn's disease (CD) in the Chinese
population.
METHOD: The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs11235604 of the ATG16L2 gene
was genotyped in 363 patients with CD and 486 healthy volunteers from the Chinese
Han population. The distributions of the genotype and allele frequency were
compared between patients and controls by the chi-square test. The mRNA
expression of ATG16L2 in T cells was evaluated by real-time PCR. Comparisons of
mRNA expression of ATG16L2 between patients and controls and between patients
with genotype CC and genotype CT/TT were performed with the Student's t-test.
RESULTS: Compared with the controls, patients were found to have a significantly 
higher proportion of genotype TT (5.5% vs 2.5%, P = 0.04). Allele T was the risk 
allele for the disease (16.3% vs 12.3%, P = 0.02), with an odds ratio of 1.31
(95% CI 1.04-1.67). The ATG16L2 mRNA of the patients was significantly reduced
when compared with the controls (0.0044 ± 0.0018 vs 0.0064 ± 0.0023, P < 0.001). 
Patients with genotype TT/CT had a significant lower level of ATG16L2 mRNA than
patients with genotype CC (0.0036 ± 0.0016 vs 0.0053 ± 0.0028, P = 0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: ATG16L2 is a susceptibility gene for CD in the Chinese population.
The rs11235604 SNP is remarkably associated with downregulation of the expression
of ATG16L2. Further investigation into the gene's function is warranted for a
comprehensive knowledge of the contribution of the variant to the development of 
CD.

Cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) is a component of a licensed oral cholera vaccine. 
However, CTB has pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects whose impacts on the gut
are not fully understood. Here, we found that oral administration in mice of a
plant-made recombinant CTB (CTBp) significantly increased several immune cell
populations in the colon lamina propria. Global gene expression analysis revealed
that CTBp had more pronounced impacts on the colon than the small intestine, with
significant activation of TGFβ-mediated pathways in the colon epithelium. The
clinical relevance of CTBp-induced impacts on colonic mucosa was examined. In a
human colon epithelial model using Caco2 cells, CTBp, but not the non-GM1-binding
mutant G33D-CTBp, induced TGFβ-mediated wound healing. In a dextran sodium
sulfate (DSS) acute colitis mouse model, oral administration of CTBp protected
against colon mucosal damage as manifested by mitigated body weight loss,
decreased histopathological scores, and blunted escalation of inflammatory
cytokine levels while inducing wound healing-related genes. Furthermore, biweekly
oral administration of CTBp significantly reduced disease severity and
tumorigenesis in the azoxymethane/DSS model of ulcerative colitis and colon
cancer. Altogether, these results demonstrate CTBp's ability to enhance mucosal
healing in the colon, highlighting its potential application in ulcerative
colitis therapy besides cholera vaccination.

OBJECTIVE: UC is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colonic mucosa. Growing
evidence supports a role for epithelial cell defects in driving pathology.
Moreover, long-lasting changes in the epithelial barrier have been reported in
quiescent UC. Our aim was to investigate whether epithelial cell defects could
originate from changes in the epithelial compartment imprinted by the disease.
DESIGN: Epithelial organoid cultures (EpOCs) were expanded ex vivo from the
intestinal crypts of non-IBD controls and patients with UC. EpOCs were induced to
differentiate (d-EpOCs), and the total RNA was extracted for microarray and
quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analyses. Whole intestinal samples were used to
determine mRNA expression by qPCR, or protein localisation by immunostaining.
RESULTS: EpOCs from patients with UC maintained self-renewal potential and the
capability to give rise to differentiated epithelial cell lineages comparable
with control EpOCs. Nonetheless, a group of genes was differentially regulated in
the EpOCs and d-EpOCs of patients with UC, including genes associated with
antimicrobial defence (ie, LYZ, PLA2G2A), with secretory (ie, ZG16, CLCA1) and
absorptive (ie, AQP8, MUC12) functions, and with a gastric phenotype (ie, ANXA10,
CLDN18 and LYZ). A high rate of concordance was found in the expression profiles 
of the organoid cultures and whole colonic tissues from patients with UC.
CONCLUSIONS: Permanent changes in the colonic epithelium of patients with UC
could be promoted by alterations imprinted in the stem cell compartment. These
changes may contribute to perpetuation of the disease.

OBJECTIVE: Lymphocyte recruitment to the inflamed gut is increased in UC.
Inhibition of this cell trafficking by vedolizumab (VDZ) was successful in
inducing and maintaining remission and in induction of endoscopic mucosal
healing. There are no data on histological healing with VDZ. We studied
histological changes following VDZ therapy and compared gene expression in
patients with UC before and after therapy.
DESIGN: Forty-one patients with UC from GEMINI I and LTS were studied before and 
at three time points (weeks 6/12/52) following VDZ therapy. Colonic biopsies were
scored using the Geboes index and correlated with Mayo endoscopic subscore. Gene 
expression was analysed using Affymetrix gene arrays.
RESULTS: Fifty-five per cent of patients achieving endoscopic healing (= Mayo
endoscopic subscore 0-1) with VDZ at the studied time points also had
histological healing (= Geboes grade 0-1). In most healers, some residual
histological changes (eg, disturbed architecture and increased mononuclear cell
infiltrate) were still observed, although this was less at week 52. VDZ restored 
expression of many inflammatory genes in patients with endoscopic healing only at
week 52 and not before. In VDZ healers, the expression of many genes remained
dysregulated at weeks 6/12/52 compared with controls.
CONCLUSIONS: VDZ induces histological healing in >50% of patients with endoscopic
healing, with maximal effect at week 52. VDZ also restored, although
incompletely, the colonic expression of many immune-related genes in patients
with UC achieving endoscopic healing at week 52. However, persistent histological
and gene dysregulations did remain even in healers, suggesting that maintenance
therapy will be necessary to control the intestinal inflammation.

OBJECTIVE: Patients with IBD display substantial heterogeneity in clinical
characteristics. We hypothesise that individual differences in the complex
interaction of the host genome and the gut microbiota can explain the onset and
the heterogeneous presentation of IBD. Therefore, we performed a case-control
analysis of the gut microbiota, the host genome and the clinical phenotypes of
IBD.
DESIGN: Stool samples, peripheral blood and extensive phenotype data were
collected from 313 patients with IBD and 582 truly healthy controls, selected
from a population cohort. The gut microbiota composition was assessed by
tag-sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. All participants were genotyped. We composed
genetic risk scores from 11 functional genetic variants proven to be associated
with IBD in genes that are directly involved in the bacterial handling in the
gut: NOD2, CARD9, ATG16L1, IRGM and FUT2.
RESULTS: Strikingly, we observed significant alterations of the gut microbiota of
healthy individuals with a high genetic risk for IBD: the IBD genetic risk score 
was significantly associated with a decrease in the genus Roseburia in healthy
controls (false discovery rate 0.017). Moreover, disease location was a major
determinant of the gut microbiota: the gut microbiota of patients with colonic
Crohn's disease (CD) is different from that of patients with ileal CD, with a
decrease in alpha diversity associated to ileal disease (p=3.28×10-13).
CONCLUSIONS: We show for the first time that genetic risk variants associated
with IBD influence the gut microbiota in healthy individuals. Roseburia spp are
acetate-to-butyrate converters, and a decrease has already been observed in
patients with IBD.

OBJECTIVE: The clinical presentation and course of Crohn's disease (CD) is highly
variable. We sought to better understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms
that guide this heterogeneity, and characterise the cellular processes associated
with disease phenotypes.
DESIGN: We examined both gene expression and gene regulation (chromatin
accessibility) in non-inflamed colon tissue from a cohort of adult patients with 
CD and control patients. To support the generality of our findings, we analysed
previously published expression data from a large cohort of treatment-naïve
paediatric CD and control ileum.
RESULTS: We found that adult patients with CD clearly segregated into two classes
based on colon tissue gene expression-one that largely resembled the normal colon
and one where certain genes showed expression patterns normally specific to the
ileum. These classes were supported by changes in gene regulatory profiles
observed at the level of chromatin accessibility, reflective of a fundamental
shift in underlying molecular phenotypes. Furthermore, gene expression from the
ilea of a treatment-naïve cohort of paediatric patients with CD could be
similarly subdivided into colon-like and ileum-like classes. Finally, expression 
patterns within these CD subclasses highlight large-scale differences in the
immune response and aspects of cellular metabolism, and were associated with
multiple clinical phenotypes describing disease behaviour, including rectal
disease and need for colectomy.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results strongly suggest that these molecular signatures define 
two clinically relevant forms of CD irrespective of tissue sampling location,
patient age or treatment status.

Immunological molecules are implicated in inflammatory disorders, including
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; Crohn disease [CD] and ulcerative colitis [UC]).
Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) are also genetically variable
proteins involved in immune function. They are expressed by NK cells and certain 
T lymphocytes, regulate specificity and function by interaction with HLA Class I 
molecules, may be either inhibitory or activating and are polymorphic both in
terms of alleles and haplotype gene content. Genetic associations between
activating KIRs and certain autoimmune and inflammatory diseases have been
reported; however, a possible association between KIR and IBD remains unclear.
The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between KIR repertoire
and IBD pathologies in a Spanish cohort. KIR variability was analyzed using
PCR-sequence specific oligonucleotide probes (SSOP). Inhibitory KIR2DL5 was found
more frequently in UC and IBD patient groups than in healthy controls (P = 0.028 
and P = 0.01, respectively), as was activating KIR2DS1 (P = 0.02, Pc > 0.05, UC
vs. Controls; P = 0.001, Pc = 0.01, IBD vs Controls; P = 0.01, Pc > 0.05,
Controls vs CR), KIR2DS5 (P = 0.0028, Pc = 0.04, Controls vs UC; P = 0.0001,
Pc = 0.0017, Controls vs IBD; P = 0.01, Pc > 0.05, Controls vs CD) and KIR3DS1
(P = 0.012, Pc > 0.05, Controls vs IBD). Our data suggest that imbalance between 
activating and inhibitory KIR may partially explain the different pathogeneses of
these IBDs and that there is a hypothetical role for the telomeric B region
(which contains both KIR2DS5 and KIR2DS1) in these diseases.

Genes and pathways in which inactivation dampens tissue inflammation present new 
opportunities for understanding the pathogenesis of common human inflammatory
diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple
sclerosis. We identified a mutation in the gene encoding the deubiquitination
enzyme USP15 (Usp15L749R) that protected mice against both experimental cerebral 
malaria (ECM) induced by Plasmodium berghei and experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE). Combining immunophenotyping and RNA sequencing in brain 
(ECM) and spinal cord (EAE) revealed that Usp15L749R-associated resistance to
neuroinflammation was linked to dampened type I interferon responses in situ. In 
hematopoietic cells and in resident brain cells, USP15 was coexpressed with, and 
functionally acted together with the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM25 to positively
regulate type I interferon responses and to promote pathogenesis during
neuroinflammation. The USP15-TRIM25 dyad might be a potential target for
intervention in acute or chronic states of neuroinflammation.

Chronic intestinal inflammatory disorders, such as Inflammatory Bowel Diseases
(IBDs), are characterized by excessive release of proinflammatory mediators,
intestinal barrier dysfunction and excessive activation of NF-kB cascade.
Previous studies shown that TNF-α plays a central role in intestinal inflammation
of IBDs and supported beneficial effects of flavonoids against chronic
inflammatory diseases. In this study, we employed an in vitro model of acute
intestinal inflammation using intestinal Caco-2 cells exposed to TNF-α. The
protective effects of cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G), an anthocyanin widely
distributed in mediterranean diet, were then evaluated. Caco-2 cells exposure to 
TNF-α activated NF-kB proinflammatory pathway and induced IL6 and COX-2
expression. Cells pretreatment for 24h with C3G (20-40μM) prevented TNF-α-induced
changes, and improved intracellular redox status. Our results demonstrated that
C3G, also without any kind of stimulus, increased the translocation of the
transcription factor Nrf2 into the nucleus so activating antioxidant and
detoxifying genes. In conclusion, C3G exhibited protective effects through the
inhibition of NF-kB signalling in Caco-2 cells and these beneficial effects
appear to be due to its ability to activate cellular protective responses
modulated by Nrf2. These data suggest that anthocyanins could contribute, as
complementary or preventive approaches, to the management of chronic inflammatory
diseases.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
disease, is a chronic, recrudescent disease that invades the gastrointestinal
tract, and it requires surgery or lifelong medicinal therapy. The conventional
medicinal therapies for IBD, such as anti-inflammatories, glucocorticoids, and
immunosuppressants, are limited because of their systemic adverse effects and
toxicity during long-term treatment. RNA interference (RNAi) precisely regulates 
susceptibility genes to decrease the expression of proinflammatory cytokines
related to IBD, which effectively alleviates IBD progression and promotes
intestinal mucosa recovery. RNAi molecules generally include short interfering
RNA (siRNA) and microRNA (miRNA). However, naked RNA tends to degrade in vivo as 
a consequence of endogenous ribonucleases and pH variations. Furthermore, RNAi
treatment may cause unintended off-target effects and immunostimulation.
Therefore, nanovectors of siRNA and miRNA were introduced to circumvent these
obstacles. Herein, we introduce non-viral nanosystems of RNAi molecules and
discuss these systems in detail. Additionally, the delivery barriers and
challenges associated with RNAi molecules will be discussed from the perspectives
of developing efficient delivery systems and potential clinical use.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Although many progresses have been achieved for inflammatory 
bowel disease (IBD), it is still remained as idiopathic disease to be completely 
controlled. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified as key players in many human 
diseases through degradation or translational inhibition of target genes. Because
role of miRNAs in IBD is not completely understood yet, we need to identify
miRNAs as novel targets for treatment of IBD.
METHODS: Microarray analysis for miRNAs was performed using dextran sulfate
sodium-induced colitis samples and selected differentially regulated miRNAs.
Candidate genes were validated using in vitro system and IBD patient samples.
Molecular mechanism for regulation of inflammatory signaling was identified using
gene modulation system of miRNAs.
RESULTS: We selected 14 upregulated and 15 downregulated miRNAs through
microarray analysis. Among candidate miRNAs, significant upregulation of miR-132 
and miR-223 was confirmed in inflamed mouse tissues as well as human IBD patient 
tissues. Through bioinformatics analysis, we identified FOXO3a as direct target
of miRNAs and confirmed regulatory mechanism using luciferase assay. Expression
of miRNAs clearly suppressed the level of IκBα through downregulation of FOXO3a, 
leading to enhanced NF-κB signaling to promote the production of pro-inflammatory
cytokines. The downregulation of FOXO3a concurrent with upregulation of cytokines
was significantly reversed by sequestration of miRNAs with miRNA sponges.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provided the evidences that miR-132 and 223 are
critical mediators in positive circuit for pathogenesis of IBD by negatively
regulating FOXO3a to enhance the expression of inflammatory cytokines and can be 
a good therapeutic target for IBD treatment.

Recent studies have greatly improved our insight into the genetic background of
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). New high-throughput technologies and
large-scale international collaborations have contributed to the identification
of 200 independent genetic risk loci for IBD. However, in most of these loci, it 
is unclear which gene conveys the risk for IBD. More importantly, it is unclear
which variant within or near the gene is causal to the disease. Using targeted
GWAS, imputation, resequencing of risk loci, and in silico fine-mapping of
densely typed loci, several causal variants have been identified in IBD risk
genes, and various pathological pathways have been uncovered. Current research in
the field of IBD focuses on the effect of these causal variants on gene
expression and protein function. However, more elements than only the genome must
be taken into account to disentangle the multifactorial pathology of IBD. The
genetic risk loci identified to date only explain a small part of genetic
variance in disease risk. Currently, large multi-omics studies are incorporating 
factors ranging from the gut microbiome to the environment. In this review, we
present the progress that has been made in IBD genetic research and stress the
importance of studying causality to increase our understanding of the
pathogenesis of IBD. We highlight important causal genetic variants in the
candidate genes NOD2, ATG16L1, IRGM, IL23R, CARD9, RNF186, and PRDM1. We describe
their downstream effects on protein function and their direct effects on the gut 
immune system. Furthermore, we discuss the future role of genetics in unravelling
disease mechanisms in IBD. Copyright © 2016 Pathological Society of Great Britain

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by
chronic, relapsing intestinal inflammation. Autoimmune liver disease (AILD) may
be involved in IBD as an extra-intestinal manifestation (EIM). Epidemiologic and 
anatomic evidence have demonstrated an intimate crosstalk between the gut and the
liver. In this review, we briefly introduced nine groups of susceptibility loci
shared by inflammatory bowel and autoimmune liver disease for the first time. The
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) evidence of pathways involving crosstalk
between the gut and the liver is clarified and explained. It has been found that 
HNF4-α, GPR35, MST1R, CARD9, IL2/IL21/IL2R, BACH2, TNFRSF14, MAdCAM-1, and FUT2
are the genes involved in tight junction formation, macrophage function, T helper
cell or Treg cell cycle and function, TNF secretion, lymphocyte homing or
intestinal dysbiosis, respectively. The intimate crosstalk between the gut and
liver in immunity is also highlighted and discussed in this review.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease where a loss
of tolerance to nuclear antigens leads to inflammation in multiple organ systems.
The cause of SLE remains ill defined, although it is known that a complex
interplay between genes and environment is necessary for disease development. In 
recent years, case studies have reported that the incidence of SLE in the USA,
for example, has increased by approximately 3 fold. Although the reason for this 
is likely to be multifactorial, it has been hypothesized that the increasing
incidence of autoimmune disease is due to considerable shifts in the bacterial
communities resident the gut, collectively known as the gut microbiota, following
a change in diet and the widespread introduction of antibiotics. Furthermore, a
growing body of evidence suggests that the gut microbiota plays a role in the
development of a range of autoimmune diseases including inflammatory bowel
disease, multiple sclerosis, type one diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis. In this 
review, we summarize how advances in DNA-based sequencing technologies have been 
critical in providing baseline information concerning the gut microbiota in
health and how variation amongst individuals in controlled by multiples factors
including age, genetics, environment and the diet. We also discuss the importance
of the gut microbiota in the development of a healthy immune system and how
changes in particular bacterial phyla have been associated with immune
abnormalities in animal models of autoimmune disease. Finally, in order to place 
the data in a clinical context, we highlight recent findings showing that
abnormalities in the gut microbiota can be detected in patients with SLE, which
provides the rationale for greater investigation into whether microbiota-targeted
therapies could be used for the treatment/prevention of disease.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this meta-analysis was to estimate the association between
the FCGR2A rs1801274 polymorphism and the susceptibility to autoimmune diseases
more precisely.
METHODS: A meta-analysis was conducted on the association between the FCGR2A gene
variants and ADs by allelic contrast, homozygote contrast, the recessive model,
and the dominant model.
RESULTS: A total of 17 studies with 30 comparisons in different populations and
genotype-methods were available for this meta-analysis, including 10 Kawasaki
disease (KD), 7 Ulcerative colitis (UC), 6 Crohn's disease (CD), 3 Rheumatoid
arthritis (RA), 2 Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 1 Autoimmune thyroid
disease (ATD) and 1 diabetes mellitus type 1 (T1D). A significant association
between FCGR2A rs1801274 polymorphism were found in KD (OR = 1.409, P < 0.001)
and UC (OR = 1.237, P < 0.001). A overall meta-analysis increased risk of AD
significant association between FCGR2A rs1801274 gene polymorphism and ADs under 
allelic (OR = 1.378, P=0.000), homozygous (OR: 1.866, P=0.001), dominant (OR =
1.667, P = 0.000) and recessive (OR = 1.434, P=0.000) in Asian population.
Meanwhile, a decreased risk of AD was detected in the allelic (OR= 0.882, P =
0.011), homozygous (OR = 0.777, P = 0.013), dominant (OR = 0.850, P = 0.032) and 
recessive (OR = 0.840, P = 0.048) in African-American population.
CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis demonstrates that the FCGR2A rs1801274 G-allele
confers susceptibility to KD and UC. Data also suggests that the FCGR2A rs1801274
polymorphism may be associated with the susceptibility of multiple ADs in Asian
and African-American populations.

Why Are Omics Technologies Important to Understanding the Role of Nutrition in
Inflammatory Bowel Diseases?

For many years, there has been confusion about the role that nutrition plays in
inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). It is apparent that good dietary advice for
one individual may prove inappropriate for another. As with many diseases,
genome-wide association studies across large collaborative groups have been
important in revealing the role of genetics in IBD, with more than 200 genes
associated with susceptibility to the disease. These associations provide clues
to explain the differences in nutrient requirements among individuals. In
addition to genes directly involved in the control of inflammation, a number of
the associated genes play roles in modulating the gut microbiota. Cell line
models enable the generation of hypotheses as to how various bioactive dietary
components might be especially beneficial for certain genetic groups. Animal
models are necessary to mimic aspects of the complex aetiology of IBD, and
provide an important link between tissue culture studies and human trials. Once
we are sufficiently confident of our hypotheses, we can then take modified diets 
to an IBD population that is stratified according to genotype. Studies in IBD
patients fed a Mediterranean-style diet have been important in validating our
hypotheses and as a proof-of-principle for the application of these sensitive
omics technologies to aiding in the control of IBD symptoms.

IL-33 regulates the IgA-microbiota axis to restrain IL-1α-dependent colitis and
tumorigenesis.

Malik A, Sharma D, Zhu Q, Karki R, Guy CS, Vogel P, Kanneganti TD.

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) affect over 5 million individuals in the
industrialized world, with an increasing incidence rate worldwide. IBD also
predisposes affected individuals to development of colorectal cancer, which is a 
leading cause of cancer-related deaths in adults. Mutations in genes encoding
molecules in the IL-33 signaling pathway are associated with colitis and
colitis-associated cancer (CAC), but how IL-33 modulates gut homeostasis is
unclear. Here, we have shown that Il33-deficient mice are highly susceptible to
colitis and CAC. Mechanistically, we observed that IL-33 promoted IgA production 
from B cells, which is important for maintaining microbial homeostasis in the
intestine. Il33-deficient mice developed a dysbiotic microbiota that was
characterized by increased levels of mucolytic and colitogenic bacteria. In
response to chemically induced colitis, this microbial landscape promoted the
release of IL-1α, which acted as a critical driver of colitis and CAC.
Consequently, reconstitution of symbiotic microbiota or IL-1α ablation markedly
ameliorated colitis susceptibility in Il33-deficient animals. Our results
demonstrate that IL-33 promotes IgA production to maintain gut microbial
homoeostasis and restrain IL-1α-dependent colitis and CAC. This study therefore
highlights modulation of IL-33, IgA, IL-1α, and the microbiota as a potential
therapeutic approach in the treatment of IBD and CAC.

There is now growing evidence suggesting that Vitamin D is playing a critical
role in modulating the innate and adaptive immune responses. Several
polymorphisms have been identified in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene but their
association with ulcerative colitis (UC) susceptibility remained controversy. In 
the current study, we examined the association between VDR polymorphisms and
serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] with UC in Chinese Han population.
Polymorphisms of FokI (rs2228570)/BsmI (rs1544410)/ApaI (rs7975232)/TaqI
(rs731236) in the VDR gene were assessed in a case-control study comprising 404
UC patients and 612 controls. Moreover, 25(OH)D levels were measured by
electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay in 75 UC patients and 120 controls. Our
results suggested that BsmI polymorphism frequency was significantly lower in UC 
patients (P=0.028), and the frequency of AAC haplotype formed by BsmI, ApaI and
TaqI was also significantly lower in UC patients (P=0.012). Moreover, FokI
polymorphism was more frequently observed in patients with mild and moderate UC
as compared to those with severe UC (P=0.001, P<0.001, respectively). Average
25(OH)D level was lower in UC patients than in controls (19.3±6.8 vs.
21.8±7.3ng/mL, P=0.017), and was significantly correlated with hemoglobin
(β=0.49, P<0.001), C-reactive protein (β=-0.36, P<0.001), severity of UC
(β=-0.21, P=0.025) and FokI polymorphism (β=-0.20, P=0.031) in UC patients.
Interestingly, there was a significant correlation between FokI polymorphism and 
vitamin D deficiency (<20ng/mL) in UC patients (P=0.006). Together, these results
supported that VDR polymorphisms and 25(OH)D level were significantly correlated 
with UC risk and severity in Chinese Han population.

Proinflammatory cytokines are thought to modulate pathogeneses of various
inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), which
has been studied in various allergic diseases such as asthma, atopic dermatitis
(AD) and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), has been less considered to be involved 
in IBDs. However, mucosal dendritic cells (DCs) induced by various cytokines
including TSLP were reported to cause polarization of T cell toward Th2 response,
the differentiation of regulatory T-cell (Treg), and secretion of IgA by B cells.
In this review, we discuss the concept that decreased TSLP has the potential to
accelerate the development of Th1 response dominant diseases such as the Crohn's 
disease (CD) while increased TSLP has the potential to lead to a development of
Th2 cell dominant diseases such the ulcerative colitis (UC). To examine TSLP's
role as a potential determining factor for differentiating UC and CD, we analyzed
the effects of other genes regulated by TSLP in regards to the UC and CD
pathogeneses using data from online open access resources such as NetPath,
GeneMania, and the String database. Our findings indicate that TSLP is a key
mediator in the pathogenesis of IBDs and that further studies are needed to
evaluate its role.

Thiopurine-related hematotoxicity in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)
and inflammatory bowel diseases has been linked to genetically defined
variability in thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) activity. While gene testing
of TPMT is being clinically implemented, it is unclear if additional genetic
variation influences TPMT activity with consequences for thiopurine-related
toxicity. To examine this possibility, we performed a genome-wide association
study (GWAS) of red blood cell TPMT activity in 844 Estonian individuals and 245 
pediatric ALL cases. Additionally, we correlated genome-wide genotypes to human
hepatic TPMT activity in 123 samples. Only genetic variants mapping to chromosome
6, including the TPMT gene region, were significantly associated with TPMT
activity (P < 5.0 × 10-8 ) in each of the three GWAS and a joint meta-analysis of
1,212 cases (top hit P = 1.2 × 10-72 ). This finding is consistent with TPMT
genotype being the primary determinant of TPMT activity, reinforcing the
rationale for genetic testing of TPMT alleles in routine clinical practice to
individualize mercaptopurine dosage.

Intestinal microbiota are involved in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease,
ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis. We review the mechanisms by which these gut
bacteria, fungi, and viruses mediate mucosal homeostasis via their composite
genes (metagenome) and metabolic products (metabolome). We explain how
alterations to their profiles and functions under conditions of dysbiosis
contribute to inflammation and effector immune responses that mediate
inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in humans and enterocolitis in mice. It could
be possible to engineer the intestinal environment by modifying the microbiota
community structure or function to treat patients with IBD-either with individual
agents, via dietary management, or as adjuncts to immunosuppressive drugs. We
summarize the latest information on therapeutic use of fecal microbial
transplantation and propose improved strategies to selectively normalize the
dysbiotic microbiome in personalized approaches to treatment.

Autoimmune diseases (AIDs) are incurable but suppressible diseases whose
molecular mechanisms are yet to be elucidated. In this work, we selected five
systemic autoimmune diseases such as Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), Type 1 Diabetes
(T1D), Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), Autoimmune Thyroid Disease (ATD) and
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). Heterogeneous data such as miRNA,
transcription factor (TF), target genes and protein-protein interactions involved
in these AIDs were integrated to understand their roles at different functional
levels of miRNA such as transcription initiation, gene regulatory network
formation and post transcriptional regulation. To understand the functional
characteristics of these complex biological networks, they can be simplified as
network motifs (sub networks) and motif-motif interacting pairs (MMIs). The
network motif patterns and motif-motif interacting pairs that occur for the
selected five diseases were identified. To further understand the functional
association between AIDs, functions and pathways were determined using gene set
enrichment analysis and five selected immune signaling pathways (ISPs). The
crosstalk within AIDs and between the immune signaling pathways (ISPs) could
provide novel insights in deciphering disease mechanisms. This study represents
the first investigation of miRNA-TF regulatory network for AIDs and its
association with ISPs using sub-network motifs.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic, complex genetic disease with
rapidly increasing prevalence in China. The interactions of genetic,
environmental, and microbial factors contribute to the development of IBD,
however, the precise etiologies of IBD are not well understood yet.
Interleukin-23 receptor (IL-23R) encodes a subunit of receptor for IL-23, which
is an important proinflammatory cytokine. In this study, we investigated the
relationship between the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of IL-23R gene and 
IBD in Chinese Han population. We genotyped three nonsynonymous IL-23R SNPs with 
amino acid changes (rs11209026, p.Arg381Gln; rs41313262 p.Val362Ile and
rs11465797 p.Thr175Asn) in 198 patients with IBD (124 UC and 74 CD) and 100
healthy controls. The prevalence of the A allele in IL-23R Arg381Gln of CD
appeared less than controls, but it was not statistically significant (2.70% vs. 
6.00%, p > 0.05). There was no statistical difference between UC and controls
(5.65% vs. 6.00%, p = 0.91). The p.Val362Ile variant was present in 2.42% of UC
patients, in 2.70% of CD patients, which was similar in the control (2.00%).
There was no statistical difference among these three groups. We did not detect
Thr175Asn (rs11465797 c.524 C>A) in all the three groups. In conclusion, our
study demonstrated that the p.Val362Ile and Arg381Gln were not associated with
susceptibility to IBD in Chinese Han population.

Conjugates of fatty acids and amines, including endocannabinoids, are known to
play important roles as endogenous signaling molecules. Among these, the
ethanolamine conjugate of the n-3 poly unsaturated long chain fatty acid (PUFA)
docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) (DHA) was shown to possess strong
anti-inflammatory properties. Previously, we identified the serotonin conjugate
of DHA, docosahexaenoyl serotonin (DHA-5-HT), in intestinal tissues and showed
that its levels are markedly influenced by intake of n-3 PUFAs. However, its
biological roles remain to be elucidated. Here, we show that DHA-5-HT possesses
potent anti-inflammatory properties by attenuating the IL-23-IL-17 signaling
cascade in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages.
Transcriptome analysis revealed that DHA-5-HT down-regulates LPS-induced genes,
particularly those involved in generating a CD4+ Th17 response. Hence, levels of 
PGE2, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-23, all pivotal macrophage-produced mediators driving
the activation of pathogenic Th17 cells in a concerted way, were found to be
significantly suppressed by concentrations as low as 100-500nM DHA-5-HT.
Furthermore, DHA-5-HT inhibited the ability of RAW264.7 cells to migrate and
downregulated chemokines like MCP-1, CCL-20, and gene-expression of CCL-22 and of
several metalloproteinases. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) suggested
negative overlap with gene sets linked to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and
positive overlap with gene sets related to the Nrf2 pathway. The specific
formation of DHA-5-HT in the gut, combined with increasing data underlining the
importance of the IL-23-IL-17 signaling pathway in the etiology of many chronic
inflammatory diseases merits further investigation into its potential as
therapeutic compound in e.g. IBD or intestinal tumorigenesis.

BACKGROUND: Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is a first-line therapy in
pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) thought to induce remission through changes in the
gut microbiome. With microbiome assessment largely focused on microbial taxonomy 
and diversity, it remains unclear to what extent EEN induces functional changes
that thereby contribute to its therapeutic effect.
METHODS: Fecal samples were collected from 15 pediatric CD patients prior to and 
after EEN treatment, as well as from 5 healthy controls. Metagenomic data were
obtained via next-generation sequencing, and nonhuman reads were mapped to KEGG
pathways, where possible. Pathway abundance was compared between CD patients and 
controls, and between CD patients that sustained remission (SR) and those that
did not sustain remission (NSR).
RESULTS: Of 132 KEGG pathways identified, 8 pathways differed significantly
between baseline CD patients and controls. Examination of these eight pathways
showed SR patients had greater similarity to controls than NSR patients in all
cases. Pathways fell into one of three groups: 1) no prior connection to IBD, 2) 
previously reported connection to IBD, and 3) known roles in innate immunity and 
immunoregulation.
CONCLUSIONS: The microbiota of CD patients and controls represent alternative
ecological states that have broad differences in functional capabilities,
including xenobiotic and environmental pollutant degradation, succinate
metavolism, and bacterial HtpG, all of which can affect barrier integrity and
immune regulation. Moreover, our finding that SR patients were more similar to
healthy controls suggests that community microbial function, as inferred from
fecal microbiomes, could serve as a valuable diagnostic tool.

The first ever genome-wide association study (GWAS) of ulcerative colitis in
genetically distinct north Indian population identified two novel genes namely
CFB and SLC44A4. Considering their biological relevance, we investigated
allelic/genetic heterogeneity in these genes among ulcerative colitis cohorts of 
north Indian, Japanese and Dutch origin using high-density ImmunoChip
case-control genotype data. Comparative linkage disequilibrium profiling and test
of association were performed. Of the 28 CFB SNPs, similar strength of
association was observed for rs4151657 (novel ulcerative colitis GWAS SNP) in
north Indians (P=1.73 × 10-10) and Japanese (P=2.02 × 10-12) but not in the
Dutch. Further, a three-marker haplotype was shared between north Indians and
Japanese (P<10-8), but a different five-marker haplotype was associated (P=2.07 ×
10-6) in the Dutch. Of the 22 SLC44A4 SNPs, rs2736428 (novel ulcerative colitis
GWAS SNP) was found significantly associated in north Indians (P=4.94 × 10-10)
and Japanese (P=3.37 × 10-9), but not among the Dutch. These results suggest (i) 
apparent allelic heterogeneity in CFB and genetic heterogeneity in SLC44A4 across
different ethnic groups; (ii) shared ulcerative colitis genetic etiological
factors among Asians; and finally (iii) re-exploration of GWAS findings together 
with high-density genotyping/sequencing and trans-ethnic fine mapping approaches 
may help identify shared and population-specific risk variants and enable to
explain missing disease heritability.

BACKGROUND: Helicobacter bilis infection of C3H/HeN mice harboring the altered
Schaedler flora (ASF) triggers progressive immune responsiveness and the
development of colitis. We sought to investigate temporal alterations in
community structure of a defined (ASF-colonized) microbiota in normal and
inflamed murine intestines and to correlate microbiota changes to histopathologic
lesions.
METHODS: The colonic mucosal microbiota of healthy mice and ASF mice colonized
with H. bilis for 3, 6, or 12 weeks were investigated by fluorescence in situ
hybridization targeting the 16S ribosomal RNA genes of total bacteria,
group-specific organisms, and individual ASF bacterial species. Microbial
profiling of ASF and H. bilis abundance was performed on cecal contents.
RESULTS: Helicobacter bilis-colonized mice developed colitis associated with
temporal changes in composition and spatial distribution of the mucosal
microbiota. The number of total bacteria, ASF519, and helicobacter-positive
bacteria were increased (P < 0.05), whereas ASF360/361-positive bacteria were
decreased (P < 0.05) versus controls. Adherent biofilms in colitic mice were most
often (P < 0.05) composed of total bacteria, ASF457, and H. bilis. Total numbers 
of ASF519 and H. bilis bacteria were positively correlated (P = 0.03, r = 0.39
and P < 0.0001, r = 0.73), and total numbers of ASF360/361 bacteria were
negatively correlated (P = 0.003, r = -0.53) to histopathologic score.
Differences in cecal abundance of ASF members were not observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Altered community structure with murine colitis is characterized by 
distinct ASF bacteria that interact with the colonic mucosa, by formation of an
isolating interlaced layer, by attachment, or by invasion, and this interaction
is differentially expressed over time.

BACKGROUND: Currently, 200 genetic risk loci have been identified for
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although these findings have significantly
advanced our insight into IBD biology, there has been little progress in
translating this knowledge toward clinical practice, like more cost-efficient
drug development. Our aim was to use genetic knowledge to identify drugs that
warrant further investigation in IBD treatment.
METHODS: We hypothesized that proteins encoded by IBD candidate genes are
potential IBD drug targets because genetic information can increase successful
drug identification. We identified drugs that target the proteins encoded by IBD 
candidate genes using the DrugBank. We included proteins that are in direct
protein-protein interaction with proteins encoded by IBD risk genes. Promising
potential IBD drugs were selected based on a manual literature search of all
identified drugs (PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov).
RESULTS: We have identified 113 drugs that could potentially be used in IBD
treatment. Fourteen are known IBD drugs, 48 drugs have been, or are being
investigated in IBD, 19 are being used or being investigated in other
inflammatory disorders treatment, and 32 are investigational new drugs that have 
not yet been registered for clinical use.
CONCLUSIONS: We confirm that proteins encoded by IBD candidate genes are targeted
by approved IBD therapies. Furthermore, we show that Food and Drug
Administration-approved drugs could possibly be repositioned for IBD treatment.
We also identify investigational new drugs that warrant further investigation for
IBD treatment. Incorporating this process in IBD drug development will improve
the utilization of genetic data and could lead to the improvement of IBD
treatment.

PURPOSE: Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a heterogeneous disorder
caused by multiple factors. Although genetic and immunological analyses are
required for a definitive diagnosis, no reports of a comprehensive genetic study 
of a Japanese population are available.
METHODS: In total, 35 Japanese patients <16 years of age suffering from IBD,
including 27 patients aged <6 years with very early-onset IBD, were enrolled in
this multicenter study. Exome and targeted gene panel sequencing was performed
for all patients. Mutations in genes responsible for primary immunodeficiency
diseases (PID) and clinical and immunological parameters were evaluated according
to disease type.
RESULTS: We identified monogenic mutations in 5 of the 35 patients (14.3 %). We
identified compound heterozygous and homozygous splice-site mutations in
interleukin-10 receptor A (IL-10RA) in two patients, nonsense mutations in
X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) in two patients, and a missense
mutation in cytochrome b beta chain in one patient. Using assays for protein
expression levels, IL-10 signaling, and cytokine production, we confirmed that
the mutations resulted in loss of function. For each patient, genotype was
significantly associated with clinical findings. We successfully treated a
patient with a XIAP mutation by allogeneic cord blood hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation, and his symptoms were ameliorated completely.
CONCLUSIONS: Targeted sequencing and immunological analysis are useful for
screening monogenic disorders and selecting curative therapies in pediatric
patients with IBD. The genes responsible for PID are frequently involved in
pediatric IBD and play critical roles in normal immune homeostasis in the
gastrointestinal tract.

BACKGROUND: This study examines the dual role of Escherichia coli in the course
of ulcerative colitis (UC). The intestinal microbiota is considered to play an
important role in UC pathogenesis, but how E. coli contributes to inflammation in
UC is still unknown. On the one hand, we demonstrated that there was a
significant increase in the number of E. coli at the sites of inflammation in
patients with UC, which can lead to immune system activation, whilst, on the
other hand, E. coli may contribute to the resolution of inflammatory reactions
since E. coli can inhibit hydroxyl radical formation by eliminating substrates of
the Fenton reaction, by assimilating ferrous iron (Fe2+) and inducing the
decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). On this way, E. coli may affect the
initiation and/or prolongation of remission stages of UC.
METHODS: Ten E. coli strains were isolated from the colonic mucosa of patients in
the acute phase of UC. Using PCR, we examined the presence of genes encoding
catalases (katG and katE) and proteins participating in iron acquisition (feoB,
fepA, fhuA, fecA, iroN, fyuA, and iutA) in these E. coli strains. To determine if
iron ions influence the growth rate of E. coli and its ability to decompose H2O2,
we grew E. coli in defined culture media without iron (M9(-)) or with ferrous
ions (M9(Fe2+)). Expression levels of genes encoding catalases were examined by
real-time PCR.
RESULTS: All investigated E. coli strains had catalase genes (katG, katE), genes 
coding for receptors for Fe2+ (feoB) and at least one of the genes responsible
for iron acquisition related to siderophores (fepA, fhuA, fecA, iroN, fyuA,
iutA). E. coli cultured in M9(Fe2+) grew faster than E. coli in M9(-). The
presence of Fe2+ in the media contributed to the increased rate of H2O2
decomposition by E. coli and induced katG gene expression.
CONCLUSIONS: E. coli eliminates substrates of the Fenton reaction by assimilating
Fe2+ and biosynthesizing enzymes that catalyze H2O2 decomposition. Thus, E. coli 
can inhibit hydroxyl radical formation, and affects the initiation and/or
prolongation of remission stages of UC.

BACKGROUND: Given the lack of a complete and comprehensive library of microbial
reference genomes, determining the functional profile of diverse microbial
communities is challenging. The available functional analysis pipelines lack
several key features: (i) an integrated alignment tool, (ii) operon-level
analysis, and (iii) the ability to process large datasets.
RESULTS: Here we introduce our open-sourced, stand-alone functional analysis
pipeline for analyzing whole metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing data, 
FMAP (Functional Mapping and Analysis Pipeline). FMAP performs alignment, gene
family abundance calculations, and statistical analysis (three levels of analyses
are provided: differentially-abundant genes, operons and pathways). The resulting
output can be easily visualized with heatmaps and functional pathway diagrams.
FMAP functional predictions are consistent with currently available functional
analysis pipelines.
CONCLUSION: FMAP is a comprehensive tool for providing functional analysis of
metagenomic/metatranscriptomic sequencing data. With the added features of
integrated alignment, operon-level analysis, and the ability to process large
datasets, FMAP will be a valuable addition to the currently available functional 
analysis toolbox. We believe that this software will be of great value to the
wider biology and bioinformatics communities.

BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including Crohn's disease (CD)
and ulcerative colitis (UC), are multifactorial disorders that result from a
dysregulated inflammatory response to environmental factors in genetically
predisposed individuals. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to be
involved in the development of IBDs.
AIMS: We investigated common variants in five miRNA genes in a cohort of Italian 
IBD patients, to evaluate their possible role in the disease's susceptibility and
phenotype manifestations.
METHODS: The analysis included 267 CD patients, 207 UC patients, and 298 matched 
healthy controls. Polymorphisms in the MIR122, MIR499, MIR146A, MIR196A2, and
MIR124A genes were evaluated by allelic discrimination assay.
RESULTS: We did not find associations between mir polymorphisms and IBD
susceptibility. In both diseases, rs17669 and rs11614913 (MIR122 and MIR196A2)
seem to contribute to clinical phenotypes: ileal location in CD (odds ratio [OR] 
= 1.82, p = 0.03; OR = 0.51, p = 0.01), and left-sided extent in UC (OR = 0.43, p
= 0.05; OR = 0.28, p = 0.002). In CD, the MIR124A polymorphism (rs531564)
contributed to colon location (p = 0.03, OR = 2.74). Finally, the variant allele 
of rs11614913 was associated with early age at onset in both diseases (p = 0.05
and p = 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: We showed for the first time that polymorphisms in MIR122, MIR196A2,
and MIR124A could play a role in clinical phenotype modulation in IBD.

Patient-derived cell lines and animal models have proven invaluable for the
understanding of human intestinal diseases and for drug development although both
inherently comprise disadvantages and caveats. Many genetically determined
intestinal diseases occur in specific tissue microenvironments that are not
adequately modeled by monolayer cell culture. Likewise, animal models
incompletely recapitulate the complex pathologies of intestinal diseases of
humans and fall short in predicting the effects of candidate drugs.
Patient-derived stem cell organoids are new and effective models for the
development of novel targeted therapies. With the use of intestinal organoids
from patients with inherited diseases, the potency and toxicity of drug
candidates can be evaluated better. Moreover, owing to the novel clustered
regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein-9
genome-editing technologies, researchers can use organoids to precisely modulate 
human genetic status and identify pathogenesis-related genes of intestinal
diseases. Therefore, here we discuss how patient-derived organoids should be
grown and how advanced genome-editing tools may be applied to research on
modeling of cancer and infectious diseases. We also highlight practical
applications of organoids ranging from basic studies to drug screening and
precision medicine.

Understanding the regulation of pattern recognition receptors in inflammatory
diseases - a 'Nod' in the right direction.

Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) -like receptors (NLRs) are a
family of 23 receptors known as pattern recognition receptors; they are expressed
in many cell types and play a key role in the innate immune response. The NLRs
are activated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns, which include
structurally conserved molecules present on the surfaces of bacteria. The
activation of these NLRs by pathogens results in the downstream activation of
signalling kinases and transcription factors, culminating in the transcription of
genes coding for pro-inflammatory factors. Expression of NLR is altered in many
cellular, physiological and disease states. There is a lack of understanding of
the mechanisms by which NLR expression is regulated, particularly in chronic
inflammatory states. Genetic polymorphisms and protein interactions are included 
in such mechanisms. This review seeks to examine the current knowledge regarding 
the regulation of this family of receptors and their signalling pathways as well 
as how their expression changes in disease states with particular focus on NOD1
and NOD2 in inflammatory bowel diseases among others.

The aim of our study was to assess the utility of next generation sequencing
(NGS) for predicting toxicity and clinical response to thiopurine drugs in
paediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Exome data for 100 patients 
were assessed against biochemically measured TPMT enzyme activity, clinical
response and adverse effects. The TPMT gene and a panel of 15 other genes
implicated in thiopurine toxicity were analysed using a gene based statistical
test (SKAT-O test). Nine patients out of 100 (Crohn's disease- 67, ulcerative
colitis- 23 and IBDU-10) had known TPMT mutations associated with deficient
enzyme activity. A novel and a highly pathogenic TPMT variant not detectable
through standard genotyping, was identified through NGS in an individual
intolerant to thiopurines. Of the 14 patients intolerant to thiopurines, NGS
identified deleterious TPMT variants in 5 individuals whereas the biochemical
test identified 8 individuals as intolerant (sensitivity 35.7% and 57.14%;
specificity 93.75% and 50% respectively). SKAT-O test identified a significant
association between MOCOS gene and TPMT activity (p = 0.0015), not previously
reported. Although NGS has the ability to detect rare or novel variants not
otherwise identified through standard genotyping, it demonstrates no clear
advantage over the biochemical test in predicting toxicity in our modest cohort.

Backgrounds and Aims: The effect of cigarette smoking [CS] is ambivalent since
smoking improves ulcerative colitis [UC] while it worsens Crohn's disease [CD].
Although this clinical relationship between inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] and 
tobacco is well established, only a few experimental works have investigated the 
effect of smoking on the colonic barrier homeostasis focusing on xenobiotic
detoxification genes.
Methods: A comprehensive and integrated comparative analysis of the global
xenobiotic detoxification capacity of the normal colonic mucosa of healthy
smokers [n = 8] and non-smokers [n = 9] versus the non-affected colonic mucosa of
UC patients [n = 19] was performed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain
reaction [qRT PCR]. The detoxification gene expression profile was analysed in CD
patients [n = 18], in smoking UC patients [n = 5], and in biopsies from
non-smoking UC patients cultured or not with cigarette smoke extract [n = 8].
Results: Of the 244 detoxification genes investigated, 65 were dysregulated in UC
patients in comparison with healthy controls or CD patients. The expression of ≥ 
45/65 genes was inversed by CS in biopsies of smoking UC patients in remission
and in colonic explants of UC patients exposed to cigarette smoke extract. We
devised a network-based data analysis approach for differentially assessing
changes in genetic interactions, allowing identification of unexpected regulatory
detoxification genes that may play a major role in the beneficial effect of
smoking on UC.
Conclusions: Non-inflamed colonic mucosa in UC is characterised by a specifically
altered detoxification gene network, which is partially restored by tobacco.
These mucosal signatures could be useful for developing new therapeutic
strategies and biomarkers of drug response in UC.

BACKGROUND: Paneth cell dysfunction has been implicated in a subset of Crohn's
disease (CD) patients. We previously stratified clinical outcomes of CD patients 
by using Paneth cell phenotypes, which we defined by the intracellular
distribution of antimicrobial proteins. Animal studies suggest that Paneth cells 
shape the intestinal microbiome. However, it is unclear whether Paneth cell
phenotypes alter the microbiome complexity in CD subjects. Therefore, we analyzed
the correlation of Paneth cell phenotypes with mucosal microbiome composition and
ileal RNA expression in pediatric CD and noninflammatory bowel disease (non-IBD) 
patients.
METHODS: Pediatric CD (n = 44) and non-IBD (n = 62) patients aged 4 to 18 were
recruited prior to routine endoscopic biopsy. Ileal mucosal samples were analyzed
for Paneth cell phenotypes, mucosal microbiome composition, and RNA
transcriptome.
RESULTS: The prevalence of abnormal Paneth cells was higher in pediatric versus
adult CD cohorts. For pediatric CD patients, those with abnormal Paneth cells
showed significant changes in their ileal mucosal microbiome, highlighted by
reduced protective microbes and enriched proinflammatory microbes. Ileal
transcriptome profiles showed reduced transcripts for genes that control
oxidative phosphorylation in CD patients with abnormal Paneth cells. These
transcriptional changes in turn were correlated with specific microbiome
alterations. In non-IBD patients, a subset contained abnormal Paneth cells.
However, this subset was not associated with alterations in the microbiome or
host transcriptome.
CONCLUSION: Paneth cell abnormalities in human subjects are associated with
mucosal dysbiosis in the context of CD, and these changes are associated with

Objective To perform a meta-analysis to evaluate studies investigating the
association between ATG16L1 gene polymorphism and Crohn's disease. Methods
PubMed, Embase and Web of Science databases were searched for all studies
focusing on the association of ATG16L1 and Crohn's disease. Combined odds ratios 
with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for four genetic models (allelic
model: G allele versus A allele; additive model: GG versus AA; dominant model:
GA + GG versus AA; recessive model: GG versus GA + AA) using either a random
effects or fixed effects model. Results A total of 47 case-control studies
involving 18 638 cases and 30 181 controls were included in the final
meta-analysis. There was a significant association between ATG16L1 and Crohn's
disease for all four genetic models. Significant associations were also shown in 
subgroup analyses when stratified by study design (population- or
hospital-based). Conclusion In this meta-analysis, the ATG16L1 genotype was
significantly associated with the risk of developing Crohn's disease.

Fusobacterium nucleatum has been associated with both periodontal disease and
inflammatory bowel disease. This Gram-negative bacterium possesses a high
inflammatory potential that may contribute to the disease process. We
hypothesized that green and black tea polyphenols attenuate the inflammatory
response of monocytes/macrophages mediated by F. nucleatum. We first showed that 
the tea extracts, EGCG and theaflavins reduce the NF-κB activation induced by F. 
nucleatum in monocytes. Since NF-κB is a key regulator of genes coding for
inflammatory mediators, we tested the effects of tea polyphenols on secretion of 
IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and CXCL8 by macrophages. A pre-treatment of macrophages with
the tea extracts, EGCG, or theaflavins prior to a stimulation with F. nucleatum
significantly inhibited the secretion of all four cytokines and reduced the
secretion of MMP-3 and MMP-9, two tissue destructive enzymes. TREM-1 expressed by
macrophages is a cell-surface receptor involved in the propagation of the
inflammatory response to bacterial challenges. Interestingly, tea polyphenols
inhibited the secretion/shedding of soluble TREM-1 induced by a stimulation of
macrophages with F. nucleatum. The anti-inflammatory properties of tea
polyphenols identified in the present study suggested that they may be promising 
agents for the prevention and/or treatment of periodontal disease and
inflammatory bowel disease.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been reported as an important inducer of
colorectal cancer (CRC). The most malignant IBD-associated CRC type has been
highlighted as colitis-associated cancer (CAC). However, lack of CAC cases and
difficulties of the long follow-up research have challenged researchers in
molecular mechanism probing. Here, we established pre-CAC mouse models (dextran
sulfate sodium [DSS] group and azoxymethane [AOM] group) and CAC mouse model
(DSS/AOM group) to mimic human CAC development through singly or combinational
treatment with DSS and AOM followed by disease activity index analysis. We found 
that these CAC mice showed much more severe disease phenotype, including serious 
diarrhea, body weight loss, rectal prolapse and bleeding, bloody stool, tumor
burden, and bad survival. By detecting expression patterns of several therapeutic
targets-Apc, p53, Kras, and TNF-α-in these mouse models through western blot,
histology analysis, qRT-PCR, and ELISA methods, we found that the oncogene Kras
expression remained unchanged, while the tumor suppressors-Apc and p53 expression
were both significantly downregulated with malignancy progression from pre-CAC to
CAC, and TNF-α level was elevated the most in CAC mice blood which is of
potential clinical use. These data indicated the successful establishment of CAC 
development mouse models, which mimics human CAC well both in disease phenotype
and molecular level, and highlighted the promoting role of inflammation in CAC
progression. This useful tool will facilitate the further study in CAC molecular 
mechanism.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) ulcerative colitis (UC) 
and Crohn's disease (CD) cause significant morbidity and are increasing in
prevalence among all populations, including African Americans. More than 200
susceptibility loci have been identified in populations of predominantly European
ancestry, but few loci have been associated with IBD in other ethnicities.
METHODS: We performed 2 high-density, genome-wide scans comprising 2345 cases of 
African Americans with IBD (1646 with CD, 583 with UC, and 116 inflammatory bowel
disease unclassified) and 5002 individuals without IBD (controls, identified from
the Health Retirement Study and Kaiser Permanente database). Single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) associated at P < 5.0 × 10-8 in meta-analysis with a nominal
evidence (P < .05) in each scan were considered to have genome-wide significance.
RESULTS: We detected SNPs at HLA-DRB1, and African-specific SNPs at ZNF649 and
LSAMP, with associations of genome-wide significance for UC. We detected SNPs
at USP25 with associations of genome-wide significance for IBD. No associations
of genome-wide significance were detected for CD. In addition, 9 genes previously
associated with IBD contained SNPs with significant evidence for replication (P <
1.6 × 10-6): ADCY3, CXCR6, HLA-DRB1 to HLA-DQA1 (genome-wide significance on
conditioning), IL12B,PTGER4, and TNC for IBD; IL23R, PTGER4, and SNX20 (in strong
linkage disequilibrium with NOD2) for CD; and KCNQ2 (near TNFRSF6B) for UC.
Several of these genes, such as TNC (near TNFSF15), CXCR6, and genes associated
with IBD at the HLA locus, contained SNPs with unique association patterns with
African-specific alleles.
CONCLUSIONS: We performed a genome-wide association study of African Americans
with IBD and identified loci associated with UC in only this population; we also 
replicated IBD, CD, and UC loci identified in European populations. The detection
of variants associated with IBD risk in only people of African descent
demonstrates the importance of studying the genetics of IBD and other complex
diseases in populations beyond those of European ancestry.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The mucus layer of the intestinal tract is the main barrier 
between luminal microbes and the mucosa, and has an essential role in the body
defense mechanisms. Previous research could not establish consistent results for 
mucin genes expression in Crohn's disease (CD) patients. In this meta-analysis we
looked at the mucin expression in CD patients and compared it with healthy
controls.
METHOD: English medical literature searches were conducted for mucin expression
in the mucosa of the ileum and colon of CD patients and compared it with normal
mucosa. Case-control studies were included. Meta-analysis was performed by using 
Comprehensive meta-anaslysis software. Pooled odds ratios and 95% confidence
intervals were calculated.
RESULTS: We found 160 eligible studies. Twenty studies were rejected because they
have been performed in animals or did not have full text, and 134 studies were
excluded because of language, being editorials, review articles, or because of
duplications. We were left with 6 case-control studies from 4 countries that
fulfilled the inclusion criteria, published till 31.12.2015. No significant
heterogeneity was demonstrated: Q = 149.256, df (Q) = 40.00, I2= 73.2% (less than
75%). We found a decrease of 34% in the total mucin expression in CD patients
(Odds Ratio 0.660, 95% CI 0.486-0.897, P = 0.008). We also found a significantly 
decreased expression in CD patients for MUC5AC, MUC5B and MUC7.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrated a global decrease in mucin expression in CD patients 
when compared with healthy controls.

There is rising incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in
India topping the Southeast Asian (SEA) countries. The common genes implicated in
disease pathogenesis in the West are not causal in Indian patients and the role
of "hygiene hypothesis" is unclear. There appears to be a North-South divide with
more ulcerative colitis (UC) in north and Crohn's disease (CD) in south India.
IBD in second generation Indian migrants to the West takes the early onset and
more severe form of the West whereas it retains the nature of its country of
origin in migrants to SEA countries. The clinical presentation is much like other
SEA countries (similar age and sex profile, low positive family history and
effect of smoking, roughly similar disease location, use of aminosalicylates for 
CD, low use of biologics and similar surgical rates) with some differences
(higher incidence of inflammatory CD, lower perianal disease, higher use of
aminosalicylates and azathioprine and lower current use of corticosteroids). UC
presents more with extensive disease not paralleled in severity clinically or
histologically, follows benign course with easy medical control and low incidence
of fulminant disease, cancer, complications, and surgery. UC related colorectal
cancer develop in an unpredictable manner with respect to disease duration and
site questioning the validity of strict screening protocol. About a third of CD
patients get antituberculosis drugs and a significant number presents with small 
intestinal bleed which is predominantly afflicted by aggressive inflammation.
Biomarkers have inadequate diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for both.
Pediatric IBD tends to be more severe than adult. Population based studies are
needed to address the lacunae in epidemiology and definition of etiological
factors. Newer biomarkers and advanced diagnostic techniques (in the field of
gastrointestinal endoscopy, molecular pathology and genetics) needs to be
developed for proper disease definition and treatment.

We present a sensitive approach to predict genes expressed selectively in
specific cell types, by searching publicly available expression data for genes
with a similar expression profile to known cell-specific markers. Our method,
CellMapper, strongly outperforms previous computational algorithms to predict
cell type-specific expression, especially for rare and difficult-to-isolate cell 
types. Furthermore, CellMapper makes accurate predictions for human brain cell
types that have never been isolated, and can be rapidly applied to diverse cell
types from many tissues. We demonstrate a clinically relevant application to
prioritize candidate genes in disease susceptibility loci identified by GWAS.

We provide a comprehensive field synopsis of genetic and epigenetic associations 
for paediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). A systematic review was
performed and included 84 genetic association studies reporting data for 183
polymorphisms in 71 genes. Meta-analyses were conducted for 20 SNPs in 10 genes
of paediatric Crohn's disease (CD) and for 8 SNPs in 5 genes of paediatric
ulcerative colitis (UC). Five epigenetic studies were also included, but formal
meta-analysis was not possible. Venice criteria and Bayesian false discovery
probability test were applied to assess the credibility of associations. Nine
SNPs in 4 genes were considered to have highly credible associations with
paediatric CD, of which four variants (rs2066847, rs12521868, rs26313667,
rs1800629) were not previously identified in paediatric GWAS. Differential DNA
methylation in NOD2 and TNF-α, dysregulated expression in let-7 and miR-124 were 
associated with paediatric IBD, but not as yet replicated. Highly credible SNPs
associated with paediatric IBD have also been implicated in adult IBD, with
similar magnitudes of associations. Early onset and distinct phenotypic features 
of paediatric IBD might be due to distinct epigenetic changes, but these findings
need to be replicated. Further progress identifying genetic and epigenetic
susceptibility of paediatric IBD will require international collaboration,
population diversity and harmonization of protocols.

GWAS have linked SNPs to risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but a
systematic characterization of disease-associated genes has been lacking. Prior
studies utilized microarrays that did not capture many genes encoded within risk 
loci or defined expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) using peripheral
blood, which is not the target tissue in IBD. To address these gaps, we sought to
characterize the expression of IBD-associated risk genes in disease-relevant
tissues and in the setting of active IBD. Terminal ileal (TI) and colonic mucosal
tissues were obtained from patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis
and from healthy controls. We developed a NanoString code set to profile 678
genes within IBD risk loci. A subset of patients and controls were genotyped for 
IBD-associated risk SNPs. Analyses included differential expression and variance 
analysis, weighted gene coexpression network analysis, and eQTL analysis. We
identified 116 genes that discriminate between healthy TI and colon samples and
uncovered patterns in variance of gene expression that highlight heterogeneity of
disease. We identified 107 coexpressed gene pairs for which transcriptional
regulation is either conserved or reversed in an inflammation-independent or
-dependent manner. We demonstrate that on average approximately 60% of
disease-associated genes are differentially expressed in inflamed tissue. Last,
we identified eQTLs with either genotype-only effects on expression or an
interaction effect between genotype and inflammation. Our data reinforce tissue
specificity of expression in disease-associated candidate genes, highlight genes 
and gene pairs that are regulated in disease-relevant tissue and inflammation,
and provide a foundation to advance the understanding of IBD pathogenesis.

JAK2 genetic variants are associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and
JAK inhibitors are being evaluated for therapy targeting immune-mediated
diseases, including IBD. As JAK pathway-mediated cytokine regulation varies
across cell types and stimulation conditions, we examined how JAK signaling and
IBD-associated JAK2 variants regulate distinct acute and chronic microbial
product exposure outcomes in human myeloid cells, consistent with the conditions 
of initial entry and ongoing intestinal tissue residence, respectively.
Macrophages from controls and ulcerative colitis patients carrying the IBD-risk
rs10758669 CC genotype showed increased JAK2 expression and nucleotide-binding
oligomerization domain 2-induced JAK2 phosphorylation relative to AA carriers.
Interestingly, the threshold of JAK2 expression and signaling determined
pattern-recognition receptor (PRR)-induced outcomes; whereas anti-inflammatory
cytokines progressively decreased with lower JAK2 expression, proinflammatory
cytokines switched from decreased to increased secretion below a certain JAK2
expression threshold. Low JAK2-expressing rs10758669 AA macrophages were above
this threshold; consequently, both PRR-induced pro- and anti-inflammatory
cytokines were decreased. However, relative to rs10758669 CC risk carriers, AA
carrier macrophages switched to increased nucleotide-binding oligomerization
domain 2-induced proinflammatory cytokines at lower therapeutically used JAK
inhibitor doses. Importantly, JAK inhibitors increased proinflammatory cytokines 
secreted by peripheral macrophages following chronic PRR stimulation and by human
intestinal myeloid cells following exposure to intestinal pathogens.
Mechanistically, the decreased response to and secretion of autocrine/paracrine
IL-10, IL-4, IL-22 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin regulated these JAK-dependent
outcomes in myeloid cells. Taken together, the JAK signaling threshold determines
whether PRR-induced pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines are reciprocally
regulated in myeloid cells; consideration of JAK2 genotype and targeting of
specific cell types might improve JAK-targeted therapy in immune-mediated
diseases.

Programmed death 1 (PD-1) and its ligands, namely PD-L1 and PD-L2, are one of the
key factors responsible for inhibitory T cell signaling, mediating the mechanisms
of tolerance and providing immune homeostasis. Mounting evidence demonstrates
that impaired PD-1:PD-L function plays an important role in a variety of
autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes (T1D), encephalomyelitis,
inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), autoimmune
hepatitis (AIH), Behcet's disease (BD), myasthenia gravis (MG), autoimmune
uveitis (AU), Sjögren's syndrome (SjS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE),
systemic sclerosis (SSc), myocarditis, and ankylosing spondylitis (AS). By
investigating the candidate genes, genome-wide association studies, and
identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PD-1 gene in humans, 
it has been shown that there is a higher risk in relevant genetic associations
with developing autoimmune diseases in certain ethnic groups. In this review we
have tried to present a comprehensive role of PD-1:PD-L in all recently studied
autoimmune diseases.

BACKGROUND: We previously showed that zonula occludens toxin (Zot) encoded by
Campylobacter concisus zot (808T) gene has the potential to initiate inflammatory
bowel disease. This Zot protein caused prolonged intestinal epithelial barrier
damage, induced intestinal epithelial and macrophage production of tumor necrosis
factor-α and enhanced the responses of macrophages to other microbes. In order to
understand the potential virulence of Zot proteins in other Campylobacter
species, in this study we examined their presence, similarities, motifs and
prophages.
METHODS: The presence of Zot proteins in Campylobacter species was examined by
searching for the Zot family domain in multiple protein databases. Walker A and
Walker B motifs in Zot proteins were identified using protein sequence alignment.
A phylogenetic tree based on Campylobacter zot genes was constructed using
maximum-likelihood method. Campylobacter Zot proteins were compared using protein
sequence alignment. The zot-containing prophages in Campylobacter species were
identified and compared with known prophage proteins and other viral proteins
using protein sequence alignment and protein BLAST.
RESULTS: Twelve Zot proteins were found in nine Campylobacter species/subspecies.
Among these Campylobacter species, three species had two Zot proteins and the
remaining six species/subspecies had one Zot protein. Walker A and Walker B
motifs and a transmembrane domain were found in all identified Campylobacter Zot 
proteins. The twelve Campylobacter zot genes from the nine Campylobacter
species/subspecies formed two clusters. The ZotCampyType_1 proteins encoded by
Cluster 1 Campylobacter zot genes showed high similarities to each other.
However, ZotCampyType_2 proteins encoded by Cluster 2 Campylobacter zot genes
were more diverse. Furthermore, the zot-containing Campylobacter prophages were
identified.
CONCLUSION: This study reports the identification of two types of Campylobacter
Zot proteins. The high similarities of ZotCampyType_1 proteins suggest that they 
are likely to have similar virulence. ZotCampyType_2 proteins are less similar to
each other and their virulent properties, if any, remain to be examined
individually.

Chronic systemic inflammation (CSI) has recently been identified as a major
contributor to common diseases ranging from cancer to metabolic disorders and
neurologic alterations. In the last decade, we and others have generated
genetically engineered mouse models for inflammatory diseases, which enable
studying the molecular mechanisms of CSI. Recently, organ cross-talk induced by
CSI under homeostatic and pathological conditions has begun to be appreciated. In
this review, we will revisit whole organism physiology in relation to CSI
originating from epithelial tissues, such as the skin and gut. Furthermore, we
will discuss the current knowledge regarding the mechanisms, the specific immune 
cells and molecules responsible for inducing the most common comorbidities, such 
as cardiovascular, metabolic, and neurological complications, as well as bone
loss, in heterogeneous diseases like psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and
inflammatory bowel disease. As it would be impossible to discuss all
comorbidities of these diseases as well as all epithelial tissues, we present an 
overview with a special emphasis on our recent findings linking skin inflammation
to bone loss.

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a highly heritable disease for which there is a
great unmet need for improved therapies. Genetics research has identified several
major pathways involved in the disease, from which treatments have either now
entered clinical practice or are in development. In particular, therapies
targeting the IL-23 pathway were repositioned for use in AS following the
discovery of multiple genes in the pathway as determinants of AS risk. Discovery 
of the association of aminopeptidase genes with AS, and subsequently with
psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease and other conditions, has triggered
research into therapies targeting this pathway. The AS-genetic associations point
to involvement of gut mucosal immunity in driving disease, and metagenomic
studies have provided strong support that AS is a disease driven by interaction
between the gut microbiome and host immune system, providing a rationale for the 
exploration of gut-targeted therapies for the disease.

Osteoporosis is more frequent in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. A
reduction in bone mineral mass in these individuals is caused not only by
inflammatory processes in the bowel, because osteoporosis occurs already in very 
young IBD patients and in newly diagnosed individuals who have not yet undergone 
any pharmacological treatment. One of individual determinants of the bone
turnover parameters is osteoprotegerin (OPG) encoded by the TNFRSF11B gene. The
c.-223C > T polymorphism in this gene has been extensively studied in
post-menopausal osteoporosis patients. However, no such studies exist for
osteoporosis related to IBD. The aim of our study was to determine whether the
c.-223C > T (rs2073617) polymorphism in the 5'UTR region of the gene encoding
osteoprotegerin is a functional polymorphism which may change the gene expression
and resulting OPG levels, and so be associated with osteopenia and osteoporosis, 
and impaired bone metabolism in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients. 
Our study included 198 IBD patients and 41 healthy controls. Lumbar spine and
femoral neck bone mineral density, T-score, Z-score as well as OPG, RANKL,
vitamin D, calcium and interleukin 4 and 10 concentrations were determined for
all study subjects. Genotyping of the TNFRSF11B polymorphic site was performed by
restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. Statistical analyses were
conducted using Statistica software. Odds ratios, 95 % confidence intervals, and 
P values were calculated using the HWE calculator. Our results did not allow
determining an unequivocal association between the polymorphic variants of the
TNFRSF11B 5'UTR region and a susceptibility to osteoporosis in IBD patients. We
have shown, however, that the c.-223T allele was twice as more frequent in
Crohn's disease (CD) patients than among controls (OR = 1.99, P value = 0.009).
Interestingly, average osteoprotegerin levels in CD patients did not
significantly differ from those in controls, whereas in ulcerative colitis
patients, OPG levels were significantly lower. We have concluded that low OPG
levels may be associated with osteoporosis in ulcerative colitis, but it is not
correlated with the c.-223C > T polymorphism in the TNFRSF11B gene. In CD
patients, in turn, we observed increased RANKL levels. Our observations confirm
different pathogeneses of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis as well as
different molecular backgrounds of osteoporosis associated with these two
diseases.

Pathway analysis has become popular as a secondary analysis strategy for
genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Most of the current pathway analysis
methods aggregate signals from the main effects of single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes within a pathway without considering the effects of
gene-gene interactions. However, gene-gene interactions can also have critical
effects on complex diseases. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks have been
used to define gene pairs for the gene-gene interaction tests. Incorporating the 
PPI information to define gene pairs for interaction tests within pathways can
increase the power for pathway-based association tests. We propose a pathway
association test, which aggregates the interaction signals in PPI networks within
a pathway, for GWAS with case-control samples. Gene size is properly considered
in the test so that genes do not contribute more to the test statistic simply due
to their size. Simulation studies were performed to verify that the method is a
valid test and can have more power than other pathway association tests in the
presence of gene-gene interactions within a pathway under different scenarios. We
applied the test to the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium GWAS datasets for 
seven common diseases. The most significant pathway is the chaperones modulate
interferon signaling pathway for Crohn's disease (p-value = 0.0003). The pathway 
modulates interferon gamma, which induces the JAK/STAT pathway that is involved
in Crohn's disease. Several other pathways that have functional implications for 
the seven diseases were also identified. The proposed test based on gene-gene
interaction signals in PPI networks can be used as a complementary tool to the
current existing pathway analysis methods focusing on main effects of genes. An
efficient software implementing the method is freely available at
http://puppi.sourceforge.net.

BACKGROUND: The last 50-100 years has been marked by a sharp rise in so-called
"Western-diseases" in those countries that have experienced major industrial
advances and shifts towards urbanized living. These diseases include obesity,
type 2 diabetes, inflammatory bowel diseases, and food allergies in which chronic
dysregulation of metabolic and/or immune processes appear to be involved, and are
likely a byproduct of new environmental influences on our ancient genome. What we
now appreciate is that this genome consists of both human and co-evolved
microbial genes of the trillions of microbes residing in our body. Together,
host-microbe interactions may be determined by the changing diets and behaviors
of the Western lifestyle, influencing the etiopathogenesis of "new-age" diseases.
SCOPE OF REVIEW: This review takes an anthropological approach to the potential
interplay of the host and its gut microbiome in the post-industrialization rise
in chronic inflammatory and metabolic diseases. The discussion highlights both
the changes in diet and the physical environment that have co-occurred with these
diseases and the latest evidence demonstrating the role of host-microbe
interactions in understanding biological responses to the changing environment.
MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Technological advances that have led to changes in agriculture
and engineering have altered our eating and living behaviors in ways never before
possible in human history. These changes also have altered the bacterial
communities within the human body in ways that are seemingly linked with the rise
of many intestinal and systemic metabolic and inflammatory diseases. Insights
into the mechanisms of this reciprocal exchange between the environment and the
human gut microbiome may offer potential to attenuate the chronic health
conditions that derail quality of life. This article is part of a special issue
on microbiota.

In mammals, the intestinal epithelium is a tissue that contains two distinct
pools of stem cells: active intestinal stem cells and reserve intestinal stem
cells. The former are located in the crypt basement membrane and are responsible 
for maintaining epithelial homeostasis under intact conditions, whereas the
latter exhibit the capacity to facilitate epithelial regeneration after injury.
These two pools of cells can convert into each other, maintaining their
quantitative balance. In terms of the active intestinal stem cells, their
development into functional epithelium is precisely controlled by the following
signaling pathways: Wnt/β-catenin, Ras/Raf/Mek/Erk/MAPK, Notch and BMP/Smad.
However, mutations in some of the key regulator genes associated with these
signaling pathways, such as APC, Kras and Smad4, are also highly associated with 
gut malformations. At this point, clarifying the biological characteristics of
intestinal stem cells will increase the feasibility of preventing or treating
some intestinal diseases, such as colorectal cancer. Moreover, as preclinical
data demonstrate the therapeutic effects of colon stem cells on murine models of 
experimental colitis, the prospects of stem cell-based regenerative treatments
for ulcerous lesions in the gastrointestinal tract will be improved all the same.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is associated with a substantial alteration of specific
gut commensals, some of which may be involved in microbiota-mediated protection. 
In this study, microbiota cataloging of UC patients by 16S rRNA microbial
profiling revealed a marked reduction of bifidobacteria, in particular the
Bifidobacterium bifidum species, thus suggesting that this taxon plays a
biological role in the aetiology of UC. We investigated this further through an
in vivo trial by testing the effects of oral treatment with B. bifidum PRL2010 in
a wild-type murine colitis model. TNBS-treated mice receiving 10(9) cells of B.
bifidum PRL2010 showed a marked reduction of all colitis-associated histological 
indices as well as maintenance of mucosal integrity as it was shown by the
increase in the expression of many tight junction-encoding genes. The protective 
role of B. bifidum PRL2010, as well as its sortase-dependent pili, appears to be 
established through the induction of an innate immune response of the host. These
results highlight the importance of B. bifidum as a microbial biomarker for UC,
revealing its role in protection against experimentally induced colitis.

BACKGROUND: Axin1 is a scaffold protein in the β-catenin destruction complex,
which, if disrupted, contributes to pathogenesis of various human diseases,
including colorectal carcinogenesis and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). We
have previously demonstrated that Salmonella infection promotes the degradation
and plasma sequestration of Axin1, leading to bacterial invasiveness and
inflammatory responses. Vitamin D and the vitamin D receptor (VDR) appear to be
important regulators of IBD and colon cancer. Although VDR and Axin1 are all
involved in intestinal inflammation, it remains unclear whether these processes
are related or function independently. In the current study, we hypothesize that 
VDR is an important regulator for the maintenance of physiological level of
Axin1.
METHODS: Using the intestinal epithelial conditional VDR knockout mouse model
(VDRΔIEC) and cultured cell lines, influences of VDR status on the expression of 
Axin1 was evaluated by Western blots and real-time PCR. Loss- and
gain-of-function assays were used to investigate the regulation of VDR on Axin1
at the transcriptional and translational levels. Cells were treated with
cycloheximide or actinomycin for molecular mechanistic studies. Candidate genomic
VDR binding sites for Axin1 were tested by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
assay. Physical interactions among VDR, Axin1, and β-catenin were tested by
immunoprecipitation. Cellular localization of Axin1 with different VDR status was
determined by fractionation and immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: We found that VDR deletion led to lower protein and mRNA levels of
Axin1, whereas knockdown of Axin1 did not change the expression level of VDR
protein. Immunoprecipitation data did not support physical interaction between
VDR and Axin1. The VDR regulation of Axin1 was through a VDR genomic binding site
for Axin1 gene on the regulatory region. Fractionation data showed that cytosolic
Axin1 was significantly reduced due to VDR deletion, leaving the nuclear fraction
unchanged. In ileum, Axin1 was distributed in the cytosol of apical epithelium
and crypts.
CONCLUSION: VDR is important for the maintenance of physiological level of Axin1.
The discovery of Axin1 as a VDR target gene provides novel and fundamental
insights into the interactions between the VDR and β-catenin signaling pathways.

BACKGROUND: Smoking worsens Crohn's disease (CD). The aryl hydrocarbon receptor
(AhR) is a transcription factor that mediates the toxicity of dioxinlike
chemicals. We hypothesized that AHR variants and smoking influence CD.
METHODS: Exon-intron boundaries and coding and promoter regions of AHR gene were 
sequenced (28 patients with inflammatory bowel disease; 4 healthy controls). Two 
identified variants (rs7796976 and rs2066853) were studied for an association
with intestinal permeability (IP, oral sugar test) in patients with inflammatory 
bowel disease (stratified according to the smoking status). AHR expression was
analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in colonic biopsies 
from patients with CD (n = 53). Case-control analysis including a
genotype-phenotype correlation was performed for both variants (n = 767 patients 
with inflammatory bowel disease; n = 466 healthy controls).
RESULTS: Sequencing identified a putative promoter variant (rs7796976) and a
nonsynonymous variant (rs2066853; Arg554Lys) in AHR, both predicted to be
functionally relevant. The major G-allele of rs7796976 increased the risk for
disturbed IP (odds ratio 1.9, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-3.2) in CD but
not ulcerative colitis. We observed an additive effect of the rs7796976 genotype 
and smoking on IP (P = 0.005), which was also shown for rs2066853 (P = 0.004;
variants not linked). Both variants showed a genotype-dependent AHR expression in
colonic biopsies of patients with CD. No overall association with either CD or
ulcerative colitis was observed; however, the rs7796976 genotype and smoking
increased the risk for the L4 phenotype in CD.
CONCLUSION: Smoking and functionally relevant AHR variants increase IP in CD.
Because AhR is known to mediate between smoking and inflammation, these variants 
might be involved in the deleterious effect of smoking on CD.

OBJECTIVES: One-fifth of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) are primary
non-responders to anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy, and an estimated
10-15% will fail therapy annually. Little is known about the genetics of response
to anti-TNF therapy. The aim of our study was to identify genetic factors
associated with primary non-response (PNR) and loss of response to anti-TNFs in
CD.
METHODS: From a prospective registry, we characterized the response of 427 CD
patients to their first anti-TNF therapy. Patients were designated as achieving
primary response, durable response, and non-durable response based on clinical,
endoscopic, and radiologic criteria. Genotyping was performed on the Illumina
Immunochip. Separate genetic scores based on presence of predictive genetic
alleles were calculated for PNR and durable response and performance of clinical 
and genetics models were compared.
RESULTS: From 359 patients, 36 were adjudged to have PNR (10%), 200 had durable
response, and 74 had non-durable response. PNRs had longer disease duration and
were more likely to be smokers. Fifteen risk alleles were associated with PNR.
Patients with PNR had a significantly higher genetic risk score (GRS) (P =8 ×
10-12). A combined clinical-genetic model more accurately predicted PNR when
compared with a clinical only model (0.93 vs. 0.70, P <0.001). Sixteen distinct
single nucleotide polymorphisms predicted durable response with a higher GRS
(P =7 × 10-13). The GRSs for PNR and durable response were not mutually
correlated, suggesting distinct mechanisms.
CONCLUSIONS: Genetic risk alleles can predict primary non-response and durable
response to anti-TNF therapy in CD.

BACKGROUND: The protective effect of the chloroform extract of Cyperus rotundus
(CHCR) is attributed to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities.
Cytokines, important regulators of inflammation and repair, play a key role in
the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Targeting these cytokines
can effectively ameliorate the symptoms of IBD. The aim of the present study was 
to unravel the molecular mechanism through cytokine regulation in rats in
experimental IBD.
METHODS: Sprague Dawley rats were randomly allocated to 5 groups (n=6). Group I
served as the normal control. Group II served as the vehicle control and received
50% ethanol intracolonically on day 11 of the study. Group III served as the
model control. Group IV and Group V were given standard drug 5-aminosalicylic
acid (100 mg/kg) and CHCR (800 mg/kg), respectively, for 18 days once a day
orally. Colitis was induced with dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (180 mg/kg in 50%
ethanol) intracolonically in groups III-V on day 11 of the study. On day 18, the 
rats were euthanized and colon tissues were removed for IL-4, IL-6, IL-12, and
IFN-gamma gene expression studies using quantitative RT-PCR.
RESULTS: The expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-4, IL-6, IL-12,
and IFN-gamma were upregulated in the model control rats. Pretreatment with
5-aminosalicylic acid (100 mg/kg) and CHCR (800 mg/kg) significantly decreased
the fold of the expression of the above cytokines.
CONCLUSION: CHCR acts as a molecular brake and downregulates the expression of
proinflammatory cytokine genes; this is beneficial for reducing the severity of
the experimental IBD. Thus, Cyperus rotundus is a safe, economical, and effective
alternative for the treatment of patients with IBD.

BACKGROUND: Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 15/19 is part of the gut-liver
crosstalk accounting for bile acid (BA) metabolism regulation. Dysregulation of
fibroblast growth factor 15/19 signaling is observed in different pathological
conditions, for example, in gastrointestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel 
disease (IBD). To understand the molecular bases, we analyzed the enterohepatic
regulation of Fgf15-mediated pathway in 2 different inflammatory bowel disease
mouse models.
METHODS: Target genes of the BA-farnesoid-X-receptor (Fxr)-Ffg15 axis were
quantified by RT-PCR or western blotting in gut and liver of dextran sulfate
sodium (DSS)-treated and IL10 mice. Serum Fgf15 levels were analyzed by ELISA.
Biliary and fecal BA composition was differentiated by HPLC-MS/MS.
RESULTS: Dextran sulfate sodium-treated mice with ileum-sparing colitis showed
higher Fgf15 serum levels. In contrast, IL10 mice with ileitis had a trend toward
decreased Fgf15 serum levels compared with controls and increased expression of
Asbt as a negative Fxr-target gene. In hepatic tissue of both models, no
histological changes, but higher interleukin 6 (IL-6) mRNA expression and
down-regulation of Fxr and Cytochrom P450 7a1 mRNA expression were observed.
Fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 up-regulation was in line with higher Fgf15
serum levels in dextran sulfate sodium-treated mice. A distinct fecal BA profile 
was observed in both models with significantly higher levels of
taurine-conjugated BA in particular tauro-β-muricholic acid in IL10 mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Ileum-sparing colitis is characterized by activation of Fxr-Fgf15
signaling with higher expression of Fxr-target gene Fgf15, whereas ileal
inflammation showed no signs of Fxr-Fgf15 activation. Abundance of BA such as
T-β-MCA may be important for intestinal Fxr activation in mice.

Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a chronic and relapsing disorder, which
affects millions people worldwide. Current drug options cannot cure the disease
and may cause severe side effects. We developed a systematic framework to
identify novel IBD drugs exploiting millions of genomic signatures for chemical
compounds. Specifically, we searched all FDA-approved drugs for candidates that
share similar genomic profiles with IBD. In the evaluation experiments, our
approach ranked approved IBD drugs averagely within top 26% among 858 candidates,
significantly outperforming a state-of-art genomics-based drug repositioning
method (p-value < e-8). Our approach also achieved significantly higher average
precision than the state-of-art approach in predicting potential IBD drugs from
clinical trials (0.072 vs. 0.043, p<0.1) and off-label IBD drugs (0.198 vs.
0.138, p<0.1). Furthermore, we found evidences supporting the therapeutic
potential of the top-ranked drugs, such as Naloxone, in literature and through
analyzing target genes and pathways.

OBJECTIVE: Myelosuppression is a life-threatening complication of thiopurine
therapy, and the incidence of thiopurine-induced myelosuppression is higher in
East Asians than in Europeans. We investigated genetic factors associated with
thiopurine-induced leukopenia in patients with IBD.
DESIGN: A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted in
thiopurine-treated patients with IBD, followed by high-throughput sequencing of
genes identified as significant in the GWAS or those involved in thiopurine
metabolism (n=331). Significant loci associated with thiopurine-induced
leukopenia were validated in two additional replication cohorts (n=437 and
n=330). Functional consequences of FTO (fat mass and obesity-associated) variant 
were examined both in vitro and in vivo.
RESULTS: The GWAS identified two loci associated with thiopurine-induced
leukopenia (rs16957920, FTO intron; rs2834826, RUNX1 intergenic). High-throughput
targeted sequencing indicated that an FTO coding variant (rs79206939, p.A134T)
linked to rs16957920 is associated with thiopurine-induced leukopenia. This
result was further validated in two replication cohorts (combined p=1.3×10-8,
OR=4.3). The frequency of FTO p.A134T is 5.1% in Koreans but less than 0.1% in
Western populations. The p.A134T variation reduced FTO activity by 65% in the
nucleotide demethylase assay. In vivo experiments revealed that Fto-/- and Fto+/-
mice were more susceptible to thiopurine-induced myelosuppression than wild-type 
mice.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the hypomorphic FTO p.A134T variant is
associated with thiopurine-induced leukopenia. These results shed light on the
novel physiological role of FTO and provide a potential pharmacogenetic biomarker
for thiopurine therapy.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), manifesting as Crohn's disease (CD) and
ulcerative colitis (UC), is characterized by recurring episodes of inflammation
in gastrointestinal tract, in which aberrant production of regulatory cytokine
interleukin-10 (IL-10) presumably plays important role. Single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) that affect IL-10 production, such as rs1800896 (G/A) at
position -1082 and rs1800871 (C/T) at position -819 in the promoter region of the
IL10 gene, have been associated with CD and/or UC, but the results were
inconsistent. Another SNP that may alter IL-10 production, rs3024505 (C/T)
located immediately downstream of the IL10 gene has been recently identified. T
allele of rs3024505 was associated with both UC and CD in Western populations,
but the studies from East European countries are lacking. Therefore, our aim was 
to assess the association of rs3024505, rs1800896 and rs1800871 with Serbian IBD 
patients. To this end, 107 CD and 99 UC patients and 255 healthy controls were
genotyped. As a result, T allele of rs3024505 was associated with CD at allelic, 
genotypic (GT genotype) and haplotypic (GCCT haplotype) level, suggesting
potential role of this variant in susceptibility to CD. In contrast, CD patients 
carrying C allele of rs3024505 had significantly increased risk of anemia and
stricturing/penetrating behavior. No association was observed between rs3024505
and UC or SNPs in IL10 promoter region and any form of IBD. In conclusion,
rs3024505 SNP flanking the IL10 gene is associated with susceptibility and
severity of disease in Serbian CD patients, further validating its role as a
potential biomarker in IBD.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of Crohn's disease (CD) with
transcobalamin Ⅱ (TCN2) gene polymorphisms and serum homocysteine (Hcy), folate, 
and vitamin B12 levels in Chinese patients.
METHODS: In a total of 307 CD patients (CD group) and 574 healthy controls
(control group) of Han ethnicity selected at 4 hospitals in Wenzhou between
January 2007 and August 2015, TCN2 gene polymorphisms (rs1801198, C/G; rs9606756,
A/G) in peripheral blood were determined using improved multiple ligase detection
reaction (iMLDR). The Simplified Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) was
applied to evaluate activity of CD. Eighty-eight CD patients and 138 age- and
sex-matched controls were randomly selected from all the study subjects using
computer-generated random numbers, in whom serum Hcy level was tested by
enzymatic cycling assay, folate and vitamin B12 levels were examined by
chemiluminescence immunoassay.
RESULTS: (1) The mutant allele (G) and genotype (CG+ GG) of rs1801198 were not
significantly different between the CD group and the control group (both P>0.05),
but more prevalent in patients with stricturing CD than in controls (65.75% vs
56.10%, 93.15% vs 82.40%, both P<0.05). The frequencies of mutant allele (G) and 
heterozygous genotype (AG) of rs9606756 were higher in CD patients than in
controls (2.44% vs 1.05%, 4.89% vs 2.09%, both P<0.05), also higher in patients
with stricturing CD or ileocolonic CD compared with controls (stricturing CD:
4.79% vs 1.05%, 9.59% vs 2.09%; ileocolonic CD: 3.18% vs 1.05%, 6.36% vs 2.09%;
all P<0.05). The two polymorphic loci (rs1801198 and rs9606756) were shown to be 
in a weak linkage disequilibrium. The frequency of haplotype (GG) was higher in
the CD patients than in the controls (2.23% vs 0.81%, P<0.05). (2) When compared 
with the controls, the serum Hcy level was higher in the CD patients (P=0.023),
whereas the folate and vitamin B12 levels were decreased in the CD patients (both
P<0.001). The prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia (Hcy >15 μmol/L), folate
deficiency (folate <4 μg/L) and vitamin B12 deficiency (<203 ng/L) were higher in
the CD patients than in the controls (18.18% vs 4.35%, 27.27% vs 5.07%, 31.82% vs
5.07%, all P<0.01). Compared to the patients at remission stage (CDAI<5), the
serum Hcy level was increased in those at active stage (CDAI≥5) (P=0.005), while 
the folate and vitamin B12 levels were decreased in the patients ate active stage
(both P<0.05). (3) According to the results of multivariate linear regression
analysis, average Hcy level in the CD patients was negatively associated with
folate level (β=-0.494, P<0.001), while positively correlated with percentage of 
neutrophils (β=0.294, P=0.004). Unconditional Logistic regression showed that
both folate deficiency and vitamin B12 deficiency were independent risk factors
for CD (OR=5.415, OR=7.112, both P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: TCN2 rs1801198 mutation might be associated with increased risk of
stricturing CD. TCN2 rs9606756 mutation might be a potential functional locus to 
affect CD susceptibility. Individuals carrying the haplotype (GG) formed by TCN2 
(rs1801198 and rs9606756) seem to be at higher risk of developing CD.
Hyperhomocysteinemia, folate deficiency, and vitamin B12 deficiency are prevalent
in this cohort of CD patients of Han ethnicity from Zhejiang province. Both
folate deficiency and vitamin B12 deficiency are independent risk factors for CD.

BACKGROUND: Beneficial roles for glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)/GLP-1R signaling
have recently been described in diseases, where low-grade inflammation is a
common phenomenon. We investigated the effects of GLP-1 in Brunner's glands and
duodenum with abundant expression of GLP-1 receptors, as well as GLP-1 effect on 
colonic inflammation.
METHODS: RNA from Brunner's glands of GLP-1R knockout and wild-type mice were
subjected to full transcriptome profiling. Array results were validated by
quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in wild-type mice
and compared with samples from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients and
controls. In addition, we performed a detailed investigation of the effects of
exogenous liraglutide dosing in a T-cell driven adoptive transfer (AdTr) colitis 
mouse model.
RESULTS: Analyses of the Brunner's gland transcriptomes of GLP-1R knockout and
wild-type mice identified 722 differentially expressed genes. Upregulated
transcripts after GLP-1 dosing included IL-33, chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20), and
mucin 5b. Biopsies from IBD patients and controls, as well as data from the AdTr 
model, showed deregulated expression of GLP-1R, CCL20, and IL-33 in colon.
Circulating levels of GLP-1 were found to be increased in mice with colitis.
Finally, the colonic cytokine levels and disease scores of the AdTr model
indicated reduced levels of colonic inflammation in liraglutide-dosed animals.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that IL-33, GLP-1R, and CCL20 are deregulated in
human IBD, and that prophylactic treatment with 0.6 mg/kg liraglutide improves
disease in AdTr colitis. In addition, GLP-1 receptor agonists upregulate IL-33,
mucin 5b, and CCL20 in murine Brunner's glands. Taken together, our data indicate
that GLP-1 receptor agonists affect gut homeostasis in both proximal and distal
parts of the gut.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) arises by unknown environmental triggers in
genetically susceptible individuals. Epigenetic regulation of gene expression may
integrate internal and external influences and may thereby modulate disease
susceptibility. Epigenetic modification may also affect the germ-line and in
certain contexts can be inherited to offspring. This study investigates
epigenetic alterations consequent to experimental murine colitis induced by
dextran sodium sulphate (DSS), and their paternal transmission to offspring.
Genome-wide methylome- and transcriptome-profiling of intestinal epithelial cells
(IECs) and sperm cells of males of the F0 generation, which received either DSS
and consequently developed colitis (F0(DSS)), or non-supplemented tap water
(F0(Ctrl)) and hence remained healthy, and of their F1 offspring was performed
using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and RNA-sequencing
(RNA-Seq), respectively. Offspring of F0(DSS) males exhibited aberrant
methylation and expression patterns of multiple genes, including Igf1r and Nr4a2,
which are involved in energy metabolism. Importantly, DSS colitis in F0(DSS) mice
was associated with decreased body weight at baseline of their F1 offspring, and 
these F1 mice exhibited increased susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis compared 
to offspring from F0(Ctrl) males. This study hence demonstrates epigenetic
transmissibility of metabolic and inflammatory traits resulting from experimental
colitis.

BACKGROUND: Most cases of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are caused by complex 
host-environment interaction. There are a number of conditions associated with a 
single-gene mutation, most cases are very early onset (aged < 6 yr), present with
a unique form of disease and often have atypical features.
METHODS: Whole-exome data for 147 pediatric patients with IBD were interrogated
for a panel of 51 genes associated with monogenic IBD. Observed variation was
categorized according to the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG)
guidelines to identify rare, novel, and known variants that might contribute to
IBD.
RESULTS: Five hundred seventy-four variants were identified across 51 genes.
These were categorized in line with ACMG guidance to remove benign variants and
to identify "pathogenic" and "likely pathogenic" variants. In 6 patients, we
observed 6 pathogenic variants of which CYBA(c.287+2T>C), COL7A1(c.6501+1G>C),
LIG4(p.R814X), and XIAP(p.T470S) were known causative mutations, and
FERMT1(p.R271Q) and SKIV2L(c.354+5G>A) were novel. In the 3 patients with XIAP,
SKIV2L, and FERMT1 variants, individuals' disease features resembled the
monogenic phenotype. This was despite apparent heterozygous carriage of
pathogenic variation for the latter 2 genes. The XIAP variant was observed in a
hemizygous male.
CONCLUSIONS: Whole-exome sequencing allows for identification of known and de
novo potentially causative mutations in genes associated with monogenic IBD.
Although these are rare conditions, it is vital to identify causative mutations
early to improve prognosis. We postulate that in a subset of IBD, heterozygous
mutations (in genes believed to manifest IBD through autosomal recessive
inheritance) may contribute to clinical presentation.

Crohn's disease affects those individuals with polygenic risk factors. The
identified risk loci indicate that the genetic architecture of Crohn's disease
involves both innate and adaptive immunity and the response to the intestinal
environment including the microbiome. Genetic risk alone, however, predicts only 
25% of disease, indicating that other factors, including the intestinal
environment, can shape the epigenome and also confer heritable risk to patients. 
Patients with Crohn's disease can have purely inflammatory disease, penetrating
disease or fibrostenosis. Analysis of the genetic risk combined with epigenetic
marks of Crohn's disease and other disease associated with organ fibrosis reveals
common events are affecting the genes and pathways key to development of
fibrosis. This review will focus on what is known about the mechanisms by which
genetic and epigenetic risk factors determine development of fibrosis in Crohn's 
disease and contrast that with other fibrotic conditions.

Large-scale reference data sets of human genetic variation are critical for the
medical and functional interpretation of DNA sequence changes. Here we describe
the aggregation and analysis of high-quality exome (protein-coding region) DNA
sequence data for 60,706 individuals of diverse ancestries generated as part of
the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC). This catalogue of human genetic
diversity contains an average of one variant every eight bases of the exome, and 
provides direct evidence for the presence of widespread mutational recurrence. We
have used this catalogue to calculate objective metrics of pathogenicity for
sequence variants, and to identify genes subject to strong selection against
various classes of mutation; identifying 3,230 genes with near-complete depletion
of predicted protein-truncating variants, with 72% of these genes having no
currently established human disease phenotype. Finally, we demonstrate that these
data can be used for the efficient filtering of candidate disease-causing
variants, and for the discovery of human 'knockout' variants in protein-coding
genes.

BACKGROUND: Exome sequencing has been emerged as a primary method to identify
detailed sequence variants associated with complex diseases including Crohn's
disease in the protein-coding regions of human genome. However, constructing an
interpretable model for exome sequencing data is challenging because of the huge 
diversity of genomic variation. In addition, it has been known that utilizing
biologically relevant information in a rigorous manner is essential for
effectively extracting disease-associated information.
RESULTS: In this paper, we incorporate three different types of biological
knowledge such as predicted pathogenicity, disease gene annotation, and
functional interaction network of human genes, and integrate them with exome
sequence data in non-negative matrix tri-factorization framework. Based on the
proposed method, we successfully identified Crohn's disease patients from exome
sequencing data and achieved the area under the receiver operating
characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.816, while other clustering methods not using
biological information achieved the AUC of 0.786. Moreover, the disease
association score derived from our method showed higher correlation with Crohn's 
disease genes than other unrelated genes.
CONCLUSIONS: As a consequence, by integrating biological information across
multiple levels such as variant, gene, and systems, our method could be useful
for identifying disease susceptibility and its associated genes from exome
sequencing data.

BACKGROUND: Sodium selenite has been shown to have a protective role in
experimental colitis. Th1 and Th17 responses are involved in the pathogenesis of 
dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis and inflammatory bowel disease. This
study investigated whether sodium selenite can suppress Th1/Th17-mediated
experimental colitis.
METHODS: Mice were administered sodium selenite (2μg/g body weight) by gavage
daily for 30days. Beginning on day 21, mice were administered 2.5% oral DSS for
9days. The mice were sacrificed on day 31. Survival rates, clinical symptoms,
colon lengths, and histological changes were determined.
RESULTS: Pretreatment with sodium selenite (2μg/g body weight) improved survival 
rates, colon shortening, body weight loss, disease activity index, and
histopathological score in mice with DSS-induced colitis. Pretreatment with
sodium selenite restored interleukin-10 and Foxp3 excretion, as well as reducing 
the levels of interferon-γ and interleukin-17A.
CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment with sodium selenite showed therapeutic potential for
preventing colitis in mice. This effect may be mediated by the immunomodulation
of regulatory T cells, expressing anti-inflammatory genes that suppress Th1 and
Th17 responses.

Inflammatory bowel disease consists of multifactorial diseases whose common
manifestation is inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract and their
pathogenesis remains unknown. This study aimed to analyse the gene polymorphisms 
in Brazilian patients with inflammatory bowel disease. A total of 101 patients
diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease were analysed for the tumour necrosis
factor-alpha (-308 G/A; rs1800629) and interleukin-10 (-1082 G/A; rs1800896) gene
polymorphisms. Genotyping was performed through polymerase chain
reaction-sequence-specific primer, then fractionated on 2% agarose gel and
visualized after staining by ethidium bromide. The anatomic-clinical form of
Crohn's disease (CD) predominant was the inflammatory (32.75%), followed by
fistulizing (29.31%) and 27.58% stricturing. As control group, a total of 136
healthy subjects, from the same geographical region, were enrolled. The
statistical analyses were performed using R program. The frequency of the A
allele at tumour necrosis factor-alpha was high in ulcerative colitis (UC)
patients (51%) than in controls (22%; P > 0.01). No statistical difference was
found with the genotypic and allelic frequencies of CD patients compared to
controls (P = 0.54). The polymorphism -1082G/A of interleukin-10 was not
statistical different between the diseases compared to controls. Tumour necrosis 
factor-alpha (TNF-α) (-308G/A) is associated with UC onset, suggesting that the
presence of -308A allele could confer a relative risk of 3.62 more to develop UC 
in general population. Further studies, increasing the number of individuals,
should be performed to ratify the role of TNF-α in the inflammatory bowel disease
pathogenesis.

The cause of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is still unknown, but there is
growing evidence that environmental factors such as epigenetic changes can
contribute to the disease etiology. The aim of this study was to identify newly
hypermethylated genes in ulcerative colitis (UC) using a genome-wide DNA
methylation approach. Using an Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array, we
screened the DNA methylation changes in three normal colon controls and eight UC 
patients. Using these methylation profiles, 48 probes associated with CpG
promoter methylation showed differential hypermethylation between UC patients and
normal controls. Technical validations for methylation analyses in a larger
series of UC patients (n = 79) were performed by methylation-specific PCR (MSP)
and bisulfite sequencing analysis. We finally found that three genes (FAM217B,
KIAA1614 and RIBC2) that were significantly elevating the promoter methylation
levels in UC compared to normal controls. Interestingly, we confirmed that three 
genes were transcriptionally silenced in UC patient samples by qRT-PCR,
suggesting that their silencing is correlated with the promoter hypermethylation.
Pathway analyses were performed using GO and KEGG databases with differentially
hypermethylated genes in UC. Our results highlight that aberrant hypermethylation
was identified in UC patients which can be a potential biomarker for detecting
UC. Moreover, pathway-enriched hypermethylated genes are possibly implicating
important cellular function in the pathogenesis of UC. Overall, this study
describes a newly hypermethylated gene panel in UC patients and provides new
clinical information that can be used for the diagnosis and therapeutic treatment
of IBD.

BACKGROUND: TGFβ is a multifunctional cytokine that is critical in regulating
mucosal immunity. Murine studies have revealed that disruption of canonical TGFβ 
signaling leads to systemic inflammation including colitis. Loeys-Dietz syndrome 
(LDS) results from heterozygous mutations in the genes encoding the subunits of
the TGFβ receptor.
METHODS: All patients with confirmed mutations in TGFBR1 or TGFBR2, seen in the
Johns Hopkins Connective Tissue Disorders clinic, were asked to participate in
the study. Ninety-three consecutive patients were enrolled, including 4 with
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Using the Illumina Immunochip array, we
undertook an exploratory analysis to evaluate the potential genetic risk factors 
that could predict which patients with LDS would develop IBD.
RESULTS: We report an increased prevalence of IBD in patients with LDS types I
and II. We describe the course of several patients. In this small sample, the 3
whites with IBD had a genetic risk score in the top 6 highest scores of patients 
evaluated.
CONCLUSION: We report a 10-fold increase in the prevalence of IBD in patients
with LDS compared with the general population. Onset of disease in 3 of the 4
patients was at less than 18 years, and the clinical course in 2 of the 4 was
severe with a poor response to traditional medications. Further evaluation of the
genetic risk score is needed to determine whether it can predict which patients
with LDS are most likely to develop IBD. This case series of patients with LDS
with IBD suggests that defective TGFβ signaling may have an influence on IBD
risk.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of genetic
variants associated with complex traits and diseases. However, elucidating the
causal genes underlying GWAS hits remains challenging. We applied the summary
data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) method to 28 GWAS summary datasets to
identify genes whose expression levels were associated with traits and diseases
due to pleiotropy or causality (the expression level of a gene and the trait are 
affected by the same causal variant at a locus). We identified 71 genes, of which
17 are novel associations (no GWAS hit within 1 Mb distance of the genes). We
integrated all the results in an online database (
http://www.cnsgenomics/shiny/SMRdb/ ), providing important resources to
prioritize genes for further follow-up, for example in functional studies.

Protein-truncating variants protective against human disease provide in vivo
validation of therapeutic targets. Here we used targeted sequencing to conduct a 
search for protein-truncating variants conferring protection against inflammatory
bowel disease exploiting knowledge of common variants associated with the same
disease. Through replication genotyping and imputation we found that a predicted 
protein-truncating variant (rs36095412, p.R179X, genotyped in 11,148 ulcerative
colitis patients and 295,446 controls, MAF=up to 0.78%) in RNF186, a single-exon 
ring finger E3 ligase with strong colonic expression, protects against ulcerative
colitis (overall P=6.89 × 10(-7), odds ratio=0.30). We further demonstrate that
the truncated protein exhibits reduced expression and altered subcellular
localization, suggesting the protective mechanism may reside in the loss of an
interaction or function via mislocalization and/or loss of an essential
transmembrane domain.

BACKGROUND: Reduced microbial diversity in human intestines has been implicated
in various conditions such as diabetes, colorectal cancer, and inflammatory bowel
disease. The role of physical fitness in the context of human intestinal
microbiota is currently not known. We used high-throughput sequencing to analyze 
fecal microbiota of 39 healthy participants with similar age, BMI, and diets but 
with varying cardiorespiratory fitness levels. Fecal short-chain fatty acids were
analyzed using gas chromatography.
RESULTS: We showed that peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), the gold standard measure
of cardiorespiratory fitness, can account for more than 20 % of the variation in 
taxonomic richness, after accounting for all other factors, including diet. While
VO2peak did not explain variation in beta diversity, it did play a significant
role in explaining variation in the microbiomes' predicted metagenomic functions,
aligning positively with genes related to bacterial chemotaxis, motility, and
fatty acid biosynthesis. These predicted functions were supported by measured
increases in production of fecal butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid associated
with improved gut health, amongst physically fit participants. We also identified
increased abundances of key butyrate-producing taxa (Clostridiales, Roseburia,
Lachnospiraceae, and Erysipelotrichaceae) amongst these individuals, which likely
contributed to the observed increases in butyrate levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study show that cardiorespiratory fitness is
correlated with increased microbial diversity in healthy humans and that the
associated changes are anchored around a set of functional cores rather than
specific taxa. The microbial profiles of fit individuals favor the production of 
butyrate. As increased microbiota diversity and butyrate production is associated
with overall host health, our findings warrant the use of exercise prescription
as an adjuvant therapy in combating dysbiosis-associated diseases.

Dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota and hyperactive immune responses seem to be
crucial for the uncontrolled inflammation in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).
Modulation of the microbiome and immune stimulation of the intestinal epithelium 
were suggested as therapeutic approaches. In this study, live attenuated and dead
bacterial cells of Salmonella Typhimurium SL7207 - a widely used bacterial vector
for gene therapy were administered in DSS-induced colitis in mice. C57BL/6 mice
were divided into four groups. The first group received pure water (CTRL). The
other three groups received 2% dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) to induce colitis.
Two DSS groups were treated with live attenuated (DSS live) or inactivated (DSS
dead) Salmonella by gastric gavage. Intake of 2% DSS caused weight loss in all
DSS groups compared to control mice with some improvement in DSS live group on
the last day of the experiment. Significantly longer colon and improved stool
consistency were reported in DSS live group, but not DSS dead group, when
compared with DSS. Significant enlargement of spleens was observed only in DSS
and DSS dead groups compared to control. Significant differences in stool
consistency, colon length and spleen enlargement were observed between DSS live
and DSS dead groups with beneficial effects of live bacteria. Interestingly,
significant decrease in myeloperoxidase activity was detected in both, DSS live
and DSS dead groups compared to the DSS group. On the basis of these results,
progression of colitis seems to be beneficially influenced not only by live
attenuated but to some extent also by inactivated Salmonella Typhimurium SL7207. 
Our results provide evidence that Salmonella-based gene therapy vectors are able 
to positively alter gut homeostasis during DSS-induced colitis.SIGNIFICANCE AND
IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Restoration of gut homeostasis has a great importance in
IBD. Here, we tested the nonspecific effect of the strain Salmonella Typhimurium 
SL7207 on the course of colitis to find out whether the potential effect would be
mediated by activity of live bacterial cells or by bacterial structures that are 
also present in dead bacteria. Live bacterial therapy of colitis showed a
beneficial effect on clinical signs as well as on macroscopic and inflammatory
markers of colitis. On the other hand, therapy with dead bacteria showed
inconsistent effects, negative in most clinical outcomes, positive especially in 
myeloperoxidase activity. Our data indicate that the beneficial effect of
bacterial gene therapy vectors carrying therapeutic genes might be, at least
partially, caused by the bacterial vector instead of the therapeutic gene.

Psychological stress can exacerbate inflammatory bowel disease. However, the
mechanisms underlying how psychological stress affects gut inflammation remain
unclear. Here, we focused on the relationship between changes in the microbial
community of mucosa-associated commensal bacteria (MACB) and mucosal immune
responses induced by chronic psychological stress in a murine model of ulcerative
colitis. Furthermore, we examined the effect of probiotic treatment on
exacerbated colitis and MACB composition changes induced by chronic psychological
stress. Repeated water avoidance stress (rWAS) in B6-Tcra-/- mice severely
exacerbated colitis, which was evaluated by both colorectal tissue weight and
histological score of colitis. rWAS treatment increased mRNA expression of UCN2
and IFN-γ in large intestinal lamina propria mononuclear cells (LI-LPMC).
Interestingly, exacerbated colitis was associated with changes in the microbial
community of MACB, specifically loss of bacterial species diversity and an
increase in the component ratio of Clostridium, revealed by 16S rRNA gene
amplicon analysis. Finally, the oral administration of a probiotic Lactobacillus 
strain was protective against the exacerbation of colitis and was associated with
a change in the bacterial community of MACB in rWAS-exposed Tcra-/- mice. Taken
together, these results suggested that loss of species diversity in MACB might
play a key role in exacerbated colitis induced by chronic psychological stress.
In addition, probiotic treatment may be used as a tool to preserve the diversity 
of bacterial species in MACB and alleviate gut inflammation induced by
psychological stress.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Genome-wide association studies have identified 200
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) loci, but the genetic architecture of Crohn's
disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis remain incompletely defined. Here, we aimed
to identify novel associations between IBD and functional genetic variants using 
the Illumina ExomeChip (San Diego, CA).
METHODS: Genotyping was performed in 10,523 IBD cases and 5726 non-IBD controls. 
There were 91,713 functional single-nucleotide polymorphism loci in coding
regions analyzed. A novel identified association was replicated further in 2
independent cohorts. We further examined the association of the identified
single-nucleotide polymorphism with microbiota from 338 mucosal lavage samples in
the Mucosal Luminal Interface cohort measured using 16S sequencing.
RESULTS: We identified an association between CD and a missense variant encoding 
alanine or threonine at position 391 in the zinc transporter solute carrier
family 39, member 8 protein (SLC39A8 alanine 391 threonine, rs13107325) and
replicated the association with CD in 2 replication cohorts (combined
meta-analysis P = 5.55 × 10(-13)). This variant has been associated previously
with distinct phenotypes including obesity, lipid levels, blood pressure, and
schizophrenia. We subsequently determined that the CD risk allele was associated 
with altered colonic mucosal microbiome composition in both healthy controls (P =
.009) and CD cases (P = .0009). Moreover, microbes depleted in healthy carriers
strongly overlap with those reduced in CD patients (P = 9.24 × 10(-16)) and
overweight individuals (P = 6.73 × 10(-16)).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that an SLC39A8-dependent shift in the gut
microbiome could explain its pleiotropic effects on multiple complex diseases
including CD.

High-throughput technologies revealed new categories of genes, including the long
noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), involved in the pathogenesis of human disease; however,
the role of lncRNAs in the ulcerative colitis (UC) has not been evaluated. Gene
expression profiling was used to develop lncRNA signatures in UC samples. Jurkat 
T cells were activated by PMA/ionomycin subsequently interferon-γ (IFNG) and
tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α protein levels were assessed by ELISA. Anti-sense
molecules were designed to block IFNG-AS1 expression. A unique set of lncRNAs was
differentially expressed between UC and control samples. Of these, IFNG-AS1 was
among the highest statistically significant lncRNAs (fold change: 5.27, P value: 
7.07E-06). Bioinformatic analysis showed that IFNG-AS1 was associated with the
IBD susceptibility loci SNP rs7134599 and its genomic location is adjacent to the
inflammatory cytokine IFNG. In mouse models of colitis, active colitis samples
had increased colonic expression of this lncRNA. Utilizing the Jurkat T cell
model, we found IFNG-AS1 to positively regulate IFNG expression. Novel lncRNA
signatures differentiate UC patients with active disease, patients in remission, 
and control subjects. A subset of these lncRNAs was found to be associated with
the clinically validated IBD susceptibility loci. IFNG-AS1 was one of these
differentially expressed lncRNAs in UC patients and found to regulate the key
inflammatory cytokine, IFNG, in CD4 T cells. Taking these findings together, our 
study revealed novel lncRNA signatures deregulated in UC and identified IFNG-AS1 
as a novel regulator of IFNG inflammatory responses, suggesting the potential
importance of noncoding RNA mechanisms on regulation of inflammatory bowel
disease-related inflammatory responses.

Genome-wide association studies have revealed several common genetic risk
variants for ulcerative colitis (UC). However, little is known about the
contribution of rare, large effect genetic variants to UC susceptibility. In this
study, we performed a deep targeted re-sequencing of 122 genes in Dutch UC
patients in order to investigate the contribution of rare variants to the genetic
susceptibility to UC. The selection of genes consists of 111 established human UC
susceptibility genes and 11 genes that lead to spontaneous colitis when
knocked-out in mice. In addition, we sequenced the promoter regions of 45 genes
where known variants exert cis-eQTL-effects. Targeted pooled re-sequencing was
performed on DNA of 790 Dutch UC cases. The Genome of the Netherlands project
provided sequence data of 500 healthy controls. After quality control and
prioritization based on allele frequency and pathogenicity probability, follow-up
genotyping of 171 rare variants was performed on 1021 Dutch UC cases and 1166
Dutch controls. Single-variant association and gene-based analyses identified an 
association of rare variants in the MUC2 gene with UC. The associated variants in
the Dutch population could not be replicated in a German replication cohort (1026
UC cases, 3532 controls). In conclusion, this study has identified a putative
role for MUC2 on UC susceptibility in the Dutch population and suggests a
population-specific contribution of rare variants to UC.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Butyricicoccus is a butyrate-producing clostridial cluster
IV genus whose numbers are reduced in the stool of ulcerative colitis [UC]
patients. Conditioned medium of Butyricicoccus [B.] pullicaecorum prevents tumour
necrosis factor alpha [TNFα]-induced increase in epithelial permeability in
vitro. Since butyrate influences intestinal barrier integrity, we further
investigated the relationship between the abundance of mucosa-associated
Butyricicoccus and the expression of butyrate-regulated tight junction [TJ]
genes.
METHODS: Tight junction protein 1 [TJP1], occludin [OCLN], claudin-1 [CLDN1], and
Butyricicoccus 16S rRNA expression was analysed in a collection of colonic
biopsies of healthy controls and UC patients with active disease. The effect of
butyrate and B. pullicaecorum conditioned medium on TJ gene expression was
investigated in TNFα-stimulated Caco-2 monolayers and inflamed mucosal biopsies
of UC patients.
RESULTS: TJP1 expression was significantly decreased in inflamed UC mucosa,
whereas CLDN1 mRNA levels were increased. OCLN did not differ significantly
between the groups. Mucosa-associated Butyricicoccus 16S rRNA transcripts were
reduced in active UC patients compared with healthy controls. Interestingly,
Butyricicoccus activity negatively correlated with CLDN1 expression. Butyrate
reversed the inflammation-induced increase of CLDN1 protein levels, and
stimulation of inflamed UC biopsies with B. pullicaecorum conditioned medium
normalized CLDN1 mRNA levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Butyricicoccus is a mucosa-associated bacterial genus
under-represented in colonic mucosa of patients with active UC, whose activity
inversely correlates with CLDN1 expression. Butyrate and B. pullicaecorum
conditioned medium reduce CLDN1 expression, supporting its use as a pharmabiotic 
preserving epithelial TJ integrity.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) act as important post-transcriptional regulators of gene
expression by targeting the 3'-untranslated region of their target genes. Altered
expression of miR-16 is reported in human ulcerative colitis (UC), but its role
in the development of the disease remains unclear. Adenosine through adenosine
A2a receptor (A2aAR) could inhibit nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) signaling
pathway in inflammation. Here we identified overexpression of miR-16 and
down-regulation of A2aAR in the colonic mucosa of active UC patients. We
demonstrated that miR-16 negatively regulated the expression of the A2aAR at the 
post-transcriptional level. Furthermore, transfection of miR-16 mimics promoted
nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 protein and expression of pro-inflammatory
cytokines, IFN-γ and IL-8 in colonic epithelial cells. Treatment with miR-16
inhibitor could reverse these effects in cells. The A2aAR-mediated effects of
miR-16 on the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway were confirmed by the
A2aAR knockdown assay. Our results suggest that miR-16 regulated the immune and
inflammatory responses, at least in part, by suppressing the expression of the
A2aAR to control the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway.

An Analysis of IL-10/IL-10R Genetic Factors Related to Risk of Colon Cancer and
Inflammatory Bowel Disease in a Han Chinese Population.

Cai J, Zhang Z.

BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at high
risk of developing colon cancer and represent a valuable patient cohort for
studying the correlation between chronic inflammation and cancer formation.
Cytokines play key roles in the regulation of systemic inflammation, local tissue
damage, and immunomodulation involved in tumor development and progression.
Therefore, functional polymorphisms in genes that encode cytokines and cytokine
receptors represent potential candidate genes associated with carcinogenesis. The
present study aimed to ascertain if any of the candidate single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in inflammation-related genes IL-10/IL-10R are associated
with colon cancer or IBD in Han Chinese population.
METHODS: A case-control study in a Chinese Han cohort was conducted and included 
375 patients with colon cancer, 278 patients with IBD, and 382 age and gender
matched healthy controls. Genotyping of four candidate SNPs (IL-10 rs1800896,
rs1800872, rs3024505, and IL-10R rs9610) was performed and analysis was done
using the MassARRAY system based on the MALDI-TOF MS platform.
RESULTS: The C allele at rs1800872 may be a protective factor incolon cancer (OR 
= 0.770; 95% CI: 0.653 - 0.909; p = 0.002). A decreased risk of colon cancer in
patients with rs1800872 AC genotype (OR = 0.794; 95% CI, 0.664 - 950; p = 0.011),
CC genotype (OR = 0.589; 95% CI, 0.372 - 0.933; p = 0.022) or AC/CC genotype (OR 
= 792; 95% CI, 0.678 - 0.925; p = 0.003) was observed, compared with the common
AA genotype. Conversely, carriers of the variant T allele of rs3024505 flanking
the IL-10 gene were at increased risk of IBD (OR = 1.999; 95% CI: 1.174 - 3.401; 
p = 0.009). Compared with the common CC genotype, carrying heterozygous (OR =
1.762; 95% CI, 1.030 - 3.012; p = 0.036), or heterozygous and homozygous combined
(OR = 1.874; 95% CI, 1.105 - 3.177; p = 0.018) at the IL-10 rs3024505, was
associated with increased risk of IBD. Stratified analysis showed that a positive
association was identified between the AC/CC genotype at IL-10 rs1800872 and
tumor stage (p = 0.029).
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the variants in the IL-10 gene may change
the risk of both colon cancer and IBD. The C allele at rs1800872 may be a
protective factor in colon cancer and the T allele at rs3024505 may be a risk
factor in IBD in a Han Chinese population.

Autophagy is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Organs such as the
eye and brain are immunologically privileged. Here, we demonstrate that autophagy
is essential for maintaining ocular immune privilege. Deletion of multiple
autophagy genes in macrophages leads to an inflammation-mediated eye disease
called uveitis that can cause blindness. Loss of autophagy activates
inflammasome-mediated IL1B secretion that increases disease severity. Inhibition 
of caspase activity by gene deletion or pharmacological means completely reverses
the disease phenotype. Of interest, experimental uveitis was also increased in a 
model of Crohn disease, a systemic autoimmune disease in which patients often
develop uveitis, offering a potential mechanistic link between macrophage
autophagy and systemic disease. These findings directly implicate the homeostatic
process of autophagy in blinding eye disease and identify novel pathways for
therapeutic intervention in uveitis.

The collection of microbes and their genes that exist within and on the human
body, collectively known as the microbiome has emerged as a principal factor in
human health and disease. Humans and microbes have established a symbiotic
association over time, and perturbations in this association have been linked to 
several immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID) including inflammatory bowel
disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis. IMID is a term used to
describe a group of chronic, highly disabling diseases that affect different
organ systems. Though a cornerstone commonality between IMID is the idiopathic
nature of disease, a considerable portion of their pathobiology overlaps
including epidemiological co-occurrence, genetic susceptibility loci and
environmental risk factors. At present, it is clear that persons with an IMID are
at an increased risk for developing comorbidities, including additional IMID.
Advancements in sequencing technologies and a parallel explosion of 16S rDNA and 
metagenomics community profiling studies have allowed for the characterization of
microbiomes throughout the human body including the gut, in a myriad of human
diseases and in health. The main challenge now is to determine if alterations of 
gut flora are common between IMID or, if particular changes in the gut community 
are in fact specific to a single disease. Herein, we review and discuss the
relationships between the gut microbiota and IMID.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: To establish the prevalence of the single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) of endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1), IL-23
receptor (IL-23R), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT-3)
and Janus kinase 2 (JAK-2) in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and inflammatory bowel 
disease (IBD) in a Turkish population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 562 subjects who presented at the Ankara
University internal medicine departments of rheumatology and gastroenterology
outpatient clinics were recruited in this study, including 365 patients with AS, 
197 patients with IBD and 230 healthy controls. ERAP1, IL-23R, STAT-3 and JAK-2) 
were genotyped in competitive allele-specific polymerase chain reactions.
RESULTS: The ERAP1 (rs26653) polymorphism was found to increase the disease risk 
in patients with AS and IBD compared with the control group (p=0.02 and p=0.01,
respectively). In addition, this polymorphism revealed a significant relationship
with the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) and the Bath
AS Functional Index (BASFI) in patients with AS (r=0.829, p < 0.001 and r=0.731, 
p < 0.001, respectively).
CONCLUSION: The ERAP1 gene polymorphism might be a risk factor in the
pathogenesis of AS and IBD. In contrast, IL-23R gene polymorphisms may serve a
protective role in AS and IBD.

The perplexing nature of dynamic glycosylation modification plays imperative role
in determining the regulatory role of key glycoconjugates involved in immune
system. Systematic analysis of change in expression pattern of glycogenes and
lectins can bring in a comprehensive understanding of genetic basis of the
glycobiological changes occurring in pathological condition. Advancement in the
field of glycobiology has capacitated the process of linking gene expression
changes of glycogenes with its biological function. This instigated us to
systematically analyze changes in expression patterns focusing on glycome
genomics under diverse gastrointestinal immune dysfunction background. To
necessitate this, as a pilot project, we carefully integrated several publically 
available databases to construct a glycosylation process associated gene set as
well as public expression microarray data associated with gastrointestinal
infections into an online database called Glycosylation and Gut Associated Immune
Tolerance (GlycoGAIT). Currently the database comprises of 548 well characterized
genes belonging to glycogenes and lectins along with gene expression data
obtained from human biopsy samples under both H. pylori infection and
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) condition. The user-friendly interface enables
the users to quickly compare and interpret changes in expression patterns of
glycome genomics under different gut associated inflammatory conditions. The
database is available online at: https://apps.connexios.com/glycogait/.

OBJECTIVE: Both Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) have a complex
etiology involving multiple genetic and environmental factors. Multiple UC and CD
susceptibility genes have been identified through genome-wide association studies
and subsequent meta-analyses. The aim of this meta-analysis was to clarify the
impact of MYO9B gene polymorphisms on CD and UC risk.
METHODS: The PubMed, Elsevier Science Direct and Embase databases were searched
to identify eligible studies that were published before October 2014. Data were
extracted and pooled crude odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%
CIs) were calculated.
RESULTS: A total of 11 studies, containing 3297 CD cases, 3903 UC cases and 8174 
controls were included in this meta-analysis. Bonferroni correction results
showed that rs1545620 A/C polymorphism of MYO9B gene was associated with both CD 
and UC susceptibility in Caucasians (OR=0.88, 95% CI=0.82∼0.95, P=0.001; OR=0.82,
95% CI=0.76∼0.89, P<0.001), but not in Chinese. rs1457092 G/T and rs2305764 C/T
polymorphisms are associated with UC susceptibility (OR=0.85, 95% CI=0.79∼0.91,
P<0.001; OR=0.88, 95% CI=0.83∼0.93, P<0.001), but not with CD susceptibility in
Caucasians.
CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggested that rs1545620 is both CD and UC
susceptible locus in Caucasians; rs1457092 and rs2305764 are UC susceptible loci,
but are not CD susceptible loci in Caucasians. Further studies with more sample
size are needed for a definitive conclusion.

Thiopurines are commonly used drugs in the therapy of Crohn's disease, but
unfortunately only show a 30% response rate. The biological basis for the
thiopurine response is unclear, thus hampering patient selection prior to
treatment. A genetic risk factor associated specifically with Crohn's disease is 
a variant in ATG16L1 that reduces autophagy. We have previously shown that
autophagy is involved in dendritic cell (DC)-T-cell interactions and cytoskeletal
regulation. Here we further investigated the role of autophagy in DC cytoskeletal
modulation and cellular trafficking. Autophagy-deficient DC displayed loss of
filopodia, altered podosome distribution, and increased membrane ruffling, all
consistent with increased cellular adhesion. Consequently, autophagy-deficient DC
showed reduced migration. The cytoskeletal aberrations were mediated through
hyperactivation of Rac1, a known thiopurine target. Indeed thiopurines restored
the migratory defects in autophagy-deficient DC. Clinically, the ATG16L1 risk
variant associated with increased response to thiopurine treatment in patients
with Crohn's disease but not ulcerative colitis. These results suggest that the
association between ATG16L1 and Crohn's disease is mediated at least in part
through Rac1 hyperactivation and subsequent defective DC migration. As this
phenotype can be corrected using thiopurines, ATG16L1 genotyping may be useful in
the identification of patients that will benefit most from thiopurine treatment.

Wild-type human interleukin-10 (hIL-10) is a non-covalent homodimer with a short 
half-life, thus limiting its therapeutic applications in vivo. To avoid loss of
function due to dimer dissociation, we designed a synthetic hIL-10 analog by
bridging both monomers via a 15 amino acid-long peptide spacer in a C-terminal to
N-terminal fashion. For secretory expression in Escherichia coli, a 1156 bp
fragment was generated from template vector pAZ1 by fusion PCR encoding a T7
promoter region and the signal sequence of the E. coli outer membrane protein F
fused in frame to two tandem E. coli codon-optimized mature hIL-10 genes
connected via a 45 nucleotide linker sequence. The construct was cloned into
pUC19 for high-level expression in E. coli BL21 (DE3). The mean concentrations of
hIL-10 fusion protein in the periplasm and supernatant of E. coli at 37 °C growth
temperature were 130 ± 40 and 2 ± 1 ng/ml, respectively. The molecular mass of
the recombinant protein was assessed via matrix-assisted laser desorption
ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) analysis, indicating correct processing of 
the signaling sequence in E. coli. In vitro biological activity was shown by
phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription protein 3 and
suppression of tumor necrosis factor α secretion in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated
macrophages.

Most of the risk loci identified from genome-wide association (GWA) studies do
not provide direct information on the biological basis of a disease or on the
underlying mechanisms. Recent expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL)
association studies have provided information on genetic factors associated with 
gene expression variation. These eQTLs might contribute to phenotype diversity
and disease susceptibility, but interpretation is handicapped by low
reproducibility of the expression results. To address this issue, we have
generated a set of consensus eQTLs by integrating publicly available data for
specific human populations and cell types. Overall, we find over 4000 genes that 
are involved in high-confidence eQTL relationships. To elucidate the role that
eQTLs play in human common diseases, we matched the high-confidence eQTLs to a
set of 335 disease risk loci identified from the Wellcome Trust Case Control
Consortium GWA study and follow-up studies for 7 human complex trait
diseases-bipolar disorder (BD), coronary artery disease (CAD), Crohn's disease
(CD), hypertension (HT), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), type 1 diabetes (T1D), and
type 2 diabetes (T2D). The results show that the data are consistent with ∼50% of
these disease loci arising from an underlying expression change mechanism.

BACKGROUND: Personalised medicine, including biomarkers for treatment selection, 
may provide new algorithms for more effective treatment of patients. Genetic
variation may impact drug response and genetic markers could help selecting the
best treatment strategy for the individual patient.
AIM: To identify polymorphisms and candidate genes from the literature that are
associated with anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) treatment response in patients 
with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative
colitis.
METHODS: We performed a PubMed literature search and retrieved studies reporting 
original data on association between polymorphisms and anti-TNF treatment
response and conducted a meta-analysis.
RESULTS: A functional polymorphism in FCGR3A was significantly associated with
anti-TNF treatment response among CD patients using biological response criterion
(decrease in C-reactive protein, levels). Meta-analyses showed that polymorphisms
in TLR2 (rs3804099, OR (95% CI) = 2.17 (1.35-3.47)], rs11938228 [OR = 0.64
(0.43-0.96)], TLR4 (rs5030728) [OR = 3.18 (1.63-6.21)], TLR9 (rs352139) [OR =
0.43 (0.21-0.88)], TNFRSF1A (rs4149570) [OR = 2.06 (1.02-4.17)], IFNG (rs2430561)
[OR = 1.66 (1.05-2.63)], IL6 (rs10499563) [OR = 1.65 (1.04-2.63)] and IL1B
(rs4848306) [OR = 1.88 (1.05-3.35)] were significantly associated with response
among IBD patients using clinical response criteria. A positive predictive value 
of 0.96 was achieved by combining five genetic markers in an explorative
analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: There are no genetic markers currently available which are
adequately predictive of anti-TNF response for use in the clinic. Genetic markers
bear the advantage that they do not change over time. Therefore, hypothesis-free 
approaches, testing a large number of polymorphisms in large, well-characterised 
cohorts, are required in order to identify genetic profiles with larger effect
sizes, which could be employed as biomarkers for treatment selection in clinical 
settings.

BACKGROUND: Clinical observations or animal studies implicate enteric glial cells
in motility disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease,
gastrointestinal (GI) infections, postoperative ileus, and slow transit
constipation. Mechanisms underlying glial responses to inflammation in human GI
tract are not understood. Our goal was to identify the "reactive human enteric
glial cell (rhEGC) phenotype" induced by inflammation, and probe its functional
relevance.
METHODS: Human enteric glial cells in culture from 15 GI-surgical specimens were 
used to study gene expression, Ca, and purinergic signaling by Ca/fluo-4 imaging 
and mechanosensitivity. A nanostring panel of 107 genes was designed as a read
out of inflammation, transcription, purinergic signaling, vesicular transport
protein, channel, antioxidant, and other pathways. A 24-hour treatment with
lipopolysaccharide (200 μg/mL) and interferon-γ (10 μg/mL) was used to induce
inflammation and study molecular signaling, flow-dependent Ca responses from 3
mL/min to 10 mL/min, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) release, and ATP responses.
RESULTS: Treatment induced a "rhEGC phenotype" and caused up-regulation in
messenger RNA transcripts of 58% of 107 genes analyzed. Regulated genes included 
inflammatory genes (54%/IP10; IFN-γ; CxCl2; CCL3; CCL2; C3; s100B; IL-1β; IL-2R; 
TNF-α; IL-4; IL-6; IL-8; IL-10; IL-12A; IL-17A; IL-22; and IL-33), purine-genes
(52%/AdoR2A; AdoR2B; P2RY1; P2RY2; P2RY6; P2RX3; P2RX7; AMPD3; ENTPD2; ENTPD3;
and NADSYN1), channels (40%/Panx1; CHRNA7; TRPV1; and TRPA1), vesicular
transporters (SYT1, SYT2, SNAP25, and SYP), transcription factors (relA/relB,
SOCS3, STAT3, GATA_3, and FOXP3), growth factors (IGFBP5 and GMCSF), antioxidant 
genes (SOD2 and HMOX1), and enzymes (NOS2; TPH2; and CASP3) (P < 0.0001).
Treatment disrupted Ca signaling, ATP, and mechanical/flow-dependent Ca responses
in human enteric glial cells. ATP release increased 5-fold and s100B decreased
33%.
CONCLUSIONS: The "rhEGC phenotype" is identified by a complex cascade of
pro-inflammatory pathways leading to alterations of important molecular and
functional signaling pathways (Ca, purinergic, and mechanosensory) that could
disrupt GI motility. Inflammation induced a "purinergic switch" from ATP to
adenosine diphosphate/adenosine/uridine triphosphate signaling. Findings have
implications for GI infection, inflammatory bowel disease, postoperative ileus,
motility, and GI disorders.

BACKGROUND: Body mass index [BMI] is widely used to measure nutritional status in
Crohn's disease [CD] patients, but limitations remain. Measuring handgrip
strength index, in addition to BMI, may aid in overcoming limitations.
METHODS: A total of 150 patients with CD and 254 controls were included in this
study. All patients and controls underwent BMI, handgrip strength and
bioelectrical impedance analysis. Bioelectrical impedance analysis included body 
cell mass, bone mineral content, skeletal muscle mass and body fat mass. A total 
of 88 CD patients were age-, sex- and BMI-matched with healthy controls for
further analysis.
RESULTS: BMI, body cell mass, body cell mass index, handgrip strength and
handgrip strength index were all significantly decreased in the group of CD
patients compared with controls [p < 0.0001]. When paired by BMI, healthy
controls had significantly increased body cell mass index[p = 0.0344] and
handgrip strength index [p = 0.0010] compared to patients. In addition, handgrip 
strength was well correlated with body cell mass [r = 0.8365, p < 0.0001].
CONCLUSIONS: BMI is widely used for detecting malnutrition, but it is less
sensitive in predicting loss of body cell mass and skeletal muscle mass. Our
study shows that handgrip strength index is an effective and convenient parameter
to predict the functional nutritional status and muscular health in CD patients.

OBJECTIVE: The early identification of primary non-response to anti-TNFα therapy 
facilitates the timely management of patients with Crohn's disease (CD). A
recent, pilot study to detect prognostic markers of early response to anti-TNFα
therapy identified the two genes coding for the calprotectin subunits (S100A8,
S100A9) to be among the most highly expressed gene transcripts in non-responders.
This study tests the hypothesis that measurements of faecal calprotectin (FCAL)
pre- and post-anti-TNFα induction can predict primary non-response.
METHODS: Retrospective study of 32 CD patients treated over a two-year period.
Outcomes were assessed at 6 months based on clinical activity scores and the use 
of corticosteroids: (a) remission: Harvey-Bradshaw index (HBI) < 5, off
corticosteroids >2 months; (b) response: drop in HBI >3, off corticosteroids; (c)
non-response: ΔFCAL (and ΔCRP, respectively) was calculated as (FCAL
post-induction - FCAL pre-induction) × 100/FCAL pre induction.
RESULTS: At 6 months, 23 (72%) patients had responded (median (interquartile
range) HBI: 4 (3-5), FCAL: 55 (27-146)), 17 (73%) of whom were in remission [HBI:
3 (2.5-4) and FCAL: 42 (16-115)]. There was a significant difference in the ΔFCAL
from baseline to post-induction in the three groups (p < 0.0001). Comparing
non-responders to combined response and remission groups, the AUC of ΔFCAL to
predict outcome at 6 months was 0.97. Using ROC analysis, a Δ70% returned a
sensitivity and specificity of 99% and 96%, respectively (likelihood ratio,
LR= 23). ΔCRP did not predict 6 months outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: A drop in FCAL <70% after induction predicts primary non-response to
anti-TNFα in CD.

BACKGROUND: Comparative analysis of gut microbiomes in clinical studies of human 
diseases typically rely on identification and quantification of species or genes.
In addition to exploring specific functional characteristics of the microbiome
and potential significance of species diversity or expansion, microbiome
similarity is also calculated to study change in response to therapies directed
at altering the microbiome. Established ecological measures of similarity can be 
constructed from species abundances, however methods for calculating these
commonly used ecological measures of similarity directly from whole genome
shotgun (WGS) metagenomic sequence are lacking.
RESULTS: We present an alignment-free method for calculating similarity of WGS
metagenomic sequences that is analogous to the Bray-Curtis index for species,
implemented by the General Utility for Testing Sequence Similarity (GUTSS)
software application. This method was applied to intestinal microbiomes of
healthy young children to measure developmental changes toward an adult
microbiome during the first 3 years of life. We also calculate similarity of
donor and recipient microbiomes to measure establishment, or engraftment, of
donor microbiota in fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) studies focused on
mild to moderate Crohn's disease. We show how a relative index of similarity to
donor can be calculated as a measure of change in a patient's microbiome toward
that of the donor in response to FMT.
CONCLUSION: Because clinical efficacy of the transplant procedure cannot be fully
evaluated without analysis methods to quantify actual FMT engraftment, we
developed a method for detecting change in the gut microbiome that is independent
of species identification and database bias, sensitive to changes in relative
abundance of the microbial constituents, and can be formulated as an index for
correlating engraftment success with clinical measures of disease. More
generally, this method may be applied to clinical evaluation of human microbiomes
and provide potential diagnostic determination of individuals who may be
candidates for specific therapies directed at alteration of the microbiome.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a complex, multifactorial, chronic
inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract in which immune dysregulation
caused by genetic and/or environmental factors plays an important role. The aim
of this case-control study was to evaluate the association of tumor necrosis
factor-alpha (TNF-α) (308) and -β (+252) polymorphisms with susceptibility of
IBD. A total of 379 Saudi subjects including 179 IBD patients (ulcerative colitis
(UC) =84 and Crohn's disease (CD) =95) and 200 age- and sex-matched healthy
controls were recruited. TNF-α and TNF-β genes were amplified using an
amplification refractory mutation systems polymerase chain reaction methodology
to detect TNF-α (-308) and -β (+252) polymorphisms. The frequency of the GA
genotype of TNF-α (-308G/A) was higher, and the frequencies of the GG and AA
genotypes were significantly lower in IBD patients compared with those in
controls, indicating that genotype GA-positive individuals are susceptible to IBD
and that the GG and AA genotypes exert a protective effect. The frequency of
allele A of TNF-α (-308G/A) was significantly higher and that of allele G was
lower in IBD patients compared with those in controls, indicating an association 
of allele A with IBD risk in Saudi patients. On stratification of IBD patients
into UC and CD, an almost similar pattern was noticed in both the groups. The
results of TNF-β (+252A/G) polymorphisms showed a significant increase in the
frequency of the GG genotype in IBD patients, suggesting a positive association
of GG genotype with IBD risk. On stratification of IBD patients into UC and CD,
the genotype GG of TNF-β was associated with susceptibility risk to UC but not
CD. The frequencies of alleles and genotypes of both TNF-α and-β polymorphisms
are not affected by sex or type of IBD (familial or sporadic). TNF-α (-308G/A)
and TNF-β (+252A/G) polymorphisms are associated with risk of developing IBD in
Saudi population.

N(6)-Methyladenosine (m(6)A) is a widespread, reversible chemical modification of
RNA molecules, implicated in many aspects of RNA metabolism. Little quantitative 
information exists as to either how many transcript copies of particular genes
are m(6)A modified ('m(6)A levels') or the relationship of m(6)A modification(s) 
to alternative RNA isoforms. To deconvolute the m(6)A epitranscriptome, we
developed m(6)A-level and isoform-characterization sequencing (m(6)A-LAIC-seq).
We found that cells exhibit a broad range of nonstoichiometric m(6)A levels with 
cell-type specificity. At the level of isoform characterization, we discovered
widespread differences in the use of tandem alternative polyadenylation (APA)
sites by methylated and nonmethylated transcript isoforms of individual genes.
Strikingly, there is a strong bias for methylated transcripts to be coupled with 
proximal APA sites, resulting in shortened 3' untranslated regions, while
nonmethylated transcript isoforms tend to use distal APA sites. m(6)A-LAIC-seq
yields a new perspective on transcriptome complexity and links APA usage to m(6)A
modifications.

The mucosal immune system is unique to the gastrointestinal mucosa, in which a
large number of immune cells are located and exert multiple functions. Meanwhile,
~100 trillion microorganisms are thought to co-inhabit in the gastrointestinal
tract. Furthermore, immune cells and gut microbiota have a mutual influence and
the maintenance of this symbiotic relationship results in gut homeostasis. A
recent study suggested that a disturbance of gut microbiota-so called
"dysbiosis"-is related to various diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD) and colitis-associated cancer (CAC). In this review, we discuss the
relationship between gut microbiota and the mucosal immune system with regard to 
the development of IBD and CAC. In addition, we elucidate the possibility of
probiotics in treatment against these diseases.

AIM: To perform sequencing analysis in patients with very early-onset
inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD) to determine the genetic basis for VEO-IBD
in Chinese pediatric patients.
METHODS: A total of 13 Chinese pediatric patients with VEO-IBD were diagnosed
from May 2012 and August 2014. The relevant clinical characteristics of these
patients were analyzed. Then DNA in the peripheral blood from patients was
extracted. Next generation sequencing (NGS) based on an Illumina-Miseq platform
was used to analyze the exons in the coding regions of 10 candidate genes: IL-10,
IL-10RA, IL-10RB, NOD2, FUT2, IL23R, GPR35, GPR65, TNFSF15, and ADAM30. The
Sanger sequencing was used to verify the variations detected in NGS.
RESULTS: Out of the 13 pediatric patients, ten were diagnosed with Crohn's
disease, and three diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. Mutations in IL-10RA and
IL-10RB were detected in five patients. There were four patients who had single
nucleotide polymorphisms associated with IBD. Two patients had IL-10RA and FUT2
polymorphisms, and two patients had IL-10RB and FUT2 polymorphisms. Gene
variations were not found in the rest four patients. Children with mutations had 
lower percentile body weight (1.0% vs 27.5%, P = 0.002) and hemoglobin (87.4 g/L 
vs 108.5 g/L, P = 0.040) when compared with children without mutations. Although 
the age of onset was earlier, height was shorter, and the response to treatment
was poorer in the mutation group, there was no significant difference in these
factors between groups.
CONCLUSION: IL-10RA and IL-10RB mutations are common in Chinese children with
VEO-IBD. Patients with mutations have an earlier disease onset, lower body weight
and hemoglobin, and poorer prognosis.

Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is one of the most common types of cancer worldwide
and the prognosis for CRC patients with recurrence or metastasis is extremely
poor. Although chemotherapy and radiation therapy can improve survival, there are
still numerous efforts to be performed. Immunotherapy is frequently used, either 
alone or in combination with other therapies, for the treatment of CRC and is a
safe and feasible way to improve CRC treatment. Furthermore, the significance of 
the immune system in the biology of CRC has been demonstrated by retrospective
assessments of immune infiltrates in resected CRC tumors. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 
short, non-coding RNAs that can regulate multiple target genes at the
post-transcriptional level and play critical roles in cell proliferation,
differentiation and apoptosis. MiRNAs are required for normal immune system
development and function. Nevertheless, aberrant expression of miRNAs is often
observed in various tumor types and leads to immune disorders or immune evasion. 
The immunomodulatory function of miRNAs indicates that miRNAs may ultimately be
part of the portfolio of anti-cancer targets. Herein, we will review the
potential roles of miRNAs in the regulation of the immune response in CRC and
then move on to discuss how to utilize different miRNA targets to treat CRC. We
also provide an overview of the major limitations and challenges of using miRNAs 
as immunotherapeutic targets.

OBJECTIVES: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified loci
reproducibly associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and other
immune-mediated diseases; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying most of
genetic susceptibility remain undefined. Expressional quantitative trait loci
(eQTL) of disease-relevant tissue can be employed in order to elucidate the genes
and pathways affected by disease-specific genetic variance.
METHODS: In this study, we derived eQTLs for human whole blood and intestine
tissues of anti-tumor necrosis factor-resistant Crohn's disease (CD) patients. We
interpreted these eQTLs in the context of published IBD GWAS hits to inform on
the disease process.
RESULTS: At 10% false discovery rate, we discovered that 5,174 genes in blood and
2,063 genes in the intestine were controlled by a nearby single-nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) (i.e., cis-eQTL), among which 1,360 were shared between the
two tissues. A large fraction of the identified eQTLs were supported by the
regulomeDB database, showing that the eQTLs reside in regulatory elements (odds
ratio; OR=3.44 and 3.24 for blood and intestine eQTLs, respectively) as opposed
to protein-coding regions. Published IBD GWAS hits as a whole were enriched for
blood and intestine eQTLs (OR=2.88 and 2.05; and P value=2.51E-9 and 0.013,
respectively), thereby linking genetic susceptibility to control of gene
expression in these tissues. Through a systematic search, we used eQTL data to
inform 109 out of 372 IBD GWAS SNPs documented in National Human Genome Research 
Institute catalog, and we categorized the genes influenced by eQTLs according to 
their functions. Many of these genes have experimentally validated roles in
specific cell types contributing to intestinal inflammation.
CONCLUSIONS: The blood and intestine eQTLs described in this study represent a
powerful tool to link GWAS loci to a regulatory function and thus elucidate the
mechanisms underlying the genetic loci associated with IBD and related
conditions. Overall, our eQTL discovery approach empirically identifies the
disease-associated variants including their impact on the direction and extent of
expression changes in the context of disease-relevant cellular pathways in order 
to infer the functional outcome of this aspect of genetic susceptibility.

Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) is an enzyme that converts thiopurine drugs
into inactive metabolites. Over 20 variant TPMT-encoding alleles, which cause
reduced enzymatic activity, have been discovered so far. Our aim was to
investigate the frequencies of variant alleles, i.e. genotypes in inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD) patients and healthy individuals and to compare these
frequencies with selected world populations. The most common variant alleles
TPMT*2, TPMT*3A, TPMT*3B and TPMT*3C were analyzed with polymerase chain
reaction-based assays and allele-specific polymerase chain reaction-based assays 
in 685 participants including 459 IBD patients and 226 healthy volunteers. Study 
results revealed 434/459 (94.55%) IBD patients and 213/226 (94.25%) healthy
subjects to be homozygous for the wild-type allele (TPMT*1/*1). TPMT*1/*2 and
TPMT *1/*3C genotypes were found in 4/459 (0.87%) and 7/459 (1.53%) IBD patients,
respectively; in healthy volunteers they were not found. TPMT*1/*3A genotype was 
found in 14/459 (3.05%) IBD patients and 13/226 (5.75%) healthy subjects. Variant
genotypes were statistically significantly more common in Crohn's disease
subgroup than in ulcerative colitis subgroup. The prevalence of variant genotypes
was 23/338 (6.80%) in Crohn's disease subgroup as compared with 2/121 (1.65%) in 
ulcerative colitis subgroup (χ2 = 4.59; p = 0.032). In conclusion, the most
frequently occurring nonfunctional TPMT allele in Croatian population is TPMT*3A.
The overall frequency of mutant alleles in our population is statistically
nonsignificantly lower when compared with other populations of Caucasian origin. 
The Crohn's disease group had more mutant alleles than the ulcerative colitis
group.

BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents a family of diseases
including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. IBD has garnered significant
attention in recent years due to successes in 2 areas of basic science: complex
human genetics and host-microbe interactions. Advances in understanding the
genetics of IBD, mainly driven by genome-wide association studies, have
identified more than 160 genetic loci that modulate the risk of disease. Notably,
several of these genes have pointed to alterations in host-microbe interactions
as being critical factors in pathogenesis. Investigations into the microbial
communities of the gastrointestinal tract (or the 'gut microbiome') in IBD have
yielded important insights into several aspects of interactions between
microbiota and the host immune system, including how alterations to microbial
community composition and function have important consequences for immune
homeostasis.
KEY MESSAGES: The anatomy of the gastrointestinal tract plays a role in defining 
not only intestinal function, but also the microbial ecosystem that lives within 
the gut. Careful investigations into the composition and function of these
microbial communities have suggested that patients with IBD have an imbalance in 
their gut microbiota, termed dysbiosis. These studies, as well as studies using
samples from healthy individuals, have begun to uncover mechanisms of crosstalk
between particular microbes (and microbial products) and immunomodulatory
pathways, alterations which may drive immune diseases such as IBD.
CONCLUSIONS: Investigations into the role of the microbiome in IBD have provided 
important clues to potential pathogenic mechanisms. Harnessing this knowledge to 
develop therapeutics and identify biomarkers is currently a major translational
goal, holding great promise for clinically meaningful progress.

BACKGROUND: Numerous genetic and environmental risk factors play a role in human 
complex genetic disorders (CGD). However, their complex interplay remains to be
modelled and explained in terms of disease mechanisms.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Crohn's Disease (CD) was modeled as a modular network of
patho-physiological functions, each summarizing multiple gene-gene and
gene-environment interactions. The disease resulted from one or few specific
combinations of module functional states. Network aging dynamics was able to
reproduce age-specific CD incidence curves as well as their variations over the
past century in Western countries. Within the model, we translated the odds
ratios (OR) associated to at-risk alleles in terms of disease propensities of the
functional modules. Finally, the model was successfully applied to other CGD
including ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis and
schizophrenia.
CONCLUSION: Modeling disease incidence may help to understand disease causative
chains, to delineate the potential of personalized medicine, and to monitor
epidemiological changes in CGD.

The real pathophysiology of Crohn's disease is unknown. The higher prevalence of 
Crohn's disease in Caucasian and Jewish ethnicities, as well as its familial
aggregation and higher concordance among monozygotic twins, suggest some roles
for genes in its development, clinical progression, and outcome. Recent original 
studies have indicated DLG5113G/A gene polymorphism as a risk factor for Crohn's 
disease. Meanwhile, the results of these studies are not consistent. We performed
the current meta-analysis to understand whether there is any association between 
DLG5 gene polymorphism and the risk of Crohn's disease. PubMed was searched to
find the case-control studies on DLG5 gene polymorphisms and Crohn's disease.
This search compiled 65 articles and based on our criteria. 11 articles were
included in this meta-analysis. The association between the DLG5 113G/A
polymorphism and the risk of disease was assessed using odds ratio (OR) and 95%
confidence interval (95% CI). Heterogeneity was evaluated based on I2 values. 
Random and fixed-effect models were used when I2>50% and I2≤50%, respectively.
Eleven studies with a total of 4648 cases and 5677 controls were pooled. Based on
our meta-analysis, DLG5113G/A gene polymorphism both at genotypic and allelic
levels were not associated with the risk of Crohn's disease. Pooled data
indicated no significant association between DLG5113G/A gene polymorphism and the
development of Crohn's disease. In order to achieve a superior conclusion,
multicenter studies on larger number of patients are recommended.

The polymeric IgR (pIgR) is a central component in the transport of IgA across
enterocytes and thereby plays a crucial role in the defense against
enteropathogens and in the regulation of circulating IgA levels. The present
study was performed to address the novel regulation of pIgR expression in
intestinal epithelia undergoing ribosome inactivation. Insults to mucosa that led
to ribosome inactivation attenuated pIgR expression in enterocytes. However, IFN 
regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) as a central transcription factor of pIgR induction
was superinduced by ribosome inactivation in the presence of IFN-γ as a result of
mRNA stabilization by the RNA-binding protein HuR. Another important
transcription factor for pIgR expression, NF-κB, was marginally involved in
suppression of pIgR by ribosome inactivation. In contrast to a positive
contribution of HuR in early induction of IRF-1 expression, extended exposure to 
ribosome inactivation caused nuclear entrapment of HuR, resulting in
destabilization of late-phase-induced pIgR mRNA. These HuR-linked differential
regulations of pIgR and of IRF-1 led to a reduced mucosal secretion of IgA and,
paradoxically, an induction of IRF-1-activated target genes, including
colitis-associated IL-7. Therefore, these events can account for ribosome
inactivation-related mucosal disorders and provide new insight into interventions
for HuR-linked pathogenesis in diverse mucosa-associated diseases, including
inflammatory bowel disease and IgA nephritis.

Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) and inosine triphosphatase (ITPA) are crucial
enzymes involved in the metabolism of thiopurine drugs: azathioprine and
6-mercaptopurine, used in the treatment of leukemia or inflammatory bowel
diseases (IBD). The activity in these enzymes correlates with the genetic
polymorphism of the TPMT and ITPA genes, respectively, which determines an
individual reaction and dosing of thiopurines. Three main TPMT alleles: TPMT*2
(c.238G>C), TPMT*3A (c.460G>A, c.719A>G) and TPMT*3C (c.719A>G) account for
80-95 % of inherited TPMT deficiency in different populations in the world. In
the ITPA gene, a c.94C>A mutation is significantly associated with an adverse
thiopurine reaction. The aim of this study was to develop a quick and highly
sensitive method for determining major TPMT and ITPA alleles. Here we present the
molecular test for genotyping c.238G>C, c.460G>A, c.719A>G and c.94C>A changes
based on multiplex high resolution melting analysis (HRMA). We analyzed DNA
samples from 100 clinically diagnosed IBD patients treated with thiopurine drugs,
and a known genotype in the positions 238, 460 and 719 of the TPMT gene as well
as in position 94 of the ITPA gene. Our results obtained with multiplex HRMA
indicated 100 % accuracy in comparison with data from restriction fragments
length polymorphism (RFLP) and standard DNA sequencing. We conclude, that
multiplex HRMA can be used as a quick, sensitive and efficient alternative
diagnostic method compared to conventional techniques for the determination of
TPMT*2, TPMT*3A and TPMT*3C alleles and c.94C>A change in the ITPA gene.

The gut microbial community is dynamic during the first 3 years of life, before
stabilizing to an adult-like state. However, little is known about the impact of 
environmental factors on the developing human gut microbiome. We report a
longitudinal study of the gut microbiome based on DNA sequence analysis of
monthly stool samples and clinical information from 39 children, about half of
whom received multiple courses of antibiotics during the first 3 years of life.
Whereas the gut microbiome of most children born by vaginal delivery was
dominated by Bacteroides species, the four children born by cesarean section and 
about 20% of vaginally born children lacked Bacteroides in the first 6 to 18
months of life. Longitudinal sampling, coupled with whole-genome shotgun
sequencing, allowed detection of strain-level variation as well as the abundance 
of antibiotic resistance genes. The microbiota of antibiotic-treated children was
less diverse in terms of both bacterial species and strains, with some species
often dominated by single strains. In addition, we observed short-term
composition changes between consecutive samples from children treated with
antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance genes carried on microbial chromosomes showed 
a peak in abundance after antibiotic treatment followed by a sharp decline,
whereas some genes carried on mobile elements persisted longer after antibiotic
therapy ended. Our results highlight the value of high-density longitudinal
sampling studies with high-resolution strain profiling for studying the
establishment and response to perturbation of the infant gut microbiome.

The role of the microbiome in health and disease is attracting great attention,
yet we still know little about some of the most prevalent microorganisms inside
our bodies. Several years ago, Human Microbiome Project (HMP) researchers
generated a list of "most wanted" taxa: bacteria both prevalent among healthy
volunteers and distantly related to any sequenced organisms. Unfortunately, the
challenge of assembling high-quality genomes from a tangle of metagenomic reads
has slowed progress in learning about these uncultured bacteria. Here, we
describe how recent advances in sequencing and analysis allowed us to assemble
"most wanted" genomes from metagenomic data collected from four stool samples.
Using a combination of both de novo and guided assembly methods, we assembled and
binned over 100 genomes from an initial data set of over 1,300 Gbp. One of these 
genome bins, which met HMP's criteria for a "most wanted" taxa, contained three
essentially complete genomes belonging to a previously uncultivated species. This
species is most closely related to Eubacterium desmolans and the clostridial
cluster IV/Clostridium leptum subgroup species Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum
(71-76% average nucleotide identity). Gene function analysis indicates that the
species is an obligate anaerobe, forms spores, and produces the anti-inflammatory
short-chain fatty acids acetate and butyrate. It also appears to take up
metabolically costly molecules such as cobalamin, methionine, and branch-chained 
amino acids from the environment, and to lack virulence genes. Thus, the evidence
is consistent with a secondary degrader that occupies a host-dependent,
nutrient-scavenging niche within the gut; its ability to produce butyrate, which 
is thought to play an anti-inflammatory role, makes it intriguing for the study
of diseases such as colon cancer and inflammatory bowel disease. In conclusion,
we have assembled essentially complete genomes from stool metagenomic data,
yielding valuable information about uncultured organisms' metabolic and ecologic 
niches, factors that may be required to successfully culture these bacteria, and 
their role in maintaining health and causing disease.

Although numerous polymorphisms have been associated with inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD), identifying the function of these genetic factors has proved
challenging. Here we identified a role for nine genes in IBD susceptibility loci 
in antibacterial autophagy and characterized a role for one of these genes,
GPR65, in maintaining lysosome function. Mice lacking Gpr65, a proton-sensing G
protein-coupled receptor, showed increased susceptibly to bacteria-induced
colitis. Epithelial cells and macrophages lacking GPR65 exhibited impaired
clearance of intracellular bacteria and accumulation of aberrant lysosomes.
Similarly, IBD patient cells and epithelial cells expressing an IBD-associated
missense variant, GPR65 I231L, displayed aberrant lysosomal pH resulting in
lysosomal dysfunction, impaired bacterial restriction, and altered lipid droplet 
formation. The GPR65 I231L polymorphism was sufficient to confer decreased GPR65 
signaling. Collectively, these data establish a role for GPR65 in IBD
susceptibility and identify lysosomal dysfunction as a potentially causative
element in IBD pathogenesis with effects on cellular homeostasis and defense.

BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder belonging to 
the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). CD affects distinct parts of the
gastrointestinal tract, leading to symptoms including diarrhea, fever, abdominal 
pain, weight loss, and anemia. The aim of this study was to assess whether the
DNA methylome of peripheral blood cells can be associated with CD in women.
METHODS: Samples were obtained from 18 female patients with histologically
confirmed ileal or ileocolic CD and 25 healthy age- and gender-matched controls
(mean age and standard deviation: 30.5 ± 6.5 years for both groups). Genome-wide 
DNA methylation was determined using the Illumina HumanMethylation 450k BeadChip.
RESULTS: Our analysis implicated 4287 differentially methylated positions (DMPs; 
corrected p < 0.05) that are associated to 2715 unique genes. Gene ontology
enrichment analysis revealed significant enrichment of our DMPs in immune
response processes and inflammatory pathways. Of the 4287 DMPs, 32 DMPs were
located on chromosome X with several hits for MIR223 and PABPC5. Comparison with 
previously performed (epi)genome-wide studies revealed that we replicated 33
IBD-associated genes. In addition to DMPs, we found eight differentially
methylated regions (DMRs).
CONCLUSIONS: CD patients display a characteristic DNA methylation landscape, with
the differentially methylated genes being implicated in immune response.
Additionally, DMPs were found on chromosome X suggesting X-linked manifestations 
of CD that could be associated with female-specific symptoms.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to identify the altered biological pathways
associated with ulcerative colitis (UC)-related colorectal carcinoma (CRC) by
systematic tracking the dysregulated modules from re-weighted protein- protein
interaction (PPI) networks based on the expression profiles from normal, UC and
various stages of CRC.
METHODS: We firstly recruited the UC- and CRC-related microarray data from
ArrayExpress database, and obtained 8 expression profiles which contained 5
conditions (normal, UC, early stage CRC, stage II CRC and stage III CRC). Then,
the PPI networks of normal and different disease stages were constructed and
re-weighted using Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC). Next, the
condition-specific modules were extracted from 5 PPI networks via clique-merging 
algorithm, and altered modules were captured on the basis of module correlation
density (MCD). Subsequently, the gene compositions of altered modules and gene
differential expressions in different disease stages were identified to screen
the dysregulated genes. Finally, pathways enrichment analyses for the genes in
altered modules and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were implemented.
RESULTS: The extensive changes of gene correlations existed in 5
condition-specific PPI networks, which made different MCDs among different
disease stages. The same number of modules (N=1952) were explored in 5 PPI
networks. By comparing with normal condition, there were 463, 791, 1060 and 345
altered modules in UC, early stage CRC, stage II and III CRC, respectively.
Overall, 77, 110, 170 and 110 common genes were identified between genes of
altered modules and DEGs in UC, early stage CRC, stage II CRC and stage III CRC, 
respectively. Functional enrichment analyses indicated that cell cycle and oocyte
meiosis were the common and most significant pathways in colonic diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: Tracking the altered modules from PPI networks is useful to uncover 
disrupted pathways in colonic diseases. Cell cycle and oocyte meiosis might be
associated with the pathophysiological background of colonic diseases.

caspase cleavage. Here we show that T300A also alters the ability of the
C-terminal WD40-repeat domain of ATG16L1 to interact with an amino acid motif
that recognizes this region. Such alteration impairs the unconventional
autophagic activity of TMEM59, a transmembrane protein that contains the WD40
domain-binding motif, and disrupts its normal intracellular trafficking and its
ability to engage ATG16L1 in response to bacterial infection. TMEM59-induced
autophagy is blunted in cells expressing the fragments generated by caspase
processing of the ATG16L1-T300A risk allele, whereas canonical autophagy remains 
unaffected. These results suggest that the T300A polymorphism alters the function
of motif-containing molecules that engage ATG16L1 through the WD40 domain, either
by influencing this interaction under non-stressful conditions or by inhibiting
their downstream autophagic signalling after caspase-mediated cleavage.

BACKGROUND: Septic perianal Crohn's disease (SPCD) is a treatment challenge in
spite of tumor necrosis factor antagonists (anti-TNF). Our aim was to define the 
success of SPCD management with a combined medical and surgical approach and to
identify clinical and genetic factors predictive of healing.
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective chart review of patients with SPCD treated at the
Penn State Milton S Hershey Medical Center was done. Primary end point was
complete healing (ie normal clinical exam and no pain for at least 6 months).
Genetic analysis of 185 single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with Crohn's
disease was performed in 78 patients.
RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-five episodes of SPCD were identified in 114
patients with a mean follow-up of 77 ± 7.4 months. Overall, 80 of 135 episodes
healed (59.3%) and did not differ between those receiving anti-TNF and not (60.4%
vs 56.8%). There appeared to be a consistent improved heal rate in each
subcategory of surgically managed patients that received anti-TNF. Female sex was
significantly predictive of healing in only those receiving anti-TNF agents
(63.6% vs 25.0%; p = 0.0005). Twenty-two (19.3%) patients ultimately received a
permanent diversion with either a total proctocolectomy or completion
proctectomy. Multivariate analysis suggested several single nucleotide
polymorphisms in Crohn's disease-associated genes to be possibly associated with 
healing, but lost significance after Bonferroni correction.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, there is an approximate 60% rate of healing SPCD using a
combined medical and surgical approach. About 20% of SPCD patients will require a
permanent stoma. There were no clear genetic predictors of healing SPCD.

BACKGROUND: The nuclear hormone receptor RORγ regulates transcriptional genes
involved in the production of the pro-inflammatory interleukin IL-17 which has
been linked to autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple
sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease. This transcriptional activity of RORγ
is modulated through a protein-protein interaction involving the activation
function 2 (AF2) helix on the ligand binding domain of RORγ and a conserved LXXLL
helix motif on coactivator proteins. Our goal was to develop a RORγ specific
inverse agonist that would help down regulate pro-inflammatory gene transcription
by disrupting the protein protein interaction with coactivator proteins as a
therapeutic agent.
RESULTS: We identified a novel series of synthetic benzoxazinone ligands having
an agonist (BIO592) and inverse agonist (BIO399) mode of action in a FRET based
assay. We show that the AF2 helix of RORγ is proteolytically sensitive when
inverse agonist BIO399 binds. Using x-ray crystallography we show how small
modifications on the benzoxazinone agonist BIO592 trigger inverse agonism of
RORγ. Using an in vivo reporter assay, we show that the inverse agonist BIO399
displayed specificity for RORγ over ROR sub-family members α and β.
CONCLUSION: The synthetic benzoxazinone ligands identified in our FRET assay have
an agonist (BIO592) or inverse agonist (BIO399) effect by stabilizing or
destabilizing the agonist conformation of RORγ. The proteolytic sensitivity of
the AF2 helix of RORγ demonstrates that it destabilizes upon BIO399 inverse
agonist binding perturbing the coactivator protein binding site. Our structural
investigation of the BIO592 agonist and BIO399 inverse agonist structures
identified residue Met358 on RORγ as the trigger for RORγ specific inverse
agonism.

The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative
colitis, result in chronic inflammation to the gastrointestinal tract. In
ulcerative colitis, inflammation tends to be more superficial and restricted to
the colon; contrastingly, Crohn's disease presents as patchy, more penetrative
inflammation that can occur throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Other
differences between these diseases include the nature of their respective immune 
responses-Crohn's disease presents as a Th1 and ulcerative colitis as a Th2-type 
inflammation. During any inflammatory episode, metabolic demand on the tissue
increases accompanying the influx of inflammatory cells, increasing the demand
for ATP and oxygen. When availability of oxygen is limiting, tissues become
hypoxic, which results in adaptive pathways to enable survival of hypoxic
episodes. The primary pathway activated is the HIF (hypoxia inducible factor)
transcription factor, which regulates adaptive pathways including genes
controlling glycolytic metabolism and angiogenesis. In adequately oxygenated
tissues (i.e. normoxia), the HIF protein is constantly produced, but
oxygen-dependent enzymes called prolyl-hydroxylases utilize available oxygen to
hydroxylate HIF on proline residues, targeting it for ubiquitination and
subsequent degradation. Here we describe methods for inducing, visualizing, and
quantifying in vivo "inflammatory hypoxia," using the murine gut as a model
system.

A urease-negative, fusiform, novel bacterium named Helicobacter saguini was
isolated from the intestines and feces of cotton-top tamarins (CTTs) with chronic
colitis. Helicobacter sp. was detected in 69% of feces or intestinal samples from
116 CTTs. The draft genome sequence, obtained by Illumina MiSeq sequencing, for
H. saguini isolate MIT 97-6194-5, consisting of ∼2.9 Mb with a G+C content of 35%
and 2,704 genes, was annotated using the NCBI Prokaryotic Genomes Automatic
Annotation Pipeline. H. saguini contains homologous genes of known virulence
factors found in other enterohepatic helicobacter species (EHS) and H. pylori
These include flagellin, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (ggt), collagenase, the
secreted serine protease htrA, and components of a type VI secretion system, but 
the genome does not harbor genes for cytolethal distending toxin (cdt). H.
saguini MIT 97-6194-5 induced significant levels of interleukin-8 (IL-8) in HT-29
cell culture supernatants by 4 h, which increased through 24 h. mRNAs for the
proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), IL-10, and 
IL-6 and the chemokine CXCL1 were upregulated in cocultured HT-29 cells at 4 h
compared to levels in control cells. At 3 months postinfection, all H.
saguini-monoassociated gnotobiotic C57BL/129 IL-10(-/-) mice were colonized and
had seroconverted to H. saguini antigen with a significant Th1-associated
increase in IgG2c (P < 0.0001). H. saguini induced a significant typhlocolitis,
associated epithelial defects, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)
hyperplasia, and dysplasia. Inflammatory cytokines IL-22, IL-17a, IL-1β, gamma
interferon (IFN-γ), and TNF-α, as well as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) 
were significantly upregulated in the cecal tissues of infected mice. The
expression of the DNA damage response molecule γ-H2AX was significantly higher in
the ceca of H. saguini-infected gnotobiotic mice than in the controls. This model
using a nonhuman primate Helicobacter sp. can be used to study the pathogenic
potential of EHS isolated from primates with naturally occurring inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD) and colon cancer.

Salmonella infection in humans can become chronic, which leads to low-grade
persistent inflammation. These chronic infections increase the risk of several
gastrointestinal diseases, including cancer. Salmonella AvrA is a multifunctional
protein that influences eukaryotic cell pathways by regulating ubiquitination and
acetylation. In an animal model, we have demonstrated that infection with
AvrA-expressing Salmonella induces beta-catenin signals and enhances colonic
tumorigenesis. Beta-catenin signaling is a key player in intestinal proliferation
and tumorigenesis. The relative contributions of AvrA-induced proliferation and
inflammation on tumorigenesis, however, are unknown. STAT3 is activated in
chronically inflamed intestines in human inflammatory bowel diseases and in
colitis-associated colon cancer. In the current study, mice were colonized with
Salmonella AvrA-sufficient or AvrA-deficient bacterial strains. Then,
inflammation-associated colon cancer was induced through the use of
azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium. We determined that AvrA-expressing bacteria 
activated the STAT3 pathway, which is predicted to enhance proliferation and
promote tumorigenesis. Transcriptional activity of STAT3 and its target genes
were upregulated by Salmonella expressing AvrA, thus promoting proliferation and 
intestinal tumorigenesis. Our findings provide new insights regarding a
STAT3-dependent mechanism by which the specific bacterial product AvrA enhances
the development of infection-associated colon cancer. These insights might
suggest future biomarkers to risk assessment and early detection of
infection-related cancer.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with risk variants in the human
genome and dysbiosis of the gut microbiome, though unifying principles for these 
findings remain largely undescribed. The human commensal Bacteroides fragilis
delivers immunomodulatory molecules to immune cells via secretion of outer
membrane vesicles (OMVs). We reveal that OMVs require IBD-associated genes,
ATG16L1 and NOD2, to activate a noncanonical autophagy pathway during protection 
from colitis. ATG16L1-deficient dendritic cells do not induce regulatory T cells 
(T(regs)) to suppress mucosal inflammation. Immune cells from human subjects with
a major risk variant in ATG16L1 are defective in T(reg) responses to OMVs. We
propose that polymorphisms in susceptibility genes promote disease through
defects in "sensing" protective signals from the microbiome, defining a
potentially critical gene-environment etiology for IBD.

Type 1 interferon (IFN-1) promotes regulatory T-cell function to suppress
inflammation in the mouse intestine, but little is known about IFN-1 in the human
gut. We therefore assessed the influence of IFN-1 on CD4+ T-cells isolated from
human colon tissue obtained from healthy controls or patients with inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD). Immunofluorescent imaging revealed constitutive expression
of IFNβ in human intestinal tissue, and colonic T-cells were responsive to
exogenous IFN-1 as assessed by phosphorylation of signal transduction and
activator of transcription 1 (pSTAT1) and induction of interferon stimulated
genes (ISGs). Unlike their blood counterparts, intestinal T-cells from
non-inflamed regions of IBD colon displayed enhanced responsiveness to IFN-1,
increased frequency of pSTAT1+ cells, and greater induction of ISGs upon IFN-1
exposure in vitro. In healthy tissue, antibody neutralization of IFNβ selectively
reduced T-cell production of the pro-regulatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10)
and increased IFNγ synthesis. In contrast, neutralization of IFNβ in IBD tissue
cultures increased the frequency of T-cells producing inflammatory cytokines but 
did not alter IL-10 expression. These data support a role for endogenous IFN-1 as
a context-dependent modulator of T-cell function that promotes regulatory
activity in healthy human intestine, but indicate that the IFN-1/STAT1 pathway is
dysregulated in inflammatory bowel disease.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a toxic gas that has been recognized as an important
mediator of many physiological processes, such as neurodegeneration, regulation
of inflammation, blood pressure, and metabolism. In the human colon, H2S is
produced by both endogenous enzymes and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB). H2S is
involved in the physiological and pathophysiological conditions of the colon,
such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC), which makes
the pharmacological modulation of H2S production and metabolism a potential
chemical target for the treatment of colonic diseases. However, the exact
mechanisms and pathways by which H2S-mediates normal physiological function and
disease in the colon are not fully understood. Besides, the production and
release of H2S are modulated by both endogenous and exogenous factors. This
review will discuss the production and storage of H2S, its biological roles and
the emerging importance in physiology and pathology of IBD and CRC.

Although the association between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and oral
hygiene has been noticed before, there has been little research on prolonged
fluoride exposure as a possible risk factor. In the presented cases, exposure to 
fluoride seems indirectly associated with higher incidence of IBD. Fluoride
toxicology and epidemiology documents frequent unspecific chronic
gastrointestinal symptoms and intestinal inflammation. Efflux genes that confer
resistance to environmental fluoride may select for IBD associated gut microbiota
and therefore be involved in the pathogenesis. Together these multidisciplinary
results argue for further investigation on the hypothesis of fluoride as a risk
factor for IBD.

OBJECTIVE: Adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) are a leading candidate
bacterial trigger for Crohn's disease (CD). The AIEC pathovar is defined by in
vitro cell-line assays examining specific bacteria/cell interactions. No
molecular marker exists for their identification. Our aim was to identify a
molecular property common to the AIEC phenotype.
DESIGN: 41 B2 phylogroup E. coli strains were isolated from 36 Australian
subjects: 19 patients with IBD and 17 without. Adherence/invasion assays were
conducted using the I-407 epithelial cell line and survival/replication assays
using the THP-1 macrophage cell line. Cytokine secretion tumour necrosis factor
((TNF)-α, interleukin (IL) 6, IL-8 and IL-10) was measured using ELISA. The
genomes were assembled and annotated, and cluster analysis performed using
CD-HIT. The resulting matrices were analysed to identify genes unique/more
frequent in AIEC strains compared with non-AIEC strains. Base composition
differences and clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeat (CRISPR)
analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: Of all B2 phylogroup strains assessed, 79% could survive and replicate
in macrophages. Among them, 11/41 strains (5 CD, 2 UCs, 5 non-IBD) also adhere to
and invade epithelial cells, a phenotype assigning them to the AIEC pathovar. The
AIEC strains were phylogenetically heterogeneous. We did not identify a gene (or 
nucleic acid base composition differences) common to all, or the majority of,
AIEC. Cytokine secretion and CRISPRs were not associated with the AIEC phenotype.
CONCLUSIONS: Comparative genomic analysis of AIEC and non-AIEC strains did not
identify a molecular property exclusive to the AIEC phenotype. We recommend a
broader approach to the identification of the bacteria-host interactions that are
important in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease.

Genetic analysis in the IL10-deficient mouse model revealed a modifier locus of
experimental inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on chromosome 18, with the allele
of the strain C3H/HeJBir (C3Bir) conferring resistance and the allele of C57BL/6J
(B6) conferring susceptibility. Differential Cd14 expression was associated with 
this background specific susceptibility to intestinal inflammation. Polymorphisms
of the Cd14 promoter were found to be likely causative for strain specific
expression, and Cd14-knockout mice revealed a protective role of this
gene-product in experimental IBD. In this study, luciferase reporter assays
confirmed an increased activity of the C3Bir derived Cd14 promoter compared to
the one of B6. Promoter truncation experiments and site-directed mutagenesis in
both strains resulted in reduced Cd14 promoter activity and confirmed that a
central AP1 and the proximal SP1 transcription factor binding sites mediated the 
basal activity of the Cd14 promoter in the mouse. Moreover, a T to C exchange at 
position -259 replaced putative STAT1 and CDX1 sites in the Cd14 promoter from B6
by a SP2 site in C3Bir. Ablation of the Sp2 site through truncation was
associated with a decreased promoter activity. Site-directed mutagenesis also
demonstrated that the inactivation of SP2 led to a substantial loss of promoter
activity in C3Bir. Performing electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift
assays demonstrated interaction of SP2 with its potential binding site. In
addition, retroviral-mediated overexpression of the SP2 transcription factor in
primary bone marrow macrophages derived from C3Bir mice caused a significant
increase in Cd14 transcription. These data characterized SP2 as important factor 
responsible for higher Cd14 expression and reduced IBD susceptibility mediated by
the C3Bir allele.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a type of small noncoding RNA that can regulate the
expression of target genes under physiological and pathophysiological conditions.
miR-155 is a multifunctional miRNA with inflammation-related and oncogenic roles.
In particular, the dysregulation of miR-155 has been strongly implicated in
Helicobacter pylori-related gastric disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and
colorectal cancer in addition to being involved in molecular changes of important
targets and signaling pathways. This review focuses on the expression and
function of miR-155 during inflammation and carcinogenesis and its potential use 
as an effective therapeutic target for certain gastrointestinal diseases.

The mechanisms that tightly control the transcription of host defense genes have 
not been fully elucidated. We previously identified TFEB as a transcription
factor important for host defense, but the mechanisms that regulate TFEB during
infection remained unknown. Here, we used C. elegans to discover a pathway that
activates TFEB during infection. Gene dkf-1, which encodes a homolog of protein
kinase D (PKD), was required for TFEB activation in nematodes infected with
Staphylococcus aureus. Conversely, pharmacological activation of PKD
was sufficient to activate TFEB. Furthermore, phospholipase C (PLC) gene plc-1
was also required for TFEB activation, downstream of Gαq homolog egl-30 and
upstream of dkf-1. Using reverse and chemical genetics, we discovered a similar
PLC-PKD-TFEB axis in Salmonella-infected mouse macrophages. In addition, PKCα was
required in macrophages. These observations reveal a previously unknown host
defense signaling pathway, which has been conserved across one billion years of
evolution.

BACKGROUND: T helper (Th) and regulatory T (Treg) cell-related cytokines are
implicated in inflammatory bowel diseases, including ulcerative colitis (UC).
While these cytokines are generally upregulated in inflamed mucosae, the key
cytokine profile explaining disease severity has not been determined.
METHODS: The Rachmilewitz endoscopic index (REI) was assessed in 61 UC patients
undergoing colonoscopy. Biopsies obtained from inflamed (REI 3-12) and
noninflamed (REI 0-2) areas were analyzed by quantitative PCR for expression of
mRNAs encoding cytokines and transcription factors related to Th1 (TNF-α, IFN-γ, 
IL-12p35, IL-12p40, and T-bet), Th2 (IL-4, IL-13, IL-33, and GATA3), Th17
(IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, IL-22, IL-23p19, IL-6, and RORC), Th9 (IL-9, IRF4, and
PU.1), and Treg (TGF-β and Foxp3). Expression patterns associated with higher REI
were determined by univariate and multivariate analyses.
RESULTS: Despite general upregulation, none of these mRNAs showed univariate
correlation with REI in inflamed samples. Multiple regression analysis, however, 
found that joint expression of IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, RORC, and TGF-β was
significantly predictive of REI (P < 0.0002, R2 = 0.380), with major individual
contributions by IL-17A (P < 0.0001) and IL-17F (P < 0.0001), which were
associated with increased and decreased REI, respectively. Partial correlation
analysis, validating this model, indicated differences between IL-17A and IL-17F 
in correlating with other targets. The IL-17A/IL-17F ratio showed a significant
correlation with REI (r = 0.5124, P < 0.0001), whereas no other mRNAs were
essentially predictive of REI.
CONCLUSIONS: Mucosal IL-17A/IL-17F ratio significantly correlates with endoscopic
score in UC patients, accompanied by their disparate interactions with other
Th/Treg-related genes.

BACKGROUND: Fusobacterium nucleatum, a well studied bacterium in periodontal
diseases, appendicitis, gingivitis, osteomyelitis and pregnancy complications has
recently gained attention due to its association with colorectal cancer (CRC)
progression. Treatment with berberine was shown to reverse F. nucleatum-induced
CRC progression in mice by balancing the growth of opportunistic pathogens in
tumor microenvironment. Intestinal microbiota imbalance and the infections caused
by F. nucleatum might be regulated by therapeutic intervention. Hence, we aimed
to predict drug target proteins in F. nucleatum, through subtractive genomics
approach and host-pathogen protein-protein interactions (HP-PPIs). We also
carried out enrichment analysis of host interacting partners to hypothesize the
possible mechanisms involved in CRC progression due to F. nucleatum.
RESULTS: In subtractive genomics approach, the essential, virulence and
resistance related proteins were retrieved from RefSeq proteome of F. nucleatum
by searching against Database of Essential Genes (DEG), Virulence Factor Database
(VFDB) and Antibiotic Resistance Gene-ANNOTation (ARG-ANNOT) tool respectively. A
subsequent hierarchical screening to identify non-human homologous, metabolic
pathway-independent/pathway-specific and druggable proteins resulted in eight
pathway-independent and 27 pathway-specific druggable targets. Co-aggregation of 
F. nucleatum with host induces proinflammatory gene expression thereby
potentiates tumorigenesis. Hence, proteins from IBDsite, a database for
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) research and those involved in colorectal
adenocarcinoma as interpreted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were retrieved 
to predict drug targets based on HP-PPIs with F. nucleatum proteome. Prediction
of HP-PPIs exhibited 186 interactions contributed by 103 host and 76 bacterial
proteins. Bacterial interacting partners were accounted as putative targets. And 
enrichment analysis of host interacting partners showed statistically enriched
terms that were in positive correlation with CRC, atherosclerosis,
cardiovascular, osteoporosis, Alzheimer's and other diseases.
CONCLUSION: Subtractive genomics analysis provided a set of target proteins
suggested to be indispensable for survival and pathogenicity of F. nucleatum.
These target proteins might be considered for designing potent inhibitors to
abrogate F. nucleatum infections. From enrichment analysis, it was hypothesized
that F. nucleatum infection might enhance CRC progression by simultaneously
regulating multiple signaling cascades which could lead to up-regulation of
proinflammatory responses, oncogenes, modulation of host immune defense mechanism
and suppression of DNA repair system.

Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are the main representatives of 
inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), a group of chronic, immune system-mediated
inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The pathogenesis of the
intestinal lesions in IBD is not entirely identified and understood: excessive
activation of the immune system may come as a result of the interaction of
various environmental and infectious factors, genetic predisposition, and the
mediation of abnormal intestinal flora. The main objective of the current study
is to further identify the risk factors for the development of IBD. Currently,
there is very little knowledge about circadian rhythm and IBD and there are only 
a few studies on the relationship between sleep disturbances and the course of
the disease, as well as pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine profile and general
immune system functioning. Furthermore, the relationship between the expression
of circadian rhythm genes and severe course of IBD is still unknown. The aim of
this review is to show the current state of knowledge about the relationship
between circadian rhythm disorders, sleep disturbance and inflammation in the GI 
tract and to analyze the possibility of employing this knowledge in diagnosis and
treatment of IBD.

Colorectal cancer, encompassing colon and rectal cancer, arises from the
epithelial lining of the large bowel. It is most prevalent in Westernised
societies and is increasing in frequency as the world becomes more
industrialised. Unfortunately, metastatic colorectal cancer is not cured by
chemotherapy and the annual number of deaths caused by colorectal cancer,
currently 700,000, is expected to rise. Our understanding of the contribution
that genetic mutations make to colorectal cancer, although incomplete, is
reasonably well advanced. However, it has only recently become widely appreciated
that in addition to the ongoing accumulation of genetic mutations, chronic
inflammation also plays a critical role in the initiation and progression of this
disease. While a robust and tractable genetic model of colorectal cancer in
zebrafish, suitable for pre-clinical studies, is not yet available, the
identification of genes required for the rapid proliferation of zebrafish
intestinal epithelial cells during development has highlighted a number of
essential genes that could be targeted to disable colorectal cancer cells.
Moreover, appreciation of the utility of zebrafish to study intestinal
inflammation is on the rise. In particular, zebrafish provide unique
opportunities to investigate the impact of genetic and environmental factors on
the integrity of intestinal epithelial barrier function. With currently available
tools, the interplay between epigenetic regulators, intestinal injury, microbiota
composition and innate immune cell mobilisation can be analysed in exquisite
detail. This provides excellent opportunities to define critical events that
could potentially be targeted therapeutically. Further into the future, the use
of zebrafish larvae as hosts for xenografts of human colorectal cancer tissue,
while still in its infancy, holds great promise that zebrafish could one day
provide a practical, preclinical personalized medicine platform for the rapid
assessment of the metastatic potential and drug-sensitivity of patient-derived
cancers.

Complex interactions between the host and the gut microbiota govern intestinal
homeostasis but remain poorly understood. Here we reveal a relationship between
gut microbiota and caspase recruitment domain family member 9 (CARD9), a
susceptibility gene for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that functions in the
immune response against microorganisms. CARD9 promotes recovery from colitis by
promoting interleukin (IL)-22 production, and Card9(-/-) mice are more
susceptible to colitis. The microbiota is altered in Card9(-/-) mice, and
transfer of the microbiota from Card9(-/-) to wild-type, germ-free recipients
increases their susceptibility to colitis. The microbiota from Card9(-/-) mice
fails to metabolize tryptophan into metabolites that act as aryl hydrocarbon
receptor (AHR) ligands. Intestinal inflammation is attenuated after inoculation
of mice with three Lactobacillus strains capable of metabolizing tryptophan or by
treatment with an AHR agonist. Reduced production of AHR ligands is also observed
in the microbiota from individuals with IBD, particularly in those with CARD9
risk alleles associated with IBD. Our findings reveal that host genes affect the 
composition and function of the gut microbiota, altering the production of
microbial metabolites and intestinal inflammation.

Epidemiological and clinical studies have suggested that the pathogenesis of
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is strongly influenced by genetic
predisposition. Beyond the limitations of linkage analysis, multiple genome-wide 
association studies, their meta-analyses, and targeted genotyping array
techniques have broadened our understanding of the genetic architecture of IBD.
Currently, over 200 single nucleotide polymorphisms are known to be associated
with susceptibility to IBD and through functional analysis of genes and loci, a
substantial proportion of pathophysiologic mechanisms have been revealed.
However, because only a modest fraction of predicted heritability can be
explained by known genes/loci, additional strategies are needed including the
identification of rare variants with large effect sizes to help explain the
missing heritability. Considerable progress is also being made on applying
outcomes of genetic research in diagnostics, classification, prognostics, and the
development of new therapeutics of IBD.

Alterations in the composition of commensal bacterial populations, a phenomenon
known as dysbiosis, are linked to multiple gastrointestinal disorders, such as
inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome, or to infections by
diverse enteric pathogens. Blastocystis is one of the most common single-celled
eukaryotes detected in human faecal samples. However, the clinical significance
of this widespread colonization remains unclear, and its pathogenic potential is 
controversial. To address the issue of Blastocystis pathogenicity, we
investigated the impact of colonization by this protist on the composition of the
human gut microbiota. For that purpose, we conducted a cross-sectional study
including 48 Blastocystis-colonized patients and 48 Blastocystis-free subjects
and performed an Ion Torrent 16S rDNA gene sequencing to decipher the
Blastocystis-associated gut microbiota. Here, we report a higher bacterial
diversity in faecal microbiota of Blastocystis colonized patients, a higher
abundance of Clostridia as well as a lower abundance of Enterobacteriaceae. Our
results contribute to suggesting that Blastocystis colonization is usually
associated with a healthy gut microbiota, rather than with gut dysbiosis
generally observed in metabolic or infectious inflammatory diseases of the lower 
gastrointestinal tract.

It has been established that mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors have
anti-inflammatory effects in models of experimental colitis. However, the
underlying mechanism is largely unknown. In this research, we investigate the
anti-inflammatory effects of AZD8055, a potent mTOR inhibitor, on T cell response
in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice, a commonly used animal
model of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Severity of colitis is evaluated by
changing of body weight, bloody stool, fecal consistency, histology evaluation
and cytokine expression. We find that AZD8055 treatment attenuates DSS-induced
body weight loss, colon length shortening and pathological damage of the colon.
And AZD8055 treatment decreases colonic expression of genes encoding the
pro-inflammatory cytokines interferon-γ, interleukin (IL)-17A, IL-1β,IL-6 and
tumor necrosis factor(TNF)-a and increases colonic expression of
anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10. We show that AZD8055 treatment decreases the
percentages of CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells in spleen, lymph nodes and
peripheral blood of mice. We also find that AZD8055 treatment significantly
reduces the number of T helper 1(TH1) cells and TH17 cells and increases
regulatory T (Treg) cells in the lamina propria and mesenteric lymph nodes.
Furthermore, we demonstrates that AZD8055 suppresses the proliferation of CD4+
and CD8+ T cells and the differentiation of TH1/TH17 cells and expands Treg cells
in vitro. The results suggest that, in experimental colitis, AZD8055 exerts
anti-inflammatory effect by regulating T helper cell polarization and
proliferation.

Genes encoding proteins critical for intracellular vesicular transport are an
emerging area of importance for neurologists. In particular, proteins that create
and maintain the correct compartmental pH, such as the endosomal Na(+)/H(+)
exchangers (NHEs), have been implicated in a wide range of human diseases,
including cardiovascular, inflammatory bowel, renal, and neurologic disorders,
which demonstrates the critical cellular function of these proteins.(1-3) Two
NHEs, NHE6 and NHE9, have been linked to neurologic disorders in children.(4)
Pathologic variants in SLC9A6 encoding NHE6 cause an Angelman-like disorder
called Christianson syndrome. Fewer variants have been described in SLC9A9
encoding NHE9, but individuals carrying these variants have been diagnosed with
neurologic disorders ranging from autism to epilepsy to
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The majority of described variants are 
missense, resulting in amino acid substitutions, making it difficult to determine
their functional consequence.(4).

BACKGROUND: Dairy products may be involved in the etiology of inflammatory bowel 
disease by modulating gut microbiota and immune responses, but data from
epidemiological studies examining this relationship are limited. We investigated 
the association between prediagnostic intake of these foods and dietary calcium, 
and the subsequent development of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis
(UC).
METHODS: In total, 401,326 participants were enrolled in the European Prospective
Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort. At recruitment, consumption of
total and specific dairy products (milk, yogurt, and cheese) and dietary calcium 
was measured using validated food frequency questionnaires. Cases developing
incident CD (n = 110) or UC (n = 244) during follow-up were matched with 4
controls. Conditional logistic regression analyses were used to calculate odds
ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for total energy
intake and smoking.
RESULTS: Compared with the lowest quartile, the ORs for the highest quartile of
total dairy products and dietary calcium intake were 0.61 (95% CI, 0.32-1.19, p
trend = 0.19) and 0.63 (95% CI, 0.28-1.42, p trend = 0.23) for CD, and 0.80 (95% 
CI, 0.50-1.30, p trend = 0.40) and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.49-1.34, p trend = 0.60) for
UC, respectively. Compared with nonconsumers, individuals consuming milk had
significantly reduced odds of CD (OR 0.30, 95% CI, 0.13-0.65) and
nonsignificantly reduced odds of UC (OR 0.85, 95% CI, 0.49-1.47).
CONCLUSIONS: Milk consumption may be associated with a decreased risk of
developing CD, although a clear dose-response relationship was not established.
Further studies are warranted to confirm this possible protective effect.

Tumor necrosis factor α inhibitors (anti-TNF) have improved treatment of several 
complex diseases, including Crohn's disease (CD). However, the effect varies and 
approximately one-third of the patients do not respond. Since blood parameters as
well as genetic factors have shown a great potential to predict response during
treatment, the aim of the study was to evaluate response to anti-TNF treatment
with adalimumab (ADA) between genes HFE and TF and haematological parameters in
Slovenian refractory CD patients. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
rs1799852 in gene TF and rs2071303 in gene HFE were genotyped in 68 refractory CD
patients for which response has been measured using inflammatory bowel disease
questionnaire (IBDQ) index. Haematological parameters and IBDQ index were
determined before therapy and after 4, 12, 20 and 30 weeks. We found novel strong
association between SNP rs2071303 in gene HFE and response to ADA treatment,
particularly patients with G allele comparing to A allele had better response
after 20 weeks (p = 0.008). Further, we found strong association between
transferrin level at baseline and treatment response after 12, 20 and 30 weeks,
where average transferrin level before therapy was lower in responders (2.38 g/L)
compared to non-responders (2.89 g/L, p = 0.005). Association was found between
transferrin level in week 30 and SNP rs1799852 (p = 0.023), and between MCHC
level before treatment and SNP rs2071303 (p = 0.007). Our results suggest that
SNP in gene HFE as well as haematological markers serve as promising prognostic
markers of response to anti-TNF treatment in CD patients.

BACKGROUND/AIM: The traditional Chinese medicine Baishaoqiwu (BSQW) has been
previously used to clinically treat inflammatory bowel diseases. However, the
mechanisms of it's therapeutic efficacy remain unclear. The aim of this study was
to examine the efficacy of BSQW on ulcerative colitis (UC) and the
TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway in a rat model of colitis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The colitis rat model was induced by anal instillation of 
2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). The animals with induced colitis were
treated with BSQW at a dose of 13.2 mg/kg daily, p.o. Mesalazin was used as a
positive control and was given to the animals with induced colitis at a dose of
420 mg/kg daily, p.o. The untreated animals with induced colitis and normal
animals served as model controls and normal controls, respectively. Macroscopic
and histological assessments were performed after treatment. The expression of
MyD88, NF-κB P65 and TLR4 were determined by immunohistochemical analysis.
RESULTS: Administration of BSQW or Mesalazin ameliorated TNBS-induced macroscopic
and histological damage in the rats with induced colitis. The macroscopic score
and total colitis index were significantly reduced in the BSQW- and
Mesalazin-treated groups compared to the model control group (p<0.05). BSQW or
Mesalazin significantly inhibited TNBS-induced expression of the TLR4, MyD88 and 
NF-κB P65 genes. No treatment-related toxicity was found in either the BSQW- or
the Mesalazin-treated groups.
CONCLUSION: Suppression of the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway may be one of
the mechanisms involved in the therapeutic efficacy of BSQW against UC.

BACKGROUND: The inflammatory bowel diseases known as Crohn's disease (CD) and
ulcerative colitis (UC) are related autoimmune conditions with a complex etiology
composed of genetic and environmental factors. Genetic studies have revealed 200 
susceptibility loci for inflammatory bowel diseases, but these only account for a
small fraction of the genetic heritability of the disease. We employed
pathway-based approaches to identify genes that cooperatively make contributions 
to the genetic etiology of CD.
METHODS: We exploited the largest CD dataset (20,000 cases + 28,000 controls) and
UC dataset (17,000 cases + 33,500 controls) to date. We conducted a meta-analysis
of 5 CD cohorts of European ancestry using 3 pathway-based approaches and further
performed replication studies in an independent cohort genotyped on the
Immunochip and in another pediatric cohort of European ancestry. Similar
meta-analysis was performed for UC cohorts.
RESULTS: In addition to the multiple immune-related pathways that have been
implicated in the genetic etiology of inflammatory bowel diseases before, we
found significant associations involving genes in growth factor signaling for CD.
This result was replicated in 2 independent cohorts of European ancestry. This
association with growth factor activity is not unique to CD. We found a similar
significant association with UC cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that genes involved in pathways of growth
factor signaling may make joint contributions to the etiology of CD and UC,
providing novel insight into the genetic mechanisms of these diseases.

Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have a high risk for development
of colitis-associated cancer (CAC). Serotonin is a neurotransmitter produced by
enterochromaffin cells of the intestine. Serotonin and its receptors, mainly
5-HT3 receptor, are overexpressed in IBD and promote development of CAC through
production of inflammatory cytokines. In the present study, we demonstrated the
in vivo activity of tropisetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, against
experimental CAC. CAC was induced by azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sodium sulfate
(DDS) in BALB/c mice. The histopathology of colon tissue was performed.
Beta-catenin and Cox-2 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry as well
as quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). Alterations in the
expression of 5-HT3 receptor and inflammatory-associated genes such as Il-1β,
Tnf-α, Tlr4 and Myd88 were determined by qRT-PCR. Our results showed that tumor
development in tropisetron-treated CAC group was significantly lower than the
controls. The qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that the expression of 5-HT3 receptor
was significantly increased following CAC induction. In addition, tropisetron
reduced expression of β-catenin and Cox-2 in the CAC experimental group. The
levels of Il-1β, Tnf-α, Tlr4 and Myd88 were significantly decreased upon
tropisetron treatment in the AOM/DSS group. Taken together, our data show that
tropisetron inhibits development of CAC probably by attenuation of inflammatory
reactions in the colitis.

The function of the Laccase domain-containing 1 (LACC1) gene is unknown, but
genetic variation at this locus has been reported to consistently affect the risk
of Crohn's disease (CD) and leprosy. Recently, a LACC1 missense mutation was
found in patients suffering from monogenic forms of CD, but also systemic
juvenile idiopathic arthritis. We tested the hypothesis that LACC1 single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), in addition to CD, are associated with juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis (JIA, non-systemic), and another major form of inflammatory 
bowel disease, ulcerative colitis (UC). We selected 11 LACC1 tagging SNPs, and
tested their effect on disease risk in 3855 Swedish individuals from three
case-control cohorts of CD, UC and JIA. We detected false discovery rate
corrected significant associations with individual markers in all three cohorts, 
thereby expanding previous results for CD also to UC and JIA. LACC1's link to
several inflammatory diseases suggests a key role in the human immune system and 
justifies further characterization of its function(s).

BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an idiopathic disease of the large
intestine with evidence pointing to the role of epigenetic changes.
METHODS: Searches were performed in three databases (EMBASE, MEDLINE and Web of
Science), following PRISMA protocol. DNA methylation was the only epigenetic
mechanism affecting genes linked to inflammatory response in UC.
RESULTS: A total of 25 differentially methylated inflammatory genes were
identified. Hypermethylation of miR-1247 significantly correlates (p = 0.0006)
with refractory UC while PAR2 hypermethylation correlates (p = 0.007) with
corticosteroid dependence.
CONCLUSION: Evidence points to a step-wise increase in methylation status of the 
genome between a healthy colon, quiescent UC and when inflamed. Inflammatory
genes (which are aberrantly methylated), have also been implicated in cancer
development in UC.

Crohn's disease is often treated with the anti-tumor necrosis factor-α drug
adalimumab. However, about 20%-40% of patients do not display adequate
therapeutic response. We prospectively evaluated, during a routine therapy of
Crohn's disease patients, the candidate autophagy-related genes ATG12 and ATG5
and the inflammation-related genes NFKB1, NFKBIA, and CRP as potential predictors
of adalimumab treatment response (pharmacodynamics). The associations of
haplotypes and SNPs in these genes with response to drug therapy, biochemical
parameters, and body mass were determined at baseline and after 4, 12, 20, and 30
weeks of therapy. Association analysis showed that haplotypes defined with the
SNPs rs9373839 and rs510432 in ATG5 gene were significantly associated with
positive response to therapy (p < 0.002). In addition, allele C and genotypes CC 
and CT of the rs1130864 in the CRP gene were positively associated with
therapeutic response (p < 0.002). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
report that supports the association of SNPs in ATG5 and CRP genes with response 
to adalimumab therapy in Crohn's disease. Further study of these biological
pathways in larger and independent clinical samples is warranted as novel streams
of research on precision medicine and diagnostics for Crohn's disease.

Colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC) seems to be a rather unique entity and
differs in its genetic alterations, tumour formation capacities, and clinical
features from sporadic colorectal carcinoma. Most descriptions about tumour
biology of CAC refer to ulcerative colitis; data about Crohn´s colitis related
carcinomas are scarce. The majority of patients with Crohn´s disease are under
immunosuppression which generates a different environment for tumour growth. We
first describe the clinical case of a fast growing CAC in a long-term
immunosuppressed patient with Crohn´s disease and successful establishment and
characterization of carcinoma cell lines along with their corresponding
patient-derived xenograft. Subsequently, these tumor models were molecularly and 
functionally analysed. Beside numerous chromosomal alterations, mutations in
TP53, APC, PTEN and SMAD3 were identified. The cell lines express numerous cancer
testis antigens, surface molecules involved in immune evasion but low levels of
HLA class I molecules. They show strong invasive but in comparison weak migratory
activity. The present work is the first description of patient-derived in vitro
and in vivo models for CAC from a Crohn´s disease patient. They might be valuable
tools for analysis of genetic and epigenetic alterations, biomarker
identification, functional testing, including response prediction, and the
development of specific therapeutical strategies.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of and mortality from colorectal cancers (CRC) can be
reduced by early detection. Currently there is a lack of established markers to
detect early neoplastic changes. We aimed to identify the copy number variations 
(CNVs) and the associated genes which could be potential markers for the
detection of neoplasia in both ulcerative colitis-associated neoplasia (UC-CRN)
and sporadic colorectal neoplasia (S-CRN).
METHODS: We employed array comparative genome hybridization (aCGH) to identify
CNVs in tissue samples of UC nonprogressor, progressor and sporadic CRC. Select
genes within these CNV regions as a panel of markers were validated using
quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) method along with the microsatellite
instability (MSI) in an independent cohort of samples. Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
analysis was also performed.
RESULTS: Integrated analysis showed 10 overlapping CNV regions between
UC-Progressor and S-CRN, with the 8q and 12p regions showing greater overlap. The
qRT-PCR based panel of MYC, MYCN, CCND1, CCND2, EGFR and FNDC3A was successful in
detecting neoplasia with an overall accuracy of 54% in S-CRN compared to that of 
29% in UC neoplastic samples. IHC study showed that p53 and CCND1 were
significantly overexpressed with an increasing frequency from pre-neoplastic to
neoplastic stages. EGFR and AMACR were expressed only in the neoplastic
conditions.
CONCLUSION: CNVs that are common and unique to both UC-associated and sporadic
colorectal neoplasm could be the key players driving carcinogenesis. Comparative 
analysis of CNVs provides testable driver aberrations but needs further
evaluation in larger cohorts of samples. These markers may help in developing
more effective neoplasia-detection strategies during screening and surveillance
programs.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of interleukin-1β
(IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) gene co-silencing in mouse gastric
cancer (GC) cells. Respectively, three pairs of liposome-encapsulated IL-1β and
TNFα small interfering RNA (siRNA) were transfected into the mouse GC cell line
MFC. The most effective siRNA, as identified by reverse transcription-polymerase 
chain reaction, was used for co-suppression of IL-1β and TNFα genes. The
activities of cell proliferation, colony formation and migration were determined 
by the Cell Counting Kit 8 method, colony formation assay and Transwell assay,
respectively. Protein array analysis was performed to identify the differentially
expressed factors. The possible signaling pathways of the various factors
targeting the genes were identified by pathway enrichment analysis using KOBAS
2.0. siRNA1 and siRNAc were the most effective interference sequences for IL-1β
and TNFα, respectively. Following co-transfection of siRNA1 and siRNAc, the
expression of IL-1β and TNFα was inhibited at the mRNA and protein levels, and
the cell proliferation, colony forming and migration abilities were reduced
(P<0.05). The expression of inflammatory factors, including chemokine ligand 5,
cyclooxygenase-2, IL-6, transforming growth factor β, IL-17A, matrix
metallopeptidase 9 and stromal cell-derived factor 1α were also inhibited
(P<0.05). These factors are mainly involved in the rheumatoid arthritis pathway, 
the intestinal immune network for IgA production, the TNF signaling pathway and
the inflammatory bowel disease pathway. IL-1β and TNFα gene silencing inhibits
the proliferation and migration of MFC. The mechanisms may involve multiple
inflammatory factors that participate in the signaling pathways of tumor tissue
inflammation, the immune network and TNF.

Crohn's disease (CD) is a prominent type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that
can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract. CD is known to have higher
prevalence in the Western countries, but the number of cases has been increasing 
in the past decades in Asia, including Malaysia. Therefore, there is a need to
investigate the underlining causes of CD that may shed light on its prevention
and treatment. In this study, genetic polymorphisms in NOD1 (rs2075820), CXCL16
(rs2277680), STAT6 (rs324015) and TLR4 (rs4986791) genes were examined in a total
of 335 individuals (85 CD patients and 250 healthy controls) with PCR-RFLP
approach. There was no significant association observed between NOD1 rs2075820
and STAT6 rs324015 with the onset of CD in the studied cohort. However, the G
allele of CXCL16 rs2277680 was found to have a weak association with CD patients 
(P = 0.0482; OR = 1.4310). The TLR4 rs4986791 was also significantly associated
to CD. Both the homozygous C genotype (P = 0.0029; OR = 0.3611) and C allele (P =
0.0069; OR = 0.4369) were observed to confer protection against CD. On the other 
hand, the heterozygous C/T genotype was a risk genotype (P = 0.0015; OR =
3.1392). Further ethnic-stratified analysis showed that the significant
associations in CXCL16 rs2277680 and TLR4 rs4986791 were accounted by the Malay
cohort. In conclusion, the present study reported two CD-predisposing loci in the
Malay CD patients. However, these loci were not associated to the onset of CD in 
Chinese and Indian patients.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's
disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are at increased risk for small bowel
or colorectal cancers (colitis-associated cancers [CACs]). We compared the
spectrum of genomic alterations in CACs with those of sporadic colorectal cancers
(CRCs) and investigated differences between CACs from patients with CD vs UC.
METHODS: We studied tumor tissues from patients with CACs treated at Memorial
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center or Weill Cornell Medical College from 2003 through 
2015. We performed hybrid capture-based next-generation sequencing analysis of
>300 cancer-related genes to comprehensively characterize genomic alterations.
RESULTS: We performed genomic analyses of 47 CACs (from 29 patients with UC and
18 with CD; 43 primary tumors and 4 metastases). Primary tumors developed in the 
ileum (n = 2), right colon (n = 18), left colon (n = 6), and rectosigmoid or
rectum (n = 21). We found genomic alterations in TP53, IDH1, and MYC to be
significantly more frequent, and mutations in APC to be significantly less
frequent, than those reported in sporadic CRCs by The Cancer Genome Atlas or
Foundation Medicine. We identified genomic alterations that might be targeted by 
a therapeutic agent in 17 of 47 (36%) CACs. These included the mutation encoding 
IDH1 R132; amplification of FGFR1, FGFR2, and ERBB2; and mutations encoding BRAF 
V600E and an EML4-ALK fusion protein. Alterations in IDH1 and APC were
significantly more common in CACs from patients with CD than UC.
CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of CACs from 47 patients, we found significant
differences in the spectrum of genomic alterations in CACs compared with sporadic
CRCs. We observed a high frequency of IDH1 R132 mutations in patients with CD but
not UC, as well as a high frequency of MYC amplification in CACs. Many genetic
alterations observed in CACs could serve as therapeutic targets.

The co-occurrence of the three disease entities, inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD), colorectal cancer (CRC), type 2diabetes mellitus (T2DM) along with
inflammation and dismicrobism has been frequently reported. Some authors have
even suggested that dysbiosis could be the link through a molecular crosstalk of 
multiple inflammatory loops including TGFβ, NFKB, TNFα and ROS among others. This
review focuses on the inflammatory process along with the role of microbiota in
the pathophysiology of the three diseases. The etiology of IBD is multifactorial,
and like CRC and T2DM, it is associated with a widespread and sustained GI
inflammation and dismicrobism, whereby an array of pro-inflammatory mediators and
other related biomolecules are up-regulated, both locally and systematically.
Such a persistent or an inadequately resolved chronic inflammation may be a
causative agent, in the presence other factors, leading to several pathologies
such as IBD, CRC and T2DM. TGFβ plays a crucial role in pancreatic β cell
malfunctioning as glucotoxicity stimulates its signaling cascade through smad 3, 
IL-6 and epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Such a cascade could lead to
macrophages and other cells recruitment, inflammation, then IBD and CRC. NFkB is 
also another key regulator in the crosstalk among the pathways leading to the
three disease entities. It plays a major role in linking inflammation to cancer
development through its ability to up regulate several inflammatory and tumor
promoting cytokines like: IL-6, IL-1 α and TNF α, as well as genes like BCL2 and 
BCLXL. It activates JAK/STAT signaling network via STAT3 transcription factors
and promotes epithelial to mesenchymal transition. It also increases the risk for
T2DM in obese people. In brief, NFKB is a matchmaker between inflammation, IBD,
cancer and diabetes. In addition, TNFα plays a pivotal role in systemic
inflammation. It is increased in the mucosa of IBD patients and has a central
role in its pathogenesis. It also activates other signaling pathways like NFKB
and MAPK leading to CRC. It is also overexpressed in the adipose tissues of obese
patients thus linking it to T2DM, chronic inflammation and consequently CRC. On
the other hand, increasing evidence suggests that dysbiosis plays a role in
initiating, maintaining and determining the severity of IBD. Actually, among its 
functions, it modulates genotoxic metabolites which are able to induce CRC, a
fact proven to be sustained by stool transfer from patients with CRC. Probiotics,
however, may actively prevent CRC as well as IBD and results in a significant
decrease in fasting glycemia in T2DM patients. In conclusion, IBD, CRC and T2DM
are commonly occurring interrelated clinical problems. They share a common basis 
influenced by an inflammatory process, an imbalance in intestinal microbiota, and
a crosstalk between various signaling pathways. Would probiotics interrupt the
crosstalk or orient it in the physiological direction?

An understanding of mucosal immunity is essential for the comprehension of
intestinal diseases that are often caused by a complex interplay between host
factors, environmental influences and the intestinal microbiota. Not only
improvements in endoscopic techniques, but also advances in high throughput
sequencing technologies, have expanded knowledge of how intestinal diseases
develop. This review discusses how the host interacts with intestinal microbiota 
by the direct contact of host receptors with highly conserved structural motifs
or molecules of microbes and also by microbe-derived metabolites (produced by the
microbe during adaptation to the gut environment), such as short-chain fatty
acids, vitamins, bile acids and amino acids. These metabolites are recognised by 
metabolite-sensing receptors expressed by immune cells to influence functions of 
macrophages, dendritic cells and T cells, such as migration, conversion and
maintenance of regulatory T cells and regulation of proinflammatory cytokine
production, which is essential for the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis and 
the development of intestinal diseases, such as inflammatory bowel diseases.
First interventions in these complex interactions between microbe-derived
metabolites and the host immune system for the treatment of gastrointestinal
diseases, such as modification of the diet, treatment with antibiotics,
application of probiotics and faecal microbiota transplantation, have been
introduced into the clinic. Specific targeting of metabolite sensing receptors
for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases is in development. In future,
precision medicine approaches that consider individual variability in genes, the 
microbiota, the environment and lifestyle will become increasingly important for 
the care of patients with gastrointestinal diseases.

PURPOSE: It is now recognized that Crohn's disease (CD), similar to ulcerative
colitis (UC), carries an up to 20-fold higher cancer risk, and the development of
colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is a major long-term complication. Once CRC is
present, molecular profiling is one of the components in selecting appropriate
treatment strategies; however, in contrast to UC, genetic alterations in Crohn's 
colitis-associated CRC are poorly understood.
METHODS: In a series of 227 patients with Crohn's colitis, we identified 33 cases
of CRC (~14 %) and performed targeted mutational analysis of BRAF/KRAS/NRAS and
determined microsatellite status as well as immunophenotype of the tumors.
RESULTS: In the CRC cohort, the median age at time of cancer diagnosis was 58
(range 34-77 vs. 59.5 in sporadic; P = 0.81) and the median CD duration was
29 years (range 6-45). As a group, CRC complicating Crohn's colitis is BRAF
(97 %) and NRAS (100 %) wild type and the vast majority is microsatellite stable 
(94 %); KRAS-mutations were found in six cases (18 %). Stage grouping, anatomic
distribution, and overall survival were similar to sporadic CRC; however,
long-standing CD (≥25 years) as well as gastric-immunophenotype (MUC5AC+) was
associated with significantly shorter overall survival (P = 0.0029; P = 0.036,
respectively).
CONCLUSION: In summary, the clinicopathological and molecular profile of
CD-associated CRC is similar to that observed in sporadic CRC.

OBJECTIVE: Multiple environmental and genetic factors contribute to the risks of 
ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Several allelic variants have
been identified in natural resistance associated macrophage protein 1 (NRAMP1)
gene; however, their association with UC/CD remains conflicting. The purpose of
this study was to evaluate whether NRAMP1 polymorphisms are associated with the
susceptibility to UC/CD.
METHODS: A meta-analysis on the association between the NRAMP1 polymorphisms and 
susceptibility to UC/CD was performed. Relevant studies were retrieved from the
databases. After eligible data were extracted, Mantel-Haenszel statistics and
random/fixed effects model were applied to calculate the pooled odds radio (OR)
and 95% confidence interval (95% CI).
RESULTS: Seven articles containing 536 UC cases, 997 CD cases, and 1361 controls 
were collected. No significant association between allele 2 frequency of NRAMP1
and susceptibility to UC/CD was detected in overall population (all p > 0.05).
However, increased UC/CD risk for allele 3 was observed in Caucasian population
(OR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.08~1.50, p = 0.04), whereas decreased UC/CD risk was
detected in non-Caucasian population (OR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.60~0.87, p < 0.001), 
under "allele 3 vs. other alleles" model. Moreover, a significant increase in CD 
risk for T carrier frequency of -237 C/T (OR = 0.44, 95% CI, 0.26~0.75, p =
0.003) was detected, but not 274 C/T and 1729+55del4 (TGTG) +/del.
CONCLUSIONS: The polymorphism of -237 C/T is related to the risk of CD; and the
association of allele 3 with UC/CD risk differs in Caucasian and non-Caucasian
population, which might be the potential biomarkers for clinical diagnosis of
UC/CD.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Angiotensin II (AII) is a powerful splanchnic
vasoconstrictor with pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic properties. Angiotensin
converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and AII Receptor Antagonists (ARBs) are
therapeutic in animal models of colitis. The aim of this case-control study is to
determine the expression of angiotensinogen and related genes in human ileal
Crohn's disease.
METHODS: Using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we
measured mRNA expression levels of angiotensinogen (AGT), hypoxia inducible
factor (HIF)1α and melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM; CD146) in 101 human
samples (69 biopsy, 12 resection) from affected ileum (inflamed CD cases, n=36)
and unaffected ileum (non-inflamed CD cases, n=45 and controls, n=20).
Immunohistochemistry for angiotensinogen was also performed. The study was of
case-control design in a tertiary care setting.
RESULTS: Ileal expression of AGT was lower in CD cases compared to controls
(p<0.0001), in inflamed CD samples (p=0.017) and current smokers (p=0.02). HIF1α 
expression was lower in non-inflamed CD biopsy samples than controls (p=0.006).
The presence of disease-associated NOD2 variants was associated with increased
expression of markers of angiogenesis (HIF1α p=0.009; MCAM p=0.007) in inflamed
CD samples. Angiotensinogen immunohistochemical staining supported the
quantitative RT-PCR expression findings.
CONCLUSIONS: Angiotensinogen expression is down regulated in human ileal CD,
particularly in the presence of inflammation and current cigarette smoking,
implicating the mesenteric vasculature and mucosal hypoxia as co-factors in ileal
CD pathogenesis. A novel reduction in HIF1α expression in non-inflamed ileal
mucosa in CD patients was also demonstrated.

Lactobacilli are widely used as probiotics with beneficial effects on
infection-associated diarrhea, but also used in clinical trials of e.g.,
necrotizing enterocolitis and inflammatory bowel diseases. The possibility of
using probiotic metabolic products, so-called postbiotics, is desirable as it
could prevent possible side effects of live bacteria in individuals with a
disturbed gut epithelial barrier. Here, we studied how Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 
17938 cell-free supernatant (L. reuteri-CFS) influenced retinoic acid (RA)-driven
mucosal-like dendritic cells (DC) and their subsequent effect on T regulatory
cells (Treg) in vitro. RA clearly imprinted a mucosal-like DC phenotype with
higher IL10 production, increased CD103 and CD1d expression, and a downregulated 
mRNA expression of several inflammatory-associated genes (NFκB1, RELB, and TNF). 
Treatment with L. reuteri-CFS further influenced the tolerogenic phenotype of
RA-DC by downregulating most genes involved in antigen uptake, antigen
presentation, and signal transduction as well as several chemokine receptors,
while upregulating IL10 production. L. reuteri-CFS also augmented CCR7 expression
on RA-DC. In cocultures, RA-DC increased IL10 and FOXP3 expression in Treg, but
pre-treatment with L. reuteri-CFS did not further influence the Treg phenotype.
In conclusion, L. reuteri-CFS modulates the phenotype and function of
mucosal-like DC, implicating its potential application as postbiotic.

Expression of the pregnane X receptor (PXR) has been reported to be decreased in 
animal models of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). To investigate the
differential expression of PXR in children with Crohn's disease, a type of IBD,
RNA was extracted from archived intestinal biopsies from 18 children with Crohn's
disease (CD) and 12 age- and sex-matched controls (aged 7-17yrs). The aim of this
investigation was to compare the relative mRNA expression of PXR, cytochrome p450
3A4 (CYP3A4), and villin 1 (VIL1) (a marker of epithelial cell integrity) in the 
inflamed terminal ileum (TI) versus noninflamed duodenum of children with CD.
Relative expression was determined via reverse transcription real-time
quantitative polymerase chain reaction, data normalized to glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and differences in gene expression explored via paired
t tests. PXR expression was decreased in the inflamed TI versus noninflamed
duodenum (TI = 1.88 ± 0.89 versus duodenum = 2.5 ± 0.67; P < 0.001) in CD, but
not controls (TI = 2.11 ± 0.41 versus duodenum = 2.26 ± 0.61; P = 0.52). CYP3A4
expression was decreased in CD (TI = -0.89 ± 3.11 versus duodenum = 1.90 ± 2.29; 
P < 0.05), but not controls (TI = 2.46 ± 0.51 versus duodenum = 2.60 ± 0.60; P = 
0.61), as was VIL1 (CD TI = 3.80 ± 0.94 versus duodenum = 4.61 ± 0.52; P < 0.001;
controls TI = 4.30 ± 0.35 versus duodenum = 4.47 ± 0.40; P = 0.29). PXR
expression correlated with VIL1 (r = 0.78, P = 0.01) and CYP3A4 (r = 0.52, P =
0.01) expression. In conclusion, PXR, CYP3A4, and VIL1 expression was decreased
only in the actively inflamed small intestinal tissue in children with CD. Our
findings suggest that inflammation has the potential to influence expression of
genes, and potentially intestinal proteins, important to drug disposition and
response. The observed differential patterns of gene expression support further
investigation of the role of PXR in the pathogenesis and/or treatment of
pediatric Crohn's disease.

The gut microbiome is significantly altered in inflammatory bowel diseases, but
the basis of these changes is not well understood. We have combined metagenomic
and metatranscriptomic profiling of the gut microbiome to assess modifications to
both bacterial community structure and transcriptional activity in a mouse model 
of colitis. By using transcriptomic analysis of colonic tissue and luminal RNA
derived from the host, we have also characterised how host transcription relates 
to the microbial transcriptional response in inflammation. In colitis, increased 
abundance and transcription of diverse microbial gene families involved in
responses to nutrient deprivation, antimicrobial peptide production and oxidative
stress support an adaptation of multiple commensal genera to withstand a diverse 
set of environmental stressors in the inflammatory environment. These data are
supported by a transcriptional signature of activated macrophages and
granulocytes in the gut lumen during colitis, a signature that includes the
transcription of the key antimicrobial genes S100a8 and S100a9 (calprotectin).
Genes involved in microbial resistance to oxidative stress, including
Dps/ferritin, Fe-dependent peroxidase and glutathione S-transferase were
identified as changing to a greater extent at the level of transcription than
would be predicted by DNA abundance changes, implicating a role for increased
oxygen tension and/or host-derived reactive oxygen species in driving
transcriptional changes in commensal microbes.

The intestinal mucosa of Crohn disease (CD) patients is abnormally colonized by
adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC). Upon AIEC infection, autophagy is induced in
host cells to restrain bacterial intracellular replication. The underlying
mechanism, however, remains unknown. Here, we investigated the role of the
EIF2AK4-EIF2A/eIF2α-ATF4 pathway in the autophagic response to AIEC infection. We
showed that infection of human intestinal epithelial T84 cells with the AIEC
reference strain LF82 activated the EIF2AK4-EIF2A-ATF4 pathway, as evidenced by
increased phospho-EIF2AK4, phospho-EIF2A and ATF4 levels. EIF2AK4 depletion
inhibited autophagy activation in response to LF82 infection, leading to
increased LF82 intracellular replication and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine
production. Mechanistically, EIF2AK4 depletion suppressed the LF82-induced ATF4
binding to promoters of several autophagy genes including MAP1LC3B, BECN1,
SQSTM1, ATG3 and ATG7, and this subsequently inhibited transcription of these
genes. LF82 infection of wild-type (WT), but not eif2ak4(-/-), mice activated the
EIF2AK4-EIF2A-ATF4 pathway, inducing autophagy gene transcription and autophagy
response in enterocytes. Consequently, eif2ak4(-/-) mice exhibited increased
intestinal colonization by LF82 bacteria and aggravated inflammation compared to 
WT mice. Activation of the EIF2AK4-EIF2A-ATF4 pathway was observed in ileal
biopsies from patients with noninflamed CD, and this was suppressed in inflamed
CD, suggesting that a defect in the activation of this pathway could be one of
the mechanisms contributing to active disease. In conclusion, we show that
activation of the EIF2AK4-EIF2A-ATF4 pathway upon AIEC infection serves as a host
defense mechanism to induce functional autophagy to control AIEC intracellular
replication.

INTRODUCTION: Autophagy is a cellular stress response that plays key roles in
physiological processes, such as adaptation to starvation, degradation of
aberrant proteins or organelles, anti-microbial defense, protein secretion, and
innate and adaptive immunity. Dysfunctional autophagy is recognized as a
contributing factor in many chronic inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD). Genetic studies have identified multiple IBD-associated risk
loci that include genes required for autophagy, and several lines of evidence
demonstrate that autophagy is impaired in IBD patients. How dysfunctional
autophagy contributes to IBD onset is currently under investigation by
researchers.
KEY MESSAGES: Dysfunctional autophagy has been identified to play a role in IBD
pathogenesis by altering processes that include (1) intracellular bacterial
killing, (2) anti-microbial peptide secretion by Paneth cells, (3)
pro-inflammatory cytokine production by macrophages, (4) antigen presentation by 
dendritic cells, (5) goblet cell function, and (6) the endoplasmic reticulum
stress response in enterocytes. The overall effect of dysregulation of these
processes varies by cell type, stimulus, as well as cellular context.
Manipulation of the autophagic pathway may provide a new avenue in the search for
effective therapies for IBD.
CONCLUSION: Autophagy plays multiple roles in IBD pathogenesis. A better
understanding of the role of autophagy in IBD patients may provide better
subclassification of IBD phenotypes and novel approaches to disease management.

Environment and Genes: What Is the Interaction?

Blumberg RS(1).

Mass., USA.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) results from a continuum of complex interactions
between a quartet of host-derived and external elements that involve various
aspects of the intestinal microbiota, the immune system that is centered around
the intestinal epithelial cell barrier, the genetic composition of the host and
specific environmental factors. Recent studies into the complexity of these
arrangements increasingly support the syndromic nature of this disorder and
involve a wide range of interacting biologic pathways that affect innate
immunity, adaptive immunity, endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagy as well
as metabolic pathways associated with cellular homeostasis. It is further likely 
that all of the aforementioned host factors including the microbiota, which is as
much a part of ourselves as is any organ system, are under the influence of
yet-to-be-understood environmental factors that predispose to and precipitate
IBD. Notwithstanding the importance of genetic predisposition, these
environmental influences are no doubt central to disease pathogenesis in light of
the rapid emergence of IBD throughout the world and assumption of disease in
migrating populations from low to high risk environments. It can thus be
anticipated that environmental factors that modify the risk for development of
IBD have the common attribute of affecting the relationship between the commensal
microbiota and the immune system in a manner that intersects with the
functionally relevant immuno-genetic pathways, and potentially modifies them
through epigenetic effects, in a manner that are uniquely operative within a
particular syndromic context of IBD and occur sequentially and in a reiterative
fashion, perhaps beginning in early life.

IBD and Environment: Are There Differences between East and West.

BACKGROUND: The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), Crohn's disease (CD) and
ulcerative colitis (UC) occur worldwide with differences in epidemiology,
etiology and phenotype between regions. Breakthroughs have occurred in IBD
genetics, although the genes that predispose to IBD differ between racial groups.
What do we know about the 'envirotype' of those who develop IBD, and are there
differences between the East and the West?
KEY MESSAGES: The strongest IBD risk factor identified to date is a family
history of IBD. Whilst likely representing an underlying genetic predisposition, 
it may also reflect shared environmental factors amongst family members.
Cigarette smoking increases the risk of developing CD, whilst smoking is less
common in those who develop UC. Having ceased smoking increases the risk of
developing UC subsequently. Unlike the West, cigarette smoking appears to play a 
lesser role in the East. Other environmental risk factors are inconsistent.
Studies of migrant populations moving from regions of low to high IBD incidence
point to early life as a key time for environmental triggers. In these
populations, it is the second generation (those born in the high incidence
region) with higher IBD incidence rates than their parents. Early life
environmental exposures have been studied exhaustively but, except for having
been breastfed, few putative early childhood environmental risk factors have been
shown consistently to alter the risk of developing IBD.
CONCLUSIONS: The identification of IBD environmental risk factors remains elusive
in both the East and West. In the West, case-control studies are unlikely to move
the field forward without multi-level (phenotype, genotype, diet history,
'envirotype' and microbiome) data, ideally collected prospectively. Cohort
studies (such as the Genes, Environment, Microbiome project) may address some of 
these issues. However, in the East where IBD incidence is still increasing,
well-designed comprehensive case-control studies may identify differences that
give an insight into the 'envirotype' driving IBD incidence.

Risk Genes of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Asia: What Are the Most Important
Pathways Affected?

University, Xi'an, China.

Genetic factors play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel 
disease (IBD), and IBD is now recognized as a complex disease that results from
interplay between genetic and environment factors. To date, over 160
IBD-susceptible loci have been identified using genome-wide association studies
(GWAS). The risk genes identified in these studies are involved in various
pathways in innate and adaptive immune response such as innate bacterial sensing,
autophagy and interleukin-23 receptor/T-helper cell 17 pathway. It was initially 
believed that the genetic backgrounds of Asian IBD patients differ from that of
other populations. Recent GWAS and meta-analysis found that there is pervasive
sharing of risk loci between the East and West. Overlapping risk genes between
populations of different ancestries indicate that pathways underlying the
etiology of IBD may be common between Asia and other areas. However, the
importance of individual pathways may be different in Asia from the Western
countries. Identifying the most important pathways affected in Asian IBD patients
may provide a better understanding of pathogenesis of IBD in Asia and improve the
clinical management of the patients.

BACKGROUND: Fibrosis of the intestine is a common and poorly understood
complication of Crohn's disease (CD) characterized by excessive deposition of
extracellular matrix and accompanied by narrowing and obstruction of the gut
lumen. Defining the molecular characteristics of this fibrotic disorder is a
vital step in the development of specific prediction, prevention, and treatment
strategies. Previous epigenetic studies indicate that alterations in DNA
methylation could explain the mechanism by which mesenchymal cells adopt the
requisite pro-fibrotic phenotype that promotes fibrosis progression. However, to 
date, genome-wide analysis of the DNA methylome of any type of human fibrosis is 
lacking. We employed an unbiased approach using deep sequencing to define the DNA
methylome and transcriptome of purified fibrotic human intestinal fibroblasts
(HIF) from the colons of patients with fibrostenotic CD.
RESULTS: When compared with normal fibroblasts, we found that the majority of
differential DNA methylation was within introns and intergenic regions and not
associated with CpG islands. Only a low percentage occurred in the promoters and 
exons of genes. Integration of the DNA methylome and transcriptome identified
regions in three genes that inversely correlated with gene expression:
wingless-type mouse mammary tumor virus integration site family, member 2B
(WNT2B) and two eicosanoid synthesis pathway enzymes (prostacyclin synthase and
prostaglandin D2 synthase). These findings were independently validated by RT-PCR
and bisulfite sequencing. Network analysis of the data also identified candidate 
molecular interactions relevant to fibrosis pathology.
CONCLUSIONS: Our definition of a genome-wide fibrosis-specific DNA methylome
provides new gene networks and epigenetic states by which to understand
mechanisms of pathological gene expression that lead to fibrosis. Our data also
provide a basis for development of new fibrosis-specific therapies, as genes
dysregulated in fibrotic Crohn's disease, following functional validation, can
serve as new therapeutic targets.

Increasing epidemiological studies in patients with psoriasis report the frequent
occurrence of one or more associated disorders. Psoriasis is associated with
multiple comorbidities including autoimmune disease, neurological disorders,
cardiometabolic diseases and inflammatory-bowel disease. An integrated system
biology approach is utilized to decipher the molecular alliance of psoriasis with
its comorbidities. An unbiased integrative network medicine methodology is
adopted for the investigation of diseasome, biological process and pathways of
five most common psoriasis associated comorbidities. A significant overlap was
observed between genes acting in similar direction in psoriasis and its
comorbidities proving the mandatory occurrence of either one of its
comorbidities. The biological processes involved in inflammatory response and
cell signaling formed a common basis between psoriasis and its associated
comorbidities. The pathway analysis revealed the presence of few common pathways 
such as angiogenesis and few uncommon pathways which includes CCKR signaling map 
and gonadotrophin-realising hormone receptor pathway overlapping in all the
comorbidities. The work shed light on few common genes and pathways that were
previously overlooked. These fruitful targets may serve as a starting point for
diagnosis and/or treatment of psoriasis comorbidities. The current research
provides an evidence for the existence of shared component hypothesis between
psoriasis and its comorbidities.

Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease and a genetic
variant in the OCTN2, g.-207G > C is significantly associated with CD
susceptibility. This study was aimed to identify novel OCTN2 functional promoter 
variants and their roles in transcriptional regulation using various in vitro
assays. In addition, we investigated the association between OCTN2 genotypes and 
CD through genetic analysis using DNA samples from 193 patients with CD and 281
healthy controls. Among the three major promoter haplotypes of OCTN2 identified, 
one haplotype, H3, showed a significant decrease in promoter activity: two
polymorphisms in H3 were associated with a significant reduction in promoter
activity. In particular, we found that the reduced transcriptional activity of
those two polymorphisms results from a reduction in the binding affinity of the
activators, NF-E2 and YY1, to the OCTN2 promoter. The functional haplotype of the
OCTN2 promoter was associated with clinical course of CD such as the disease
behavior and need for surgery. However, genetic variants or haplotypes of OCTN2
did not affect the susceptibility to CD. Our results suggest that a common
promoter haplotype of OCTN2 regulates the transcriptional rate of OCTN2 and
influences the clinical course of CD.

BACKGROUND: Enteric glial cells (EGCs) are the main constituent of the enteric
nervous system and share similarities with astrocytes from the central nervous
system including their reactivity to an inflammatory microenvironment. Previous
studies on EGC pathophysiology have specifically focused on mucosal glia
activation and its contribution to mucosal inflammatory processes observed in the
gut of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. In contrast knowledge is scarce
on intestinal inflammation not locally restricted to the mucosa but systemically 
affecting the intestine and its effect on the overall EGC network.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, we analyzed the biological effects of a
systemic LPS-induced hyperinflammatory insult on overall EGCs in a rat model in
vivo, mimicking the clinical situation of systemic inflammation response syndrome
(SIRS). Tissues from small and large intestine were removed 4 hours after
systemic LPS-injection and analyzed on transcript and protein level. Laser
capture microdissection was performed to study plexus-specific gene expression
alterations. Upon systemic LPS-injection in vivo we observed a rapid and dramatic
activation of Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP)-expressing glia on mRNA
level, locally restricted to the myenteric plexus. To study the specific role of 
the GFAP subpopulation, we established flow cytometry-purified primary glial cell
cultures from GFAP promotor-driven EGFP reporter mice. After LPS stimulation, we 
analyzed cytokine secretion and global gene expression profiles, which were
finally implemented in a bioinformatic comparative transcriptome analysis.
Enriched GFAP+ glial cells cultured as gliospheres secreted increased levels of
prominent inflammatory cytokines upon LPS stimulation. Additionally, a shift in
myenteric glial gene expression profile was induced that predominantly affected
genes associated with immune response.
CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings identify the myenteric GFAP-expressing 
glial subpopulation as particularly susceptible and responsive to acute systemic 
inflammation of the gut wall and complement knowledge on glial involvement in
mucosal inflammation of the intestine.

The effect of psychological stress on the gastrointestinal microbiota is widely
recognized. Chronic psychological stress may be associated with increased disease
activity in inflammatory bowel disease, but the relationships among psychological
stress, the gastrointestinal microbiota, and the severity of colitis is not yet
fully understood. Here, we examined the impact of 12-week repeated
water-avoidance stress on the microbiota of two inbred strains of T cell receptor
alpha chain gene knockout mouse (background, BALB/c and C57BL/6) by means of
next-generation sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes. In both mouse strains,
knockout of the T cell receptor alpha chain gene caused a loss of
gastrointestinal microbial diversity and stability. Chronic exposure to repeated 
water-avoidance stress markedly altered the composition of the colonic microbiota
of C57BL/6 mice, but not of BALB/c mice. In C57BL/6 mice, the relative abundance 
of genus Clostridium, some members of which produce the toxin phospholipase C,
was increased, which was weakly positively associated with colitis severity,
suggesting that expansion of specific populations of indigenous pathogens may be 
involved in the exacerbation of colitis. However, we also found that colitis was 
not exacerbated in mice with a relatively diverse microbiota even if their
colonic microbiota contained an expanded phospholipase C-producing Clostridium
population. Exposure to chronic stress also altered the concentration of free
immunoglobulin A in colonic contents, which may be related to both the loss of
bacterial diversity in the colonic microbiota and the severity of the colitis
exacerbation. Together, these results suggest that long-term exposure to
psychological stress induces dysbiosis in the immunodeficient mouse in a
strain-specific manner and also that alteration of microbial diversity, which may
be related to an altered pattern of immunoglobulin secretion in the
gastrointestinal tract, might play a crucial role in the development of chronic
stress-induced colitis.

Syndromic diarrhea/tricho-hepato-enteric syndrome (SD/THE) is a rare, autosomal
recessive and severe bowel disorder mainly caused by mutations in the
tetratricopeptide repeat domain 37 (TTC37) gene which act as heterotetrameric
cofactors to enhance aberrant mRNAs decay. The phenotype and immune profiles of
SD/THE overlap those of primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs). Neonates with
intractable diarrhea underwent immunologic assessments including immunoglobulin
levels, lymphocyte subsets, lymphocyte proliferation, superoxide production, and 
IL-10 signaling function. Candidate genes for PIDs predisposing to inflammatory
bowel disease were sequencing in this study. Two neonates, born to
nonconsanguineous parents, suffered from intractable diarrhea, recurrent
infections, and massive hematemesis from esopharyngeal varices due to liver
cirrhosis or accompanying Trichorrhexis nodosa that developed with age and thus
guided the diagnosis of SD/THE compatible to TTC37 mutations (homozygous
DelK1155H, Fs*2; heterozygous Y1169Ter and InsA1143, Fs*3). Their immunologic
evaluation showed normal mitogen-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation, superoxide 
production, and IL-10 signaling, but low IgG levels, undetectable antibody to
hepatitis B surface antigen and decreased antigen-stimulated lymphocyte
proliferation. A PubMed search for bi-allelic TTC37 mutations and phenotypes were
recorded in 14 Asian and 12 non-Asian cases. They had similar presentations of
infantile onset refractory diarrhea, facial dysmorphism, hair anomalies, low IgG,
low birth weight, and consanguinity. A higher incidence of heart anomalies (8/14 
vs 2/12; P = 0.0344, Chi-square), nonsense mutations (19 in 28 alleles), and
hot-spot mutations (W936Ter, 2779-2G>A, and Y1169Ter) were found in the Asian
compared with the non-Asian patients. Despite immunoglobulin therapy in 20 of the
patients, 4 died from liver cirrhosis and 1 died from sepsis. Patients of all
ethnicities with SD/THE with the characteristic triad of T nodosa, hepatic
cirrhosis, and intractable enteropathy have low IgG, poor vaccine response and/or
decreased antigen-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation. This is now better
classified into the subgroup of "well-defined syndromes with immunodeficiency"
(the update termed as "combined immunodeficiencies with associated or syndromic
features") than "predominantly antibody deficiencies" in the update PIDs
classification, and requires optimal interventions.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is one of the two major forms of inflammatory bowel
disease, the aetiology of which remains unknown. Several studies have
demonstrated the genetic basis of disease, identifying more than 130
susceptibility loci. The major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related
gene A (MICA) is a useful candidate to be involved in UC pathogenesis, because it
could be important in recognizing the integrity of the epithelial cell and its
response to stress. The aim of this study was to analyse the relationship between
polymorphisms in the transmembrane domain of MICA and susceptibility to develop
UC. A total of 340 patients with UC and 636 healthy controls were genotyped for
MICA transmembrane polymorphism using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) combined 
with fluorescent technology. Different MICA alleles were determined depending on 
the PCR product size. The allele MICA*A4 was less frequent in patients than in
controls (P = 0·003; OR = 0·643), and this protective role is higher when it
forms haplotype with B*27 (P = 0·002; OR = 0·294). The haplotype HLA-B*52/MICA*A6
was also associated with UC [P = 0·001; odds ratio (OR) = 2·914]. No other
alleles, genotypes or haplotypes were related with UC risk. Moreover, MICA*A5.1
is associated independently with abscesses (P = 0·002; OR = 3·096) and its
frequency is lower in patients diagnosed between ages 17 and 40 years (P = 0·007;
OR = 0·633), meaning an extreme age on onset. No association with location,
extra-intestinal manifestations or need for surgery was found.

BACKGROUND: Perianal Crohn's Disease (pCD) is a particularly severe phenotype
associated with poor quality of life with a reported prevalence of 12%-40%.
Previous studies investigating the etiology of pCD have been limited in the
numbers of subjects and the intensity of genotyping. The aim of this study was to
identify clinical, serological, and genetic factors associated with pCD.
METHODS: We performed a case-control study comparing patients with (pCD+) and
without perianal (pCD) involvement in CD; defined as the presence of perianal
abscesses or fistulae. Data on demographics and clinical features were obtained
by chart review. Inflammatory bowel disease-related serology was determined by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Genetic data were generated using Illumina
genotyping platforms.
RESULTS: We included 1721 patients with CD of which 524 (30.4%) were pCD+ and
1197 were pPCD. pCD was associated with distal colonic disease (Odds ratio 5.54
[3.23-9.52], P < 0.001), stricturing disease behavior (1.44 [1.14-1.81], P =
0.002) and family history of inflammatory bowel disease (4.98 [3.30-7.46], P <
0.001). pCD was associated with higher anti-sacharomyces cerevisae antibodies IgA
(P < 0.001) and OmpC (P = 0.008) antibody levels. pCD was associated with known
inflammatory bowel disease loci, including KIF3B, CRTC3, TRAF3IP2, JAZF1, NRIP1, 
MST1, FUT2, and PTGER (all P < 0.05). We also identified genetic association with
genes involved in autophagy (DAPK1, P = 5.11 × 10), TNF alpha pathways (NUCB2, P 
= 8.68 × 10; DAPK1), IFNg pathways (DAPK1; NDFIP2, P = 8.74 × 10), and
extracellular matrix and scaffolding proteins (USH1C, P = 8.68 × 10; NDFIP2;
TMC07, P = 8.87 × 10). Pathway analyses implicated the JAK-Stat pathway (pc =
3.72 × 10).
CONCLUSION: We have identified associations between pCD, more distal colonic
inflammation, Crohn's disease-associated serologies, and genetic variation in the
JAK-Stat pathway.

The ingest of diets with high content of fats and carbohydrates, low or no
physical exercise and a stressful routine are part of the everyday lifestyle of
most people in the western world. These conditions are triggers for different
diseases with complex interactions between the host genetics, the metabolism, the
immune system and the microbiota, including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD),
obesity and diabetes. The incidence of these disorders is growing worldwide;
therefore, new strategies for its study are needed. Nowadays, the majority of
researches are in use of murine models for understand the genetics,
physiopathology and interaction between cells and signaling pathways to find
therapeutic solutions to these diseases. The zebrafish, a little tropical water
fish, shares 70% of our genes and conserves anatomic and physiological
characteristics, as well as metabolical pathways, with mammals, and is rising as 
a new complementary model for the study of metabolic and inflammatory diseases.
Its high fecundity, fast development, transparency, versatility and low cost of
maintenance makes the zebrafish an interesting option for new researches. In this
review, we offer a discussion of the existing genetic and induced zebrafish
models of two important Western diseases that have a strong inflammatory
component, the IBD and the obesity.

BACKGROUND: Our aims were (1) to correlate changes in the microbiota to
intestinal gene expression before and during the development of colitis in Muc2
mice and (2) to investigate whether the heterozygote Muc2 mouse would reveal host
markers of gut barrier stress.
METHODS: Colon histology, transcriptomics, and microbiota profiling of faecal
samples was performed on wild type, Muc2, and Muc2 mice at 2, 4, and 8 weeks of
age.
RESULTS: Muc2 mice develop colitis in proximal colon after weaning, resulting in 
inflammatory and adaptive immune responses, and expression of genes associated
with human inflammatory bowel disease. Muc2 mice do not develop colitis, but
produce a thinner mucus layer. The transcriptome of Muc2 mice revealed
differential expression of genes participating in mucosal stress responses and
exacerbation of a transient inflammatory state around the time of weaning. Young 
wild type and Muc2 mice have a more constrained group of bacteria as compared
with the Muc2 mice, but at 8 weeks the microbiota composition is more similar in 
all mice. At all ages, microbiota composition discriminated the groups of mice
according to their genotype. Specific bacterial clusters correlated with altered 
gene expression responses to stress and bacteria, before colitis development,
including colitogenic members of the genus Bacteroides.
CONCLUSIONS: The abundance of Bacteroides pathobionts increased before
histological signs of pathology suggesting they may play a role in triggering the
development of colitis. The Muc2 mouse produces a thinner mucus layer and can be 
used to study mucus barrier stress in the absence of colitis.

BACKGROUND: Cellular oxidative stress and genetic susceptibility have been
implicated in the multifactorial etiology of ulcerative colitis (UC). The nuclear
genome association with UC has been intensely investigated, but the role of the
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has received far less attention and may account for
part of the missing heritability. This study is a comprehensive analysis of the
mtDNA contribution to UC susceptibility.
METHODS: The association of mitochondrial single-nucleotide polymorphisms
(mtSNPs) and haplogroups with UC was tested in 488 cases and 833 controls of
European ancestry from the NIDDK IBD Genetics Consortium Ulcerative Colitis
Genome-Wide Association Study available through dbGaP and from the Illumina
Genotype Control Database (studies 64 and 65).
RESULTS: No evidence of population stratification could be detected using 218
ancestry informative markers for European Americans. Seven of the 58 tested
mtSNPs were nominally associated with UC, and A10550G in MT-ND4L withstands the
Bonferroni correction (P = 1.29E-06, odds ratio [ORG] [95% confidence interval
(CI)] = 4.80 [2.54-9.05], 10550G allele: 8.1% of patients and 1.9% of controls). 
A10550G remains equally associated after conditional analyses on the 11 UC
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) top SNPs (6.35E-07 < Pcond < 4.58E-06),
which suggests that it constitutes an independent risk factor from
nuclear-encoded susceptibility loci. We detected additive (but not
multiplicative) epistatic interactions between A10550G and all 11 top GWAS hits. 
Subhaplogroup K1 (P = 0.021, OR [95% CI] = 1.71 [1.08-2.69]) increased the risk
for UC, whereas the U5b lineage conferred protection (P = 0.016, OR [95% CI] =
0.34 [0.14-0.82]).
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that UC has a dual mitochondrial and nuclear
genetic control that warrants further replication in independent data sets and
reinforces its etiopathogenic complexity.

BACKGROUND: Intestinal microbiota play an important role in maintaining the
homeostasis of the host immune system. To analyze the alteration of the
intestinal microbial community structure in Korean Crohn's disease (CD) patients,
we performed a comparative metagenomic analysis between healthy people and CD
patients using fecal samples and mucosal tissues of ileocecal valve.
METHODS: 16S rRNA genes from fecal samples or mucosal tissues of 35 CD patients
and 15 healthy controls (HC) were amplified using a universal primer set and
sequenced with GS FLX Titanium. The microbial composition and diversity of each
sample were analyzed with the mothur pipeline, and the association between
microbial community and clinical characteristics of the patients were
investigated.
RESULTS: The contribution of bacterial groups to the intestinal microbial
composition differed between CD and HC, especially in fecal samples. Global
structure and individual bacterial abundance of intestinal microbial community
were different between feces and ileocecal tissues in HC. In CD patients with
active stage, relative abundances of Gammaproteobacteria and Fusobacteria were
higher in both fecal and mucosal tissue samples. Moreover, the intestinal
microbial community structure was altered by anti-tumor necrosis factor
(anti-TNF) treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Our 16S rRNA sequence data demonstrate intestinal dysbiosis at the
community level in Korean CD patients, which is similar to alterations of the
intestinal microbial community seen in the western counterparts. Clinical disease
activity and anti-TNF treatment might affect the intestinal microbial community
structure in CD patients.

Preterm birth is the leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality. Necrotizing
enterocolitis (NEC) is an inflammatory bowel disease affecting primarily
premature infants, which can be lethal. Microbial intestinal colonization may
alter epigenetic signatures of the immature gut establishing inflammatory and
barrier properties predisposing to the development of NEC. We hypothesize that a 
crosstalk exists between the epigenome of the host and the initial intestinal
colonizing microbiota at critical neonatal stages. By exposing immature
enterocytes to probiotic and pathogenic bacteria, we showed over 200 regions of
differential DNA modification, which were specific for each exposure.
Reciprocally, using a mouse model of prenatal exposure to dexamethasone we
demonstrated that antenatal treatment with glucocorticoids alters the epigenome
of the host. We investigated the effects on the expression profiles of genes
associated with inflammatory responses and intestinal barrier by qPCR-based gene 
expression array and verified the DNA modification changes in 5 candidate genes
by quantitative methylation specific PCR (qMSP). Importantly, by 16S RNA
sequencing-based phylogenetic analysis of intestinal bacteria in mice at 2 weeks 
of life, we showed that epigenome changes conditioned early microbiota
colonization leading to differential bacterial colonization at different
taxonomic levels. Our findings support a novel conceptual framework in which
epigenetic changes induced by intrauterine influences affect early microbial
colonization and intestinal development, which may alter disease susceptibility.

Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic, systemic, immune-mediated inflammation of the 
gastrointestinal tract. Originally described in 1932 as non-caseating
granulomatous inflammation limited to the terminal ileum, it is now recognized as
an expanding group of heterogeneous diseases defined by intestinal location,
extent, behavior, and systemic extraintestinal manifestations. Joint diseases,
including inflammatory spondyloarthritis and ankylosing spondylitis, are the most
common extraintestinal manifestations of CD and share more genetic susceptibility
loci than any other inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) trait. The high frequency
and overlap with genes associated with infectious diseases, specifically
Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases (MSMD), suggest that CD may
represent an evolutionary adaptation to environmental microbes. Elucidating the
diversity of the enteric microbiota and the protean mucosal immune responses in
individuals may personalize microbiome-targeted therapies and molecular
classifications of CD. This review will focus on CD's natural history and
therapies in the context of epigenetics, immunogenetics, and the microbiome.

We are currently in an exciting time when our understanding of genetic
underpinnings of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has undergone a revolution,
based in large part on novel genotyping and sequencing technologies. With >160
susceptible loci identified for IBD, the goal is now to understand at a
fundamental level the function of these susceptibility alleles. Determining the
clinical relevance of how these susceptible genes shape the development of IBD is
also a high priority. The main challenge is to understand how the environment and
microbiome play a role in triggering disease in genetically susceptible
individuals, as the interactions may be complex. To advance the field, novel in
vitro and mouse models that are designed to interrogate complex genetics and
functionally test hypotheses are needed. Ultimately, the goal of genetics studies
will be to translate genetics to patients with IBD and improve their care.

The pregnane X receptor (PXR) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) are two 
members of the nuclear receptor superfamily that regulate a broad range of genes 
involved in drug metabolism and transport. A variety of naturally occurring
compounds present in herbal medicines were identified as ligands of PXR and CAR. 
Recently, accumulative evidences have revealed the PXR- and CAR-mediated herbal
effect against multiple human diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD), cholestatic liver disease, and jaundice. The current review summarized the
recent progress in identifying the expanding libraries of herbal medicine as
ligands for PXR and CAR. Moreover, the potential for herbal medicines as
promising therapeutic agents which were mainly regulated through PXR/CAR
signaling pathways was also discussed. The discovery of herbal medicines as
modulators of PXR and CAR, and their PXR- and CAR-mediated effect on human
diseases will provide a basis for rational drug design, and eventually be
explored as a novel therapeutic approach against human diseases. This article is

Starting out as a model for developmental biology, during the last decade,
zebrafish have also gained the attention of the immunologists and oncologists.
Due to its small size, high fecundity and full annotation of its genome, the
zebrafish is an attractive model system. The fact that fish are transparent early
in life combined with the growing list of immune cell reporter fish, enables
in vivo tracking of immune responses in a complete organism. Since zebrafish
develop ex utero from a fertilized egg, immune development can be monitored from 
the start of life. Given that several gut functions and immune genes are
conserved between zebrafish and mammals, the zebrafish is an interesting model
organism to investigate fundamental processes underlying intestinal inflammation 
and injury. This review will first provide some background on zebrafish
intestinal development, bacterial colonization and immunity, showing the
similarities and differences compared to mammals. This will be followed by an
overview of the existing models for intestinal disease, and concluded by future
perspectives in light of the newest technologies and insights.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Anti-tumour necrosis factor [TNF] therapy is used in
patients with ulcerative colitis [UC], but not all patients respond to treatment.
Antimicrobial peptides [AMPs] and the gut microbiota are essential for gut
homeostasis and may be important for treatment outcome. The aim of this study was
to determine AMP and microbiota profiles in patients with UC before anti-TNF
therapy start and correlate these data to treatment outcome.
METHODS: Serum and biopsies were obtained from UC patients naïve to biological
therapy [n = 56] before anti-TNF therapy start [baseline]. Fecal samples were
taken at baseline and Weeks 2 and 6. Quantitative proteomic analysis was
performed in mucosal biopsies. Expression of AMPs and cytokines was determined in
biopsies and serum. Microbiota analysis of fecal samples was performed using
GA-map™ Dysbiosis Test and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction
[rtPCR]. Treatment response was evaluated 12-14 weeks after baseline.
RESULTS: At baseline, proteomic analysis of biopsies showed that treatment
responders and non-responders had differential expression of AMPs. Eleven AMP and
AMP-related genes were analysed by rtPCR in mucosal biopsies and could together
discriminate responders from non-responders at baseline. The most important
nominators for response were increased expression of defensin 5 and eosinophilic 
cationic protein. Microbiota analysis revealed lower dysbiosis indexes and higher
abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii in responders compared with
non-responders at baseline. Also, abundance of F. prausnitzii increased during
induction therapy in responders.
CONCLUSIONS: Anti-TNF therapy responders and non-responders display distinctly
separate patterns of mucosal AMP expression and gut microbiota before treatment
start. This indicates that intestinal antimicrobial/microbial composition can
influence treatment outcome.

BACKGROUND: Bacterial overgrowth is common complication of short bowel syndrome
(SBS) and is a result of an impaired gut barrier function. Toll-like receptor 4
(TLR4) is crucial in maintaining intestinal epithelial homeostasis, participates 
in a vigorous signaling process and heightens inflammatory cytokine output. The
objective of this study was to determine the effects of bowel resection on TLR4
signaling in intestinal mucosa in a rat model.
METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to one of the two
experimental groups of eight rats each: Sham rats underwent bowel transection and
re-anastomosis and SBS rats underwent 75 % small bowel resection. Rats were
killed on day 14. Bacterial translocation (BT) to mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, 
portal blood and peripheral blood was determined at the kill. The expression of
TLR4, MyD88 and TRAF6 in the intestinal mucosa was determined using real-time
PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: SBS rats demonstrated a 100 % BT to lymph nodes and to liver (Level I), 
80 % translocation to portal blood (Level II) and 60 % translocation to
peripheral blood (Level III) at day 7 as well as a 100 % BT to lymph nodes and
liver, and 40 % translocation to peripheral blood at day 14. Microarray
expression profiling demonstrated that most of the TLR signaling-related genes
were up-regulated in resected rats compared to control animals. SBS rats showed a
significant increase in TLR4 and TRAF6 mRNA in jejunum and ileum, TLR4 and MyD88 
protein expression in jejunum and ileum, and a significant increase in the number
of TLR4 and TRAF6 positive cells (immunohistochemistry) compared to sham animals.
CONCLUSIONS: In a rat model of SBS, elevated intestinal BT is associated with a
stimulated TLR4 signaling.

BACKGROUND: Mucosal barrier dysfunction is considered a critical component of
Crohn's disease (CD) pathogenesis after the identification of susceptibility
genes. However, the precise mechanism underlying mucosal barrier dysfunction has 
not yet been elucidated. We therefore aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanism 
underlying the expression of human α-defensin 6 (HD6) in patients with CD.
METHODS: HD6 expression was induced by the transfection of an atonal homolog 1
(Atoh1) transgene and was assessed by reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction. The HD6 promoter region targeted by Atoh1 and β-catenin was determined 
by reporter analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay.
HD5/HD6/Atoh1/β-catenin expression in noninflamed jejunal samples collected by
balloon endoscopy from 15 patients with CD and 9 non-inflammatory bowel disease
patients were assessed by immunofluorescence.
RESULTS: Both promoter activity and gene expression of HD6 was significantly
upregulated by the Atoh1 transgene in human colonic cancer cell line. We
identified a TCF4 binding site and an E-box site, critical for the regulation of 
HD6 transcriptional activity by directly binding of Atoh1 in the 200-bp HD6
promoter region. The treatment with β-catenin inhibitor also decreases HD6
promoter activity and gene expression. Moreover, HD6 expression, but not HD5
expression, was found to be decreased in noninflamed jejunal regions from
patients with CD. In HD6-negative crypts, nuclear accumulation of β-catenin was
impaired.
CONCLUSIONS: HD6 expression was found to be regulated by cooperation between
Atoh1 and β-catenin within the HD6 promoter region. Downregulation of HD6 in
noninflamed mucosa may contribute to mucosal barrier dysfunction of patients with
CD.

BACKGROUND: A dysregulated mucosal immune response to the intestinal environment 
in a genetically susceptible host is hypothesized to be critical to the
pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). Therefore, we examined CD-susceptibility
genes involved in the immune response through a genome-wide association study and
consecutive genotyping of human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) and killer cell
immunoglobulin-like receptors.
METHODS: An initial genome-wide association study was performed with 275 CD
patients and 2369 controls from a Korean population. To validate the loci
identified in the genome-wide association study, replication genotyping was
performed in a different cohort of 242 CD patients and 1066 controls. Finally,
high-resolution genotyping of HLA and killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor
was performed.
RESULTS: Four susceptibility loci, a promoter region in tumor necrosis factor
(ligand) superfamily member (TNFSF15) and 3 independent regions in HLAs, showed
significant associations with CD. Among them, rs114985235 in the intergenic
region between HLA-B and HLA-C showed the strongest association, with an
increased risk of CD (P = 8.71 × 10; odds ratio, 2.25). HLA typing in this region
showed HLA-C*01 to be responsible for the association of CD among 43 HLA-B and
HLA-C genotypes identified in the Korean population. However, the interaction of 
HLA-C with killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor had little effect on the
development of CD.
CONCLUSIONS: We newly identified HLA-C*01 as a prominent CD-susceptibility HLA
allotype in the Korean population. In addition, these results confirm that
genetic variations in immune response genes, such as HLAs and TNFSF15, are
important host factors for the pathogenesis of CD.

Post-translational modification (PTM) of nuclear receptor superfamily members
regulates various aspects of their biology to include sub-cellular localization, 
the repertoire of protein-binding partners, as well as their stability and mode
of degradation. The nuclear receptor pregnane X receptor (PXR, NR1I2) is a
master-regulator of the drug-inducible gene expression in liver and intestine.
The PXR-mediated gene activation program is primarily recognized to increase drug
metabolism, drug transport, and drug efflux pathways in these tissues. The
activation of PXR also has important implications in significant human diseases
including inflammatory bowel disease and cancer. Our recent investigations reveal
that PXR is modified by multiple PTMs to include phosphorylation, SUMOylation,
and ubiquitination. Using both primary cultures of hepatocytes and cell-based
assays, we show here that PXR is modified through acetylation on lysine residues.
Further, we show that increased acetylation of PXR stimulates its increased
SUMO-modification to support active transcriptional suppression. Pharmacologic
inhibition of lysine de-acetylation using trichostatin A (TSA) alters the
sub-cellular localization of PXR in cultured hepatocytes, and also has a profound
impact upon PXR transactivation capacity. Both the acetylation and SUMOylation
status of the PXR protein is affected by its ability to associate with the lysine
de-acetylating enzyme histone de-acetylase (HDAC)3 in a complex with silencing
mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT). Taken together,
our data support a model in which a SUMO-acetyl 'switch' occurs such that
acetylation of PXR likely stimulates SUMO-modification of PXR to promote the
active repression of PXR-target gene expression. This article is part of a

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Several transport alterations have been described in
intestinal inflammatory diseases. This is relevant because the primary function
of the intestine is nutrient and mineral absorption. However, analysis of the
transportome as a whole and the effect of commensal bacteria on it have not been 
addressed so far.
METHODS: Five healthy and 6 Crohn's disease (CD) samples were hybridized to human
HT-12 V4 Illumina GeneChip. Results were validated by reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis and with additional
array data. Organ culture assays were performed from mucosa ileal wall specimens 
collected at surgery. Samples were incubated with or without commensal bacteria
for 4 hours. Finally, RNA was isolated for microarray processing.
RESULTS: The analysis of CD versus healthy ileal mucosa demonstrated upregulation
of previously described genes involved in immunity and the inflammatory response 
in this disease. Interestingly, whole transcriptional analysis revealed profound 
alterations in the transportome profile. Sixty-two solute carrier (SLC)
transporters displayed different expression patterns, most of them being
downregulated. Changes were confirmed by RT-PCR in a randomly chosen subset of
SLCs. A large number of amino acid transporters and most members of the enteric
purinome were found to be altered. Most of these proteins were found at the
apical membrane of the enterocyte, which could impair both amino acid absorption 
and purinergic signalling. Treatment of ileum specimen explants with commensal
bacteria restored almost all CD transportome alterations.
CONCLUSIONS: These results describe the altered transportome profile in CD and
open the possibility of restoring transportome complications with commensal
bacteria.

One of the susceptibility genes in Crohn's disease (CD) is CARD15. Our study
examined the relationship between peripheral CARD15 expression and phenotype and 
duration of CD, treatment methods and inflammatory indices. Sixty patients with
CD and 30 healthy volunteers as controls were enrolled in the study. Total RNA
was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with E.Z.N.A. Total 
RNA Kit (Omega Bio-tek) then quantitative real-time PCR was performed on the ABI 
Prism 7900 HT Real-Time PCR System. CARD15 gene expression in PBMCs in CD was
significantly higher than in the control group. The highest level of gene
expression was found in CD patients in the fourth decade of life. The mRNA level 
of the CARD15 gene was higher in patients with disease duration between 12 and 60
months. A positive correlation was found between erythrocyte sedimentation rate
(ESR) and gene expression level. Gene expression increased with increasing level 
of C-reactive protein and ESR, but it was not statistically significant. CARD15
expression significantly decreased in CD patients treated with anti-TNFα agents
compared to azathioprine or steroid treatment groups. Expression of the CARD15
gene in Crohn›s disease is higher than in healthy individuals. Disease duration
and age of patients seem to be the most important factors influencing CARD15
expression.

BACKGROUND: The impact of genetic variation in the thiopurine S-methyltransferase
(TPMT) gene on thiopurine-induced leukopenia has been well demonstrated. Although
xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) is the second major contributor to azathioprine
breakdown, polymorphisms in XDH have rarely been studied in IBD patients. We aim 
to access association between XDH variants and thiopurine-induced leukopenia by
gene-gene interaction in a Crohn's disease (CD) population.
STUDY: A total of 964 CD patients treated with thiopurines were recruited from a 
tertiary referral center. The association between four XDH variants (p.Gly172Arg,
p.Asn1109Thr, p.Arg149Cys, and p.Thr910Lys) and thiopurine-induced leukopenia was
analyzed in cases with early leukopenia (n = 66), late leukopenia (n = 264), and 
in controls without leukopenia (n = 632). Three non-synonymous SNPs, which we
previously reported association with thiopurine-induced leukopenia, NUDT15
(p.Arg139Cys), SUCLA2 (p.Ser199Thr), and TPMT *3C were selected for epistasis
analysis with the XDH variants.
RESULTS: There was no significant association for two variants of XDH and
thiopurine-induced leukopenia. In the epistasis analysis, only XDH (p.Asn1109Thr)
* SUCLA2 (p.Ser199Thr) showed a statistically significant association with early 
leukopenia [odds ratio (OR) = 0.16; p = 0.03]. After genotype stratification, a
positive association on the background of SUCLA2 wild-type (199Ser) between the
XDH (p.Asn1109Thr) and early leukopenia (OR = 4.39; p = 0.01) was detected.
CONCLUSION: Genes associated with thiopurine-induced leukopenia can act in a
complex interactive manner. Further studies are warranted to explore the
mechanisms underlying the effects of the combination of XDH (p.Asn1109Thr) and
SUCLA2 (199Ser) on thiopurine-induced leukopenia.

BACKGROUND PROMOTER: hypermethylation plays a major role in cancer through
transcriptional silencing of critical genes. The aim of our study is to evaluate 
the methylation status of these genes in the colonic mucosa without dysplasia or 
adenocarcinoma at the different steps of sporadic and UC-related carcinogenesis
and to investigate the possible role of genomic methylation as a marker of
CRC.RESULTS: The expression of Dnmts 1 and 3A was significantly increased in
UC-related carcinogenesis compared to non inflammatory colorectal carcinogenesis.
In non-neoplastic colonic mucosa, the number of methylated genes resulted
significantly higher in patients with CRC and in those with UC-related CRC
compared to the HC and UC patients and patients with dysplastic lesion of the
colon. The number of methylated genes in non-neoplastic colonic mucosa predicted 
the presence of CRC with good accuracy either in non inflammatory and
inflammatory related CRC.
METHODS: Colonic mucosal samples were collected from healthy subjects (HC) (n =
30) and from patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) (n = 29), UC and dysplasia (n 
= 14), UC and cancer (n = 10), dysplastic adenoma (n = 14), and colon
adenocarcinoma (n = 10). DNA methyltransferases-1, -3a, -3b, mRNA expression were
quantified by real time qRT-PCR. The methylation status of CDH13, APC, MLH1,
MGMT1 and RUNX3 gene promoters was assessed by methylation-specific PCR.
CONCLUSIONS: Methylation status of APC, CDH13, MGMT, MLH1 and RUNX3 in the
non-neoplastic mucosa may be used as a marker of CRC: these preliminary results
could allow for the adjustment of a patient's surveillance interval and to select
UC patients who should undergo intensive surveillance.

BACKGROUND: Glutathione S-transferases (GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1) and
methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) are important enzymes for protection 
against oxidative stress. In addition, MTHFR has an essential role in DNA
synthesis, repair, and methylation. Their polymorphisms have been implicated in
the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC). The aim of the present study was to 
investigate the role of selected polymorphisms in these genes in the development 
of UC in the Moldavian population.
METHODS: In a case-control study including 128 UC patients and 136 healthy
individuals, GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes (polymorphic deletions) were determined
using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The GSTP1 rs1695 (Ile105Val),
MTHFR rs1801133 (C677T), and MTHFR rs1801131 (A1298C) polymorphisms were studied 
with restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. Genotype-phenotype
correlations were examined using logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: None of the genotypes, either alone or in combination, showed a strong
association with UC. The case-only sub-phenotypic association analysis showed an 
association of the MTHFR rs1801133 polymorphism with the extent of UC under
co-dominant (p corrected = 0.040) and recessive (p corrected = 0.020; OR = 0.15; 
CI = 0.04-0.63) genetic models. Also, an association between the MTHFR rs1801131 
polymorphism and the severity of UC was reported for the over-dominant model (p
corrected = 0.023; coefficient = 0.32; 95% CI = 0.10-0.54).
CONCLUSION: The GST and MTHFR genotypes do not seem to be a relevant risk factor 
for UC in our sample. There was, however, evidence that variants in MTHFR may
influence the clinical features in UC patients. Additional larger studies
investigating the relationship between GST and MTHFR polymorphisms and UC are
required.

Inflammatory rheumatic diseases are characterized by inflammation resulting from 
the immune dysregulation that usually attacks joints, skin and internal organs.
Many of them are considered as complex disease that may be predisposed by
multiple genes and/or genetic loci, and triggered by environmental factors such
as microbiome and cellular stress. The major histocompatibility complex class I
chain-related gene A (MICA) is a highly polymorphic gene that encodes protein
variants expressed under cellular stress conditions, and these MICA variants play
important roles in immune activation and surveillance. Recently, accumulating
evidences from both genetic and functional studies have suggested that MICA
polymorphisms may be associated with various rheumatic diseases, and the
expression of MICA variants may attribute to the altered immune responses in the 
diseases. The objective of this review is to discuss potential genetic
associations and pathological relevance of MICA in inflammatory rheumatic
diseases that may help us to understand pathogenesis contributing to the
development of these diseases.

An endoscopic examination is currently the most reliable method for monitoring
disease activity in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However,
endoscopic evaluations are unable to detect mucosal inflammation at the earliest 
stages. The present study aimed to evaluate the molecular profiles of inflamed
and unaffected colon mucosa from patients with mild Crohn's disease (CD) and
ulcerative colitis (UC), in order to identify a more sensitive method for
monitoring mucosal impairment. Patients were recruited and colon biopsies from
the inflamed and the normal‑appearing mucosa of patients with mild IBD were
obtained by colonoscopy. Gene expression analysis was performed using
microarrays, after which Gene Ontology and clustering were performed using
bioinformatics. In addition, the levels of inflammatory cytokines were analyzed
by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction. A total of 620
genes in the inflamed and 210 genes in the unaffected colon mucosa with at least 
a 3‑fold change, as compared with healthy controls, were detected in patients
with mild CD, and 339 genes in the inflamed and 483 genes in the unaffected colon
mucosa were detected in patients with mild UC. Heat mapping demonstrated a
similarity in the gene alteration patterns, and altered transcripts overlapped,
between the inflamed and unaffected colon mucosa. Interferon‑γ and interleukin‑17
mRNA levels were comparably elevated in the inflamed and unaffected colon mucosa 
from patients with IBD. Marked gene expression alterations were detected in the
inflamed and unaffected colon mucosa from patients with mild IBD, and these
showed marked similarity and overlap between the two groups. The results of the
present study suggested that inflammation was not limited to the endoscopic
lesions and that gene expression profiling may be considered a sensitive tool for
monitoring mucosal inflammation, predicting relapses and optimizing therapeutic
strategies for patients with IBD.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha is a major proinflammatory cytokine involved in
the immune response in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Anti-TNF drugs such as
infliximab and adalimumab are used to treat IBD; however, approximately 30% of
patients do not respond to treatment. Individual genetic differences could
contribute to lack of efficacy. Genetic studies have tried to uncover the factors
underlying differences in response, however, knowledge remains limited, and the
results obtained should be validated, so that pharmacogenetic information can be 
applied in clinical practice. In this review, we gather current knowledge in the 
pharmacogenetics of anti-TNF drugs in patients with IBD. We observed a connection
between the major genes described as possible predictors of response to anti-TNF 
drugs in IBD and the cytokines and molecules involved in the T helper (Th) 17
pathway.

Idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative
colitis (UC), are multifactorial diseases that are manifested after disruption of
a genetic predisposed individual and its intestinal microflora through an
environmental stimulus. Urbanization and industrialization are associated with
IBD. Epidemiological data, clinical observations and family/immigrants studies
indicate the significance of environmental influence in the development of IBD.
Some environmental factors have a different effect on the subtypes of IBD.
Smoking and appendectomy is negatively associated with UC, but they are
aggravating factors for CD. A westernized high fat diet, full of refined
carbohydrates is strongly associated with the development of IBD, contrary to a
high in fruit, vegetables and polyunsaturated fatty acid-3 diet that is
protective against these diseases. High intake of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory
drug and oral contraceptive pills as well as the inadequacy of vitamin D leads to
an increased risk for IBD and a more malignant course of disease. Moreover, other
factors such as air pollution, psychological factors, sleep disturbances and
exercise influence the development and the course of IBD. Epigenetic mechanism
like DNA methylation, histone modification and altered expression of miRNAS could
explain the connection between genes and environmental factors in triggering the 
development of IBD.

Pregnane X receptor (PXR) is a major transcriptional regulator of xenobiotic
metabolism and transport pathways in the liver and intestines, which are critical
for protecting organisms against potentially harmful xenobiotic and endobiotic
compounds. Inadvertent activation of drug metabolism pathways through PXR is
known to contribute to drug resistance, adverse drug-drug interactions, and drug 
toxicity in humans. In both humans and rodents, PXR has been implicated in
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, diabetes, obesity, inflammatory bowel disease,
and cancer. Because of PXR's important functions, it has been a therapeutic
target of interest for a long time. More recent mechanistic studies have shown
that PXR is modulated by multiple PTMs. Herein we provide the first investigation
of the role of acetylation in modulating PXR activity. Through LC-MS/MS analysis,
we identified lysine 109 (K109) in the hinge as PXR's major acetylation site.
Using various biochemical and cell-based assays, we show that PXR's acetylation
status and transcriptional activity are modulated by E1A binding protein (p300)
and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). Based on analysis of acetylation site mutants, we found
that acetylation at K109 represses PXR transcriptional activity. The mechanism
involves loss of RXRα dimerization and reduced binding to cognate DNA response
elements. This mechanism may represent a promising therapeutic target using
modulators of PXR acetylation levels. This article is part of a Special Issue
entitled: Xenobiotic nuclear receptors: New Tricks for An Old Dog, edited by Dr.

Factors linking inflammation and cancer are of great interest. We now report that
the chromatin-targeting E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF20/RNF40, driving histone H2B
monoubiquitylation (H2Bub1), modulates inflammation and inflammation-associated
cancer in mice and humans. Downregulation of RNF20 and H2Bub1 favors recruitment 
of p65-containing nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) dimers over repressive p50 homodimers
and decreases the heterochromatin mark H3K9me3 on a subset of NF-κB target genes 
to augment their transcription. Concordantly, RNF20(+/-) mice are predisposed to 
acute and chronic colonic inflammation and inflammation-associated colorectal
cancer, with excessive myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) that may quench
antitumoral T cell activity. Notably, colons of human ulcerative colitis
patients, as well as colorectal tumors, reveal downregulation of RNF20/RNF40 and 
H2Bub1 in both epithelium and stroma, supporting the clinical relevance of our
tissue culture and mouse model findings.

The complex interplay between symbiotic bacteria and host immunity plays a key
role in shaping intestinal homeostasis and maintaining host health. Paneth cells,
as one of the major producers of antimicrobial peptides in the intestine under
steady-state conditions, play a vital role in regulating intestinal flora. Many
studies on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-associated genes have put Paneth
cells at the center of IBD pathogenesis. In this perspective, we focus on
mechanistic studies of different cellular processes in Paneth cells that are
regulated by various IBD-associated susceptibility genes, and we discuss the
hypothesis that Paneth cells function as the central hub for sensing and
regulating intestinal flora in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis.

Congenital Sodium Diarrhea: A Form of Intractable Diarrhea, With a Link to

Congenital diarrheal disorders (CDDs) represent a group of challenging clinical
conditions for pediatricians because of the severity of the presentation and the 
broad range of possible differential diagnoses. CDDs arise from alterations in
the transport of nutrients and electrolytes across the intestinal mucosa, from
enterocyte and enteroendocrine cell differentiation and/or polarization defects, 
and from the modulation of the intestinal immune response. Advances were made
recently in deciphering the etiology and pathophysiology of one of these
disorders, congenital sodium diarrhea (CSD). CSD refers to an intractable
diarrhea of intrauterine onset with high fecal sodium loss. CSD is clinically and
genetically heterogeneous. A syndromic form of CSD features choanal and
intestinal atresias as well as recurrent corneal erosions. Small bowel histology 
frequently detects an epithelial "tufting" dysplasia. It is autosomal recessively
inherited, and caused by SPINT2 mutations. The nonsyndromic form of CSD can be
caused by dominant activating mutations in GUCY2C, encoding intestinal receptor
guanylate cyclase C (GC-C), and by autosomal recessive SLC9A3 loss-of-function
mutations. SLC9A3 encodes Na/H antiporter 3, the major intestinal brush border
Na/H exchanger, and a downstream target of GC-C. A number of patients with GUCY2C
and SLC9A3 mutations developed inflammatory bowel disease. Both the number of
recognized CDD forms as well as the number of underlying disease genes are
gradually increasing. Knowledge of these CDD genes enables noninvasive,
next-generation gene panel-based testing to facilitate an early diagnosis in CDD.
Primary Na/H antiporter 3 and GC-C malfunction is implicated as a predisposition 
for inflammatory bowel disease in subset of patients.

BACKGROUND: Although deleterious mutations in interleukin-10 and its receptor
molecules cause severe infantile-onset inflammatory bowel disease, there are no
reports of mutations affecting this signaling pathway in Japanese patients. Here 
we report a novel exonic mutation in the IL10RA gene that caused unique splicing 
aberrations in a Japanese patient with infantile-onset of inflammatory bowel
disease in association with immune thrombocytopenic purpura and a transient
clinical syndrome mimicking juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.
CASE PRESENTATION: A Japanese boy, who was the first child of non-consanguineous 
healthy parents, developed bloody diarrhea, perianal fistula, and folliculitis in
early infancy and was diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease. He also
developed immune thrombocytopenic purpura and transient features mimicking
juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. The patient failed to respond to various
treatments, including elemental diet, salazosulfapyridine, metronidazole,
corticosteroid, infliximab, and adalimumab. We identified a novel mutation
(c.537G > A, p.T179T) in exon 4 of the IL10RA gene causing unique splicing
aberrations and resulting in lack of signaling through the interleukin-10
receptor. At 21 months of age, the patient underwent allogeneic hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation and achieved clinical remission.
CONCLUSIONS: We describe a novel exonic mutation in the IL10RA gene resulting in 
infantile-onset inflammatory bowel disease. This mutation might also be involved 
in his early-onset hematologic disorders. Physicians should be familiar with the 
clinical phenotype of IL-10 signaling defects in order to enable prompt diagnosis
at an early age and referral for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation.

BACKGROUND: Replication study is a commonly used verification method to filter
out false positives in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). If an association 
can be confirmed in a replication study, it will have a high confidence to be
true positive. To design a replication study, traditional approaches calculate
power by treating replication study as another independent primary study. These
approaches do not use the information given by primary study. Besides, they need 
to specify a minimum detectable effect size, which may be subjective. One may
think to replace the minimum effect size with the observed effect sizes in the
power calculation. However, this approach will make the designed replication
study underpowered since we are only interested in the positive associations from
the primary study and the problem of the "winner's curse" will occur.
RESULTS: An Empirical Bayes (EB) based method is proposed to estimate the power
of replication study for each association. The corresponding credible interval is
estimated in the proposed approach. Simulation experiments show that our method
is better than other plug-in based estimators in terms of overcoming the winner's
curse and providing higher estimation accuracy. The coverage probability of given
credible interval is well-calibrated in the simulation experiments. Weighted
average method is used to estimate the average power of all underlying true
associations. This is used to determine the sample size of replication study.
Sample sizes are estimated on 6 diseases from Wellcome Trust Case Control
Consortium (WTCCC) using our method. They are higher than sample sizes estimated 
by plugging observed effect sizes in power calculation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our new method can objectively determine replication study's sample 
size by using information extracted from primary study. Also the winner's curse
is alleviated. Thus, it is a better choice when designing replication studies of 
GWAS. The R-package is available at: http://bioinformatics.ust.hk/RPower.html .

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Specific members of the RING finger [RNF] protein family
serve as E3 ubiquitin ligases and play important roles in the regulation of
inflammation. However, their roles in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel
disease [IBD] have not been explored.
METHODS: Genomic microarray of inflamed colon samples from Crohn's disease [CD]
patients was performed to identify potential up-regulated genes. Expression of
the identified highly up-regulated RNF183 gene was subsequently examined by
quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [qRT-PCR], western
blotting and immunohistochemistry of the intestinal tissues of IBD patients and
the colons of trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid [TNBS]-induced colitic mice.
RNF183-mediated interaction with the NF-κB pathway and ubiquitination of IκBα
were examined by siRNA, plasmid transfection, and immunoprecipitation. The miRNA 
predicted to target RNF183 was explored and its role in the RNF183/ NF-κB pathway
was investigated.
RESULTS: RNF183 was up-regulated in intestinal epithelial cells in IBD patients
and in colitic mice. RNF183 promoted intestinal inflammation via the activation
of the NF-κB pathway by increasing the ubiquitination and degradation of IκBα.
Computational analysis identified putative binding of miR-7 to RNF183.
Transfection of intestinal cells with a miR-7 mimic or inhibitor confirmed its
negative regulatory effect on RNF183 expression and ubiquitination of IκBα. miR-7
was down-regulated in inflamed colon tissues of IBD patients and colitic mice.
CONCLUSIONS: RNF183, which is negatively regulated by miR-7, is a novel regulator
promoting intestinal inflammation by increasing the ubiquitination and
degradation of IκBα, thereby inducing NF-κB activation. The interaction between
RNF183-mediated ubiquitination and miRNA may be an important novel epigenetic
mechanism in the pathogenesis of IBD.

Previous work has shown that the gene DMBT1, which encodes a large secreted
epithelial glycoprotein known as salivary agglutinin, gp340, hensin or muclin, is
an innate immune defence protein that binds bacteria. A deletion variant of DMBT1
has been previously associated with Crohn's disease, and a DMBT1(-/-) knockout
mouse has increased levels of colitis induced by dextran sulphate. DMBT1 has a
complex copy number variable structure, with two, independent, rapidly mutating
copy number variable regions, called CNV1 and CNV2. Because the copy number
variable regions are predicted to affect the number of bacteria-binding domains, 
different alleles may alter host-microbe interactions in the gut. Our aim was to 
investigate the role of this complex variation in susceptibility to Crohn's
disease by assessing the previously reported association. We analysed the
association of both copy number variable regions with presence of Crohn's
disease, and its severity, on three case-control cohorts. We also reanalysed
array comparative genomic hybridisation data (aCGH) from a large case-control
cohort study for both copy number variable regions. We found no association with 
a linear increase in copy number, nor when the CNV1 is regarded as presence or
absence of a deletion allele. Taken together, we show that the DMBT1 CNV does not
affect susceptibility to Crohn's disease, at least in Northern Europeans.

Region and cell-type specific differences in the molecular make up of colon
epithelial cells have been reported. Those differences may underlie the
region-specific characteristics of common colon epithelial diseases such as
colorectal cancer and inflammatory bowel disease. DNA methylation is a cell-type 
specific epigenetic mark, essential for transcriptional regulation, silencing of 
repetitive DNA and genomic imprinting. Little is known about any region-specific 
variations in methylation patterns in human colon epithelial cells. Using
purified epithelial cells and whole biopsies (n= 19) from human subjects, we
generated epigenome-wide DNA methylation data (using the HELP-tagging assay),
comparing the methylation signatures of the proximal and distal colon. We
identified a total of 125 differentially methylated sites (DMS) mapping to
transcription start sites of protein-coding genes, most notably several members
of the homeobox (HOX) family of genes. Patterns of differential methylation were 
validated with MassArray EpiTYPER. We also examined DNA methylation in whole
biopsies, applying a computational technique to deconvolve variation in
methylation within cell types and variation in cell-type composition across
biopsies. Including inferred epithelial proportions as a covariate in
differential methylation analysis applied to the whole biopsies resulted in
greater overlap with the results obtained from purified epithelial cells compared
with when the covariate was not included. Results obtained from both approaches
highlight region-specific methylation patterns of HOX genes in colonic
epithelium. Regional variation in methylation patterns has implications for the
study of diseases that exhibit regional expression patterns in the human colon,
such as inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory disease of
the intestine. IBD is a multifactorial disorder, and IBD-associated genes are
critical in innate immune response, inflammatory response, autophagy, and
epithelial barrier integrity. Moreover, epithelial oxygen tension plays a
critical role in intestinal inflammation and resolution in IBD. The intestines
have a dynamic and rapid fluctuation in cellular oxygen tension, which is
dysregulated in IBD. Intestinal epithelial cells have a steep oxygen gradient
where the tips of the villi are hypoxic and the oxygenation increases at the base
of the villi. IBD results in heightened hypoxia throughout the mucosa. Hypoxia
signals through a well-conserved family of transcription factors, where
hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and HIF-2α are essential in maintaining
intestinal homeostasis. In inflamed mucosa, HIF-1α increases barrier protective
genes, elicits protective innate immune responses, and activates an antimicrobial
response through the increase in β-defensins. HIF-2α is essential in maintaining 
an epithelial-elicited inflammatory response and the regenerative and
proliferative capacity of the intestine following an acute injury. HIF-1α
activation in colitis leads to a protective response, whereas chronic activation 
of HIF-2α increases the pro-inflammatory response, intestinal injury, and cancer.
In this mini-review, we detail the role of HIF-1α and HIF-2α in intestinal
inflammation and injury and therapeutic implications of targeting HIF signaling
in IBD.

NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) deficiency causes ectodermal dysplasia with
immunodeficiency in males, while manifesting as incontinentia pigmenti in
heterozygous females. We report a family with NEMO deficiency, in which a female 
carrier displayed skewed X-inactivation favoring the mutant NEMO allele
associated with symptoms of Behçet's disease. Hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation of an affected boy from this donor reconstituted an immune system
with retained skewed X-inactivation. After transplantation no more severe
infections occurred, indicating that an active wild-type NEMO allele in only 10% 
of immune cells restores host defense. Yet he developed inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD). While gut infiltrating immune cells stained strongly for nuclear
p65 indicating restored NEMO function, this was not the case in intestinal
epithelial cells - in contrast to cells from conventional IBD patients. These
results extend murine observations that epithelial NEMO-deficiency suffices to
cause IBD. High anti-TNF doses controlled the intestinal inflammation and
symptoms of Behçet's disease.

BACKGROUND: Anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) biologic associated psoriasis 
has been reported in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. However, little
is known regarding its pathogenesis.
AIM: To identify potential genetic predispositions to anti-TNF associated
psoriasis in IBD patients.
METHODS: This retrospective chart review included IBD patients enrolled in a
prospective registry. Cases of anti-TNF associated psoriasis and idiopathic
psoriasis unrelated to anti-TNF exposure were confirmed by an expert
dermatologist. All patients were genotyped on the Illumina Immunochip. A weighted
genetic risk score ascertaining genetic pre-disposition towards psoriasis was
calculated and overall genetic pre-disposition as well as differential
distribution of individual polymorphisms was compared across the three groups.
RESULTS: Our study included 724 IBD patients who initiated anti-TNF therapy and
did not develop psoriasis, 35 patients with anti-TNF associated psoriasis, and 38
patients with idiopathic psoriasis. Anti-TNF users who developed psoriasis had a 
modest but statistically significantly greater psoriasis genetic risk score than 
anti-TNF controls (mean 0.64 vs. 0.61, P = 0.04), and had a similar genetic risk 
score as those with idiopathic psoriasis (0.64 vs. 0.62, P = 0.22). Two loci
associated with NOS2 and ETS1 genes achieved P < 0.05 when comparing anti-TNF
associated psoriasis to anti-TNF controls. Three loci were significantly
different between anti-TNF associated psoriasis and idiopathic psoriasis
including a polymorphism near NOS2 encoding for inducible nitric oxide synthase
that is produced by dendritic cells in skin lesions in psoriasis.
CONCLUSION: Patients with anti-TNF associated psoriasis had a modestly greater
genetic pre-disposition towards psoriasis but no single causative polymorphism
was identified.

Sixty-eight hospital-admitted patients with a first episode of Clostridium
difficile infection (CDI) were included and followed up during 1 year. Faeces
samples were collected at 1, 2, 6 and 12 months after inclusion and analyzed for 
the presence of C. difficile toxin B, genes for toxin A, toxin B, binary toxin
and TcdC deletion by PCR. All strains were also PCR-ribotyped and the MICs of the
isolates were determined against eight antimicrobial agents. In 68 patients
initially included, antibiotics, clinical signs and co-morbidities were analyzed 
and 56 were evaluable for recurrences. The mean number of different antibiotics
given during 3 months prior to inclusion was 2.6 (range 0-6). Six patients had
not received any antibiotics and three of them had diagnosed inflammatory bowel
disease. Thirty-two patients (57%) had either a microbiological or clinical
recurrence, 16 of whom had clinical recurrences that were confirmed
microbiologically (13, 23%) or unconfirmed by culture (3, 5%). Twenty-nine
patients were positive in at least one of the follow-up tests, 16 had the same
ribotype in follow-up tests, i.e. relapse, and 13 a different ribotype, i.e.,
reinfection. Most common ribotypes were 078/126, 020, 023, 026, 014/077, 001 and 
005. No strain of ribotype 027 was found. Strains ribotype 078/126 and 023 were
positive for binary toxin and were the strains most prone to cause recurrence.
All strains were sensitive to vancomycin and metronidazole. Patients with
recurrences were significantly older (p = 0.02) and all patients had a high
burden of comorbidities, which could explain the high fatality rate, 26 (38%)
patients died during the 1-year follow-up.

BACKGROUND: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most frequent life-threatening
gastrointestinal disease experienced by premature infants in neonatal intensive
care units. The challenge for neonatologists is to detect early clinical
manifestations of NEC. One strategy would be to identify specific markers that
could be used as early diagnostic tools to identify preterm infants most at risk 
of developing NEC or in the event of a diagnostic dilemma of suspected disease.
As a first step in this direction, we sought to determine the specific gene
expression profile of NEC.
METHODS: Deep sequencing (RNA-Seq) was used to establish the gene expression
profiles in ileal samples obtained from preterm infants diagnosed with NEC and
non-NEC conditions. Data were analyzed with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and
ToppCluster softwares.
RESULTS: Data analysis indicated that the most significant functional pathways
over-represented in NEC neonates were associated with immune functions, such as
altered T and B cell signaling, B cell development, and the role of pattern
recognition receptors for bacteria and viruses. Among the genes that were
strongly modulated in neonates with NEC, we observed a significant degree of
similarity when compared with those reported in Crohn's disease, a chronic
inflammatory bowel disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Gene expression profile analysis revealed a predominantly altered
immune response in the intestine of NEC neonates. Moreover, comparative analysis 
between NEC and Crohn's disease gene expression repertoires revealed a
surprisingly high degree of similarity between these two conditions suggesting a 
new avenue for identifying NEC biomarkers.

Epidemiological studies showed that 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D[1,25(OH)2D3]
insufficiency appears to be associated with aging and colon cancer while
underlying biological mechanisms remain largely unknown. Inflammatory bowel
disease is one of the risk factors for colon cancer. In this study, we
investigated whether 1,25(OH)2D3 deficiency has an impact on the colon of
25-hydroxyvitamin D 1α-hydroxylase knockout [Cyp27b1(-/-)] mice fed on a rescue
diet (high calcium, phosphate, and lactose) from weaning to 10 months of age. We 
found that 1,25(OH)2D3 deficient mice displayed significant colon inflammation
phenotypes including shortened colon length, thinned and disordered mucosal
structure, and inflammatory cell infiltration. DNA damage, cellular senescence
and the production of senescence-associated inflammatory cytokines were also
increased significantly in the colon of Cyp27b1(-/-)mice. Furthermore, the levels
of ROS in the colon were increased significantly, whereas the expression levels
of antioxidative genes were down-regulated dramatically in the colon of
Cyp27b1(-/-)mice. Taken together, our results demonstrated that 1,25(OH)2D3
deficiency could induce colon inflammation, which may result from increased
oxidative stress and DNA damage, subsequently, induced cell senescence and
overproduction of senescence-associated secretory factors. Therefore, our
findings suggest that 1,25(OH)2D3 may play an important role in preventing the
development and progression of colon inflammation and colon cancer.

BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) consists of two main
disease-subtypes, Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC); these
subtypes share overlapping genetic and clinical features. Genome-wide microarray 
data enable unbiased documentation of alterations in gene expression that may be 
disease-specific. As genetic diseases are believed to be caused by genetic
alterations affecting the function of signalling pathways, module-centric
optimisation algorithms, whose aim is to identify sub-networks that are
dys-regulated in disease, are emerging as promising approaches.
RESULTS: In order to account for the topological structure of molecular
interaction networks, we developed an optimisation algorithm that integrates
databases of known molecular interactions with gene expression data; such
integration enables identification of differentially regulated network modules.
We verified the performance of our algorithm by testing it on simulated networks;
we then applied the same method to study experimental data derived from
microarray analysis of CD and UC biopsies and human interactome databases. This
analysis allowed the extraction of dys-regulated subnetworks under different
experimental conditions (inflamed and uninflamed tissues in CD and UC).
Optimisation was performed to highlight differentially expressed network modules 
that may be common or specific to the disease subtype.
CONCLUSIONS: We show that the selected subnetworks include genes and pathways of 
known relevance for IBD; in particular, the solutions found highlight cross-talk 
among enriched pathways, mainly the JAK/STAT signalling pathway and the EGF
receptor signalling pathway. In addition, integration of gene expression with
molecular interaction data highlights nodes that, although not being
differentially expressed, interact with differentially expressed nodes and are
part of pathways that are relevant to IBD. The method proposed here may help
identifying dys-regulated sub-networks that are common in different diseases and 
sub-networks whose dys-regulation is specific to a particular disease.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an immune-related disease with genetic predisposition.
The aim of this study was to investigate the association of three polymorphisms
in the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) gene with UC risk in a
Chinese population. This case-control study involved 72 UC patients and 479 age- 
and gender-matched healthy controls. Genotyping was performed using the
polymerase chain reaction-ligase detection reaction method. Data were analyzed
using the Haplo.stats program. There were no significant differences between
patients and controls in the allele/genotype distributions of rs1800624
(P(allele)= 0.11; Pgenotype = 0.20), rs1800625 (P(allele) = 0.16; Pgenotype =
0.11), or rs2070600 (P(allele) = 0.37; Pgenotype = 0.65). In addition, no
positive haplotypes were identified. To the best of our knowledge, the current
study describes polymorphisms of RAGE in Chinese UC for the first time. We found 
no association between RAGE polymorphisms and the development of UC in the
Chinese population.

BACKGROUND: Major advances in genotyping technology have generated high-density
maps of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers that provide an
unprecedented opportunity to identify genes underlying complex traits. Several
family-based statistical methods showing robust population stratification have
been developed to test the association between multiple markers and
disease-susceptibility genes. Only a few methods focus on testing for maternally 
mediated genetic effects, which is a critical risk for birth defects. The present
study focuses on testing for association and maternally mediated genetic effects 
with family-based methods.
RESULTS: In the present study, we proposed a new method, max_PC integrating
principal component analysis, to test association or maternally mediated genetic 
effects with case-parent data. The proposed method only uses the genotypes of
case-parents triads and accommodates missing SNP data. Our results demonstrated
that this method is powerful to test association or maternally mediated genetic
effects and attractive because it provides a tool for testing the null hypothesis
of no association and no maternally mediated genetic effects. Simulations with
the permutation procedure as well as an application in the Crohn's disease study 
showed that the type I error rates of the proposed statistic were nominal with
slightly higher power as compared to those of the max_Z(2) test.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the max_PC is a good approach to test association
or maternally mediated genetic effects.

BACKGROUND: Immuno-compromised mice infected with Helicobacter typhlonius are
used to model microbially inducted inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The specific
mechanism through which H. typhlonius induces and promotes IBD is not fully
understood. Access to the genome sequence is essential to examine emergent
properties of this organism, such as its pathogenicity. To this end, we present
the complete genome sequence of H. typhlonius MIT 97-6810, obtained through
single-molecule real-time sequencing.
RESULTS: The genome was assembled into a single circularized contig measuring
1.92 Mbp with an average GC content of 38.8%. In total 2,117 protein-encoding
genes and 43 RNA genes were identified. Numerous pathogenic features were found, 
including a putative pathogenicity island (PAIs) containing components of type IV
secretion system, virulence-associated proteins and cag PAI protein. We compared 
the genome of H. typhlonius to those of the murine pathobiont H. hepaticus and
human pathobiont H. pylori. H. typhlonius resembles H. hepaticus most with 1,594 
(75.3%) of its genes being orthologous to genes in H. hepaticus. Determination of
the global methylation state revealed eight distinct recognition motifs for
adenine and cytosine methylation. H. typhlonius shares four of its recognition
motifs with H. pylori.
CONCLUSION: The complete genome sequence of H. typhlonius MIT 97-6810 enabled us 
to identify many pathogenic features suggesting that H. typhlonius can act as a
pathogen. Follow-up studies are necessary to evaluate the true nature of its
pathogenic capabilities. We found many methylated sites and a plethora of
restriction-modification systems. The genome, together with the methylome, will
provide an essential resource for future studies investigating gene regulation,
host interaction and pathogenicity of H. typhlonius. In turn, this work can
contribute to unraveling the role of Helicobacter in enteric disease.

Glucocorticosteroids (GCs) are used for many years as first-line drugs for the
achievement of remission in exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
However, close to 20% of patients are resistant to GCs, and 40% of patients
become dependent on GCs. The challenge of today's personalized medicine is the
anticipation of the steroid therapy effects even before the initiation of
treatment. As several studies show, individually variable response to GCs in
population has a genetic background and may depend on gene variability encoding
proteins involved in the function and metabolism of GCs. To those genes belong:
NR3C1--responsible for the synthesis of GC receptor (GR); Hsp90, HSP70, STIP1,
FKB5--genes of GR protein complex; ABCB1 and IPO13 coding glycoprotein p170; and 
importin 13--involved in GCs transport; IL1A, IL1B, IL2, IL4, IL8, IL10, TNF, and
MIF--genes of the epithelial pro-inflammatory factors synthesis, which excessive 
activation causes steroid resistance as well as CYP3A4 and CYP3A5--encoding GCs
biotransformation enzymes. This work systematizes and sums up the state of
current knowledge in the field of pharmacogenetics as well as expectations for
the future in the realm of individualized medicine in IBD patients treated with
GC drugs.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship of skeletal muscle FNDC5 mRNA
expression and circulating irisin to the GH/IGF-I axis and to skeletal muscle
mitochondrial function and mitochondria-related gene expression in obese men.
DESIGN: Fifteen abdominally obese men with reduced growth hormone received
12weeks of recombinant human GH (rhGH). Before and after treatment, they
underwent (31)P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy to evaluate phosphocreatine (PCr)
recovery as a measure of mitochondrial function and skeletal muscle biopsy to
assess expression of mitochondrial-related genes. Serum irisin and IGF-I and
skeletal muscle FNDC5 and IGF-I mRNA were measured.
RESULTS: At baseline, skeletal muscle FNDC5 mRNA was significantly and positively
associated with IGF-I mRNA (ρ=0.81, P=0.005) and rate of PCr recovery (ρ=0.79,
P=0.006). Similar relationships of circulating irisin to IGF-I mRNA (ρ=0.63,
P=0.05) and rate of PCr recovery (ρ=0.48, P=0.08) were demonstrated, but were not
as robust as those with muscle FNDC5 expression. Both serum irisin and skeletal
muscle FNDC5 mRNA were significantly associated with PPARγ (ρ=0.73, P=0.02 and
ρ=0.85, P=0.002), respectively. In addition, FNDC5 mRNA was correlated with
skeletal muscle PGC-1α (ρ=0.68, P=0.03), NRF1 (ρ=0.66, P=0.04) and TFAM (ρ=0.79, 
P=0.007) mRNA. Neither serum irisin nor muscle mRNA expression of FNDC5 changed
with rhGH treatment.
CONCLUSION: These novel data in skeletal muscle demonstrate that local expression
of FNDC5 is associated with mRNA expression of IGF-I and mitochondrial function
and mitochondria-related gene expression in obese subjects with reduced growth
hormone and suggest a potential role for FNDC5 acting locally in muscle in a low 
GH state. Further studies are needed to clarify the relationship between the
GH/IGF-I axis and irisin.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been widely used for identifying
common variants associated with complex diseases. Despite remarkable success in
uncovering many risk variants and providing novel insights into disease biology, 
genetic variants identified to date fail to explain the vast majority of the
heritability for most complex diseases. One explanation is that there are still a
large number of common variants that remain to be discovered, but their effect
sizes are generally too small to be detected individually. Accordingly, gene set 
analysis of GWAS, which examines a group of functionally related genes, has been 
proposed as a complementary approach to single-marker analysis. Here, we propose 
a FL: exible and A: daptive test for G: ene S: ets (FLAGS), using summary
statistics. Extensive simulations showed that this method has an appropriate type
I error rate and outperforms existing methods with increased power. As a proof of
principle, through real data analyses of Crohn's disease GWAS data and bipolar
disorder GWAS meta-analysis results, we demonstrated the superior performance of 
FLAGS over several state-of-the-art association tests for gene sets. Our method
allows for the more powerful application of gene set analysis to complex
diseases, which will have broad use given that GWAS summary results are
increasingly publicly available.

RATIONALE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) susceptibility is in part
related to genetic variants. Most genetic studies have been focused on
genome-wide common variants without a specific focus on coding variants, but
common and rare coding variants may also affect COPD susceptibility.
OBJECTIVES: To identify coding variants associated with COPD.
METHODS: We tested nonsynonymous, splice, and stop variants derived from the
Illumina HumanExome array for association with COPD in five study populations
enriched for COPD. We evaluated single variants with a minor allele frequency
greater than 0.5% using logistic regression. Results were combined using a fixed 
effects meta-analysis. We replicated novel single-variant associations in three
additional COPD cohorts.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We included 6,004 control subjects and 6,161 COPD 
cases across five cohorts for analysis. Our top result was rs16969968
(P = 1.7 × 10(-14)) in CHRNA5, a locus previously associated with COPD
susceptibility and nicotine dependence. Additional top results were found in
AGER, MMP3, and SERPINA1. A nonsynonymous variant, rs181206, in IL27
(P = 4.7 × 10(-6)) was just below the level of exome-wide significance but
attained exome-wide significance (P = 5.7 × 10(-8)) when combined with results
from other cohorts. Gene expression datasets revealed an association of rs181206 
and the surrounding locus with expression of multiple genes; several were
differentially expressed in COPD lung tissue, including TUFM.
CONCLUSIONS: In an exome array analysis of COPD, we identified nonsynonymous
variants at previously described loci and a novel exome-wide significant variant 
in IL27. This variant is at a locus previously described in genome-wide
associations with diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and obesity and appears
to affect genes potentially related to COPD pathogenesis.

The bacterial cells harbored within the human gastrointestinal tract (GIT)
outnumber the host's cells by a factor of 10 and the genes encoded by the
bacteria resident within the GIT outnumber their host's genes by more than 100
times. These human digestive-tract associated microbes are referred to as the gut
microbiome. The human gut microbiome and its role in both health and disease has 
been the subject of extensive research, establishing its involvement in human
metabolism, nutrition, physiology, and immune function. Imbalance of the normal
gut microbiota have been linked with gastrointestinal conditions such as
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and wider
systemic manifestations of disease such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and atopy.
In the first part of this review, we evaluate our evolving knowledge of the
development, complexity, and functionality of the healthy gut microbiota, and the
ways in which the microbial community is perturbed in dysbiotic disease states;
the second part of this review covers the role of interventions that have been
shown to modulate and stabilize the gut microbiota and also to restore it to its 
healthy composition from the dysbiotic states seen in IBS, IBD, obesity, type 2
diabetes, and atopy.

Background. Patients with UC have shown an important defect in the secretion and 
maintenance of the mucosal barrier as part of inadequate expression of mucin
genes. The aim of the present study was to determine the expression of MUC12,
MUC16, and MUC20 in colonic tissue from patients with UC in regard to their
clinical outcomes. Methods. We included a total of 40 patients with UC and 30
normal controls. Mucin gene expression was performed by RT-PCR and protein
expression was detected by immunohistochemistry. Results. Patients with active UC
showed no significant expression of MUC12 gene in mucosa compared to the group of
patients with UC in remission and the normal control group. MUC16 gene expression
was significantly increased in the UC active and remission groups compared to the
normal control group (P = 0.03). MUC20 gene expression was found significantly
decreased in patients with active UC compared to both remission group (P = 0.001)
and normal controls (P = 0.001). Furthermore, an association was found between
MUC20 gene expression and the presence of histological remission in patients with
UC (P = 0.003, OR = 0.37). Conclusions. An increased gene expression of MUC16 and
MUC20 was found in patients with remission UC.

Crohn's disease (CD) is an immune-mediated inflammatory bowel disease, in which
inflammation is driven by a complex interaction between the microbiota, immune
cells, genes and mediators. New mechanisms of action and several cytokines have
been identified as factors involved in the inflammatory process in CD, and many
new molecules have been developed to treat this complex disease. New agents have 
been developed that target leukocyte trafficking, block or adhesion molecules for
example, as well as the development of antibodies against classic inflammatory
cytokines or therapies directed against IL-12/23 and Janus kinases. The
development of selective mechanisms of action and targeting of different
cytokines or inflammatory mediators for each patient presents the biggest
challenge for the future in CD therapy. Such agents are currently at different
phases of development. We aim to review the current literature data on a targeted
approach in CD, which could be promising alternative approach for CD patients in 
the near future.

Chronic inflammatory disorders are thought to arise due to an interplay between
predisposing host genetics and environmental factors. For example, the onset of
inflammatory bowel disease is associated with enteric proteobacterial infection, 
yet the mechanistic basis for this association is unclear. We have shown
previously that genetic defiency in TLR1 promotes acute enteric infection by the 
proteobacteria Yersinia enterocolitica. Examining that model further, we
uncovered an altered cellular immune response that promotes the recruitment of
neutrophils which in turn increases metabolism of the respiratory electron
acceptor tetrathionate by Yersinia. These events drive permanent alterations in
anti-commensal immunity, microbiota composition, and chronic inflammation, which 
persist long after Yersinia clearence. Deletion of the bacterial genes involved
in tetrathionate respiration or treatment using targeted probiotics could prevent
microbiota alterations and inflammation. Thus, acute infection can drive long
term immune and microbiota alterations leading to chronic inflammatory disease in
genetically predisposed individuals.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: A long duration of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) increases 
the risk for colorectal cancer. Mutation analysis of limited numbers of genes has
indicated that colorectal tumors that develop in patients with IBD differ from
those of patients without IBD. We performed whole-exome sequencing analyses to
characterize the genetic landscape of these tumors.
METHODS: We collected colorectal tumor and non-neoplastic tissues from 31
patients with IBD and colorectal cancer (15 with ulcerative colitis, 14 with
Crohn's disease, and 2 with indeterminate colitis) and performed whole-exome
sequencing analyses of the microdissected tumor and matched nontumor tissues. We 
identified somatic alterations by comparing matched specimens. The prevalence of 
mutations in sporadic colorectal tumors was obtained from previously published
exome-sequencing studies.
RESULTS: Two specimens had somatic mutations in the DNA proofreading or mismatch 
repair genes POLE, MLH1, and MSH6 and the tumor cells had a hypermutable
phenotype. The remaining tumors had, on average, 71 alterations per sample. TP53 
was the most commonly mutated gene, with prevalence similar to that of sporadic
colorectal tumors (63% of cases). However, tumors from the patients with IBD had 
a different mutation spectrum. APC and KRAS were mutated at significantly lower
rates in tumors from patients with IBD than in sporadic colorectal tumors (13%
and 20% of cases, respectively). Several genes were mutated more frequently or
uniquely in tumors from patients with IBD, including SOX9 and EP300 (which encode
proteins in the WNT pathway), NRG1 (which encodes an ERBB ligand), and IL16
(which encodes a cytokine). Our study also revealed recurrent mutations in
components of the Rho and Rac GTPase network, indicating a role for noncanonical 
WNT signaling in development of colorectal tumors in patients with IBD.
CONCLUSIONS: Colorectal tumors that develop in patients with IBD have distinct
genetic features from sporadic colorectal tumors. These findings could be used to
develop disease-specific markers for diagnosis and treatment of patients with IBD
and colorectal cancer.

Evidence obtained from gene knockout studies supports the role of Toll-like
receptor 4 (TLR4) in intestinal inflammation and microbiota recognition.
Increased epithelial TLR4 expression is observed in patients with inflammatory
bowel disease. However, little is known of the effect of increased TLR4 signaling
on intestinal homeostasis. Here, we examined the effect of increased TLR4
signaling on epithelial function and microbiota by using transgenic villin-TLR4
mice that overexpress TLR4 in the intestinal epithelium. Our results revealed
that villin-TLR4 mice are characterized by increases in the density of
mucosa-associated bacteria and bacterial translocation. Furthermore, increased
epithelial TLR4 signaling was associated with an impaired epithelial barrier,
altered expression of antimicrobial peptide genes, and altered epithelial cell
differentiation. The composition of the colonic luminal and mucosa-associated
microbiota differed between villin-TLR4 and wild-type (WT) littermates.
Interestingly, WT mice cohoused with villin-TLR4 mice displayed greater
susceptibility to acute colitis than singly housed WT mice did. The results of
this study suggest that epithelial TLR4 expression shapes the microbiota and
affects the functional properties of the epithelium. The changes in the
microbiota induced by increased epithelial TLR4 signaling are transmissible and
exacerbate dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis. Together, our findings imply
that host innate immune signaling can modulate intestinal bacteria and ultimately
the host's susceptibility to colitis.

Recent advances have shown that the abnormal inflammatory response observed in CD
involves an interplay among intestinal microbiota, host genetics and
environmental factors. The escalating consumption of fat and sugar in Western
countries parallels an increased incidence of CD during the latter 20(th)
century. The impact of a HF/HS diet in mice was evaluated for the gut
micro-inflammation, intestinal microbiota composition, function and selection of 
an E. coli population. The HF/HS diet created a specific inflammatory environment
in the gut, correlated with intestinal mucosa dysbiosis characterized by an
overgrowth of pro-inflammatory Proteobacteria such as E. coli, a decrease in
protective bacteria, and a significantly decreased of SCFA concentrations. The
expression of GPR43, a SCFA receptor was reduced in mice treated with a HF/HS
diet and reduced in CD patients compared with controls. Interestingly, mice
treated with an agonist of GPR43 were protected against DSS-induced colitis.
Finally, the transplantation of feces from HF/HS treated mice to GF mice
increased susceptibility to AIEC infection. Together, our results demonstrate
that a Western diet could aggravate the inflammatory process and that the
activation of the GPR43 receptor pathway could be used as a new strategy to treat
CD patients.

SLC44A4 is one of the seven novel susceptibility genes that were discovered in
the first ever genome-wide association study (GWAS) on ulcerative colitis (UC) in
the genetically distinct north Indians. This gene seems to be functionally
relevant to disease biology as it may contribute to the associated phenotype of
Vitamin B1 deficiency among UC patients, hence playing a role in disease
pathogenesis. A large number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are known 
to be distributed throughout this gene, but the functional status of most are not
known. Thus, an extensive investigation of structural and regulatory variants
within this gene was undertaken in this study to identify the critical variants
amongst them using a combination of fine mapping, in silico and in vitro
approaches. A few intronic SNPs were predicted to have regulatory roles on the
basis of in silico analysis, suggesting that they may be the critical variants
within SLC44A4. This highlights the importance of this gene in UC biology, thus
confirming the finding of the GWAS and also warranting additional studies.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been highly successful in
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with 163 confirmed associations so far. We used 
expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping to analyze IBD associated
regions for which causative gene from the region is still unknown. First, we
performed an extensive literature search and in silico analysis of published GWAS
in IBD and eQTL studies and extracted 402 IBD associated SNPs assigned to 208
candidate loci, and 9562 eQTL correlations. When crossing GWA and eQTL data we
found that for 50 % of loci there is no eQTL gene, while for 31.2 % we can
determine one gene, for 11.1 % two genes and for the remaining 7.7 % three or
more genes. Based on that we selected loci with one, two, and three or more eQTL 
genes and analyzed them in peripheral blood lymphocytes and intestine tissue
samples of 606 Slovene patients with IBD and in 449 controls. Association
analysis of selected SNPs showed statistical significance for three (rs2631372
and rs1050152 on 5q locus and rs13294 on 1q locus) out of six selected SNPs with 
at least one phenotype. Furthermore, with eQTL analysis of selected chromosomal
regions, we confirmed a link between SNP and gene for four (SLC22A5 on 5q, ECM1
on 1q, ORMDL3 on 17q, and PUS10 on 2p locus) out of five selected regions. For
1q21 loci, we confirmed gene ECM1 as the most plausible gene from this region to 
be involved in pathogenesis of IBD and thereby contributed new eQTL correlation
from this genomic region.

PURPOSE: Thiopurine-induced leukopenia is a relatively common adverse event
related to thiopurine medication in Korean pediatric Crohn's disease. In addition
to the mutations of TPMT gene, the NUDT15 c.415C>T variant was recently
identified to have a strong association with thiopurine-induced early leukopenia.
We conducted this study to define the incidence of azathioprine (AZA)-related
leukopenia and to determine the incidence and characteristics of their genetic
variants in Korean pediatric Crohn's disease patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with pediatric Crohn's disease who had
used AZA for more than 3 months were recruited. The dose and duration of
medication and data regarding adverse events including leukopenia were collected.
TPMT and NUDT15 gene sequencing was performed for patients who had experienced
AZA-induced leukopenia.
RESULTS: A total of 81 patients had used AZA as a maintenance therapy of Crohn's 
disease. The mean dose of AZA was 1.88±0.39 mg/kg/day. Nine patients (11.1%)
experienced AZA-induced leukopenia, and eight patients (9.9%) experienced
AZA-induced early leukopenia. Among the eight early leukopenia patients, six
patients (75.0%) harbored the NUDT15 c.415C>T variant and one patient (12.5%) had
the TPMT c.719A>G (TPMT*3C) variant. All the three patients with NUDT15 c.415C>T 
homozygous variant suffered from alopecia totalis, and two of them experienced
severe systemic infection. Three patients with the NUDT15 heterozygous variant
are currently treated with AZA at a dose of 0.76 mg/kg/day.
CONCLUSION: Mutations of the NUDT15 and TPMT gene accounted for ∼88% of cases
with thiopurine-induced early leukopenia. Extensive hair loss was a recognizable 
early symptom in patients with the homozygous NUDT15 c.415C>T variant. Sequencing
of the NUDT15 genes can guide the clinicians before thiopurine medication. An
alternative immunosuppressive medication is recommended for patients with
homozygous NUDT15 c.415C>T variant. For those with the heterozygous variant, half
the usual dose of AZA can achieve efficacy comparable to that for wild-type
patients.

Genome wide association studies have identified several genes that might be
associated with increase susceptibility to Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) and Crohn's
disease. Both Crohn's disease and T1D have a profound impact on the lives of
patients and it is pivotal to investigate the genetic role in patients acquiring 
these diseases. Understanding the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNP's) in key genes in patients suffering from T1D and Crohn's disease is
crucial to finding an effective treatment and generating novel therapeutic drugs.
This review article is focused on the impact of SNP's in PTPN2 (protein tyrosine 
phosphatase, non-receptor type 2) and PTPN22 (protein tyrosine phosphatase
non-receptor type 22) on the development of Crohn's disease and T1D. The PTPN2
gene mutation in T1D patients play a direct role in the destruction of beta cells
while in Crohn's disease patients, it modulates the innate immune responses. The 
PTPN22 gene mutations also play a role in both diseases by modulating
intracellular signaling. Examining the mechanism through which these genes
increase the susceptibility to both diseases and gaining a better understanding
of their structure and function is of vital importance to understand the etiology
and pathogenesis of Type 1 Diabetes and Crohn's disease.

Regulatory T (Treg) cells are essential for maintenance of peripheral tolerance
and prevention of autoimmune diseases in part by producing immunosuppressive
cytokines. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have also been involved in autoimmune
disorders, not least for their crucial role in the regulation of Treg biology and
function. We simultaneously investigated the concentration of IL-35, IL-10,
TGF-β, and sCD25 in supernatant of cell culture and the expression patterns of
several miRNAs in CD4(+)CD25(+) CD127(-/low) FoxP3(+) Tregs of ulcerative colitis
(UC) patients. Significantly lower levels of IL-10 and IL-35 were observed in
Treg cultures of UC patients. miR-21, miR-146a, and miR-155 levels were
downregulated and miR-31 level was upregulated in Tregs of patients. Our results 
suggest that microRNAs may serve as a novel regulator in function and
homoeostasis of UC Treg cells, providing a key role for them in pathophysiology
of UC.

Dysbiosis is a hallmark of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but it is unclear
which specific intestinal bacteria predispose to and which protect from IBD and
how they are regulated. Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (Pglyrps) are
antibacterial, participate in maintaining intestinal microflora, and modulate
inflammatory responses. Mice deficient in any one of the four Pglyrp genes are
more sensitive to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, and stools from
Pglyrp-deficient mice transferred to wild type (WT) germ-free mice predispose
them to much more severe colitis than stools from WT mice. However, the
identities of these Pglyrp-regulated bacteria that predispose Pglyrp-deficient
mice to colitis or protect WT mice from colitis are not known. Here we identified
significant changes in β-diversity of stool bacteria in Pglyrp-deficient mice
compared with WT mice. The most consistent changes in microbiome in all
Pglyrp-deficient mice were in Bacteroidales, from which we selected four species,
two with increased abundance (Prevotella falsenii and Parabacteroides distasonis)
and two with decreased abundance (Bacteroides eggerthii and Alistipes
finegoldii). We then gavaged WT mice with stock type strains of these species to 
test the hypothesis that they predispose to or protect from DSS-induced colitis. 
P. falsenii, P. distasonis, and B. eggerthii all enhanced DSS-induced colitis in 
both WT mice with otherwise undisturbed intestinal microflora and in WT mice with
antibiotic-depleted intestinal microflora. By contrast, A. finegoldii (which is
the most abundant species in WT mice) attenuated DSS-induced colitis both in WT
mice with otherwise undisturbed intestinal microflora and in WT mice with
antibiotic-depleted intestinal microflora, similar to the colitis protective
effect of the entire normal microflora. These results identify P. falsenii, P.
distasonis, and B. eggerthii as colitis-promoting species and A. finegoldii as
colitis-protective species.

Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is chronic inflammatory disease involving joints and the 
spine. Bowel inflammation is common in SpA, which may be classified as acute or
chronic. Chronic gut inflammation is most common in SpA patients with axial
involvement as compared to those presenting with peripheral involvement alone.
The pathogenesis of gut inflammation in SpA could be explained by two
factors-over-activation of immunological cells and altered gut microbiome. This
is exemplified by SpA animal models, namely HLA-B27-expressing transgenic animals
and SKG mice models. Immunological mechanisms include homing of activated T cells
from gut into synovium, excess pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion by immune
cells such as IL-23 and genetic variations in immunological genes. The evidence
for role of gut microbiome in SpA is gradually emerging. Recently, metagenomic
study of gut microbiome by sequencing of microbial nucleic acids has enabled
identification of new microbial taxa and their functions in gut of patients with 
SpA. In SpA, the gut microbiome could emerge as diagnostic and prognostic marker 
of disease. Modulation of gut microbiome is slated to have therapeutic potential 
as well.

This study aimed to explore whether the functional CD24 A57V and TG/del
polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to autoimmune diseases. A
meta-analysis was conducted on the associations between the CD24 A57V and TG/del 
polymorphisms and autoimmune diseases using (1) allele contrast, and (2) the
recessive, (3) dominant, and (4) co-dominant models. Twenty-six comparative
studies with 7,507 patients and 8,803 controls were included in the
meta-analysis. The meta-analysis revealed a significant association between
autoimmune disease and the CD24 Val allele (OR = 1.285, 95% CI = 1.177-1.403, p =
1.0 × 10-9). Meta-analysis by autoimmune disease type showed a significant
association between the CD24 Val allele and multiple sclerosis (MS) (OR = 1.420, 
95% CI = 1.239-1.628, p = 4.7 × 10-8) and systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) (OR =
1.282, 95% CI = 1.081-1.521, p = 0.004), but not Crohn's disease (CD) (OR =
1.003, 95% CI = 0.826-1.218, p = 0.974). Meta-analysis of the CD24 Val/Val
genotype showed an association with ulcerative colitis (OR = 1.778, 95% CI =
1.148-2.753, p = 0.010). In addition, meta-analysis by autoimmune disease type
revealed a significant association between the CD24 TG-deletion allele and MS (OR
= 0.596, 95% CI = 0.415-0.856, p = 0.005) and CD (OR = 1.594, 95% CI =
1.175-2.161, p = 0.003). This meta-analysis indicates that the functional CD24
A57V and TG/del polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to multiple
autoimmune diseases including SLE, MS, UC and CD.

Cytokines and chemokines are predominant players in the progression of
inflammatory bowel diseases. While systemic neutralization of these players with 
antibodies works well in some patients, serious contraindications and side
effects have been reported. Therefore, the local interference of cytokine
signaling mediated by siRNA-loaded nanoparticles might be a promising new
therapeutic approach. In this study, we produced multi-shell nanoparticles
consisting of a calcium phosphate (CaP) core coated with siRNA directed against
pro-inflammatory mediators, encapsulated into poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide acid)
(PLGA), and coated with a final outer layer of polyethyleneimine (PEI), for the
local therapeutic treatment of colonic inflammation. In cell culture,
siRNA-loaded CaP/PLGA nanoparticles exhibited a rapid cellular uptake, almost no 
toxicity, and an excellent in vitro gene silencing efficiency. Importantly,
intrarectal application of these nanoparticles loaded with siRNA directed against
TNF-α, KC or IP-10 to mice suffering from dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced
colonic inflammation led to a significant decrease of the target genes in colonic
biopsies and mesenteric lymph nodes which was accompanied with a distinct
amelioration of intestinal inflammation. Thus, this study provides evidence that 
the specific and local modulation of the inflammatory response by CaP/PLGA
nanoparticle-mediated siRNA delivery could be a promising approach for the
treatment of intestinal inflammation.

BACKGROUND: The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and
ulcerative colitis (UC), result from the combined effects of susceptibility genes
and environmental factors. Previous studies have shown that polymorphisms in the 
Toll-like receptor (TLR), the apoptosis, the IL-23/IL-17 and the interferon gamma
(IFNG) pathways are associated with risk of both CD and UC.
METHODS: Using a candidate gene approach, 21 functional single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in 15 genes were assessed in a clinical homogeneous group of
severely diseased ethnic Danish patients consisting of 624 patients with CD, 411 
patients with UC and 795 controls. The results were analysed using logistic
regression.
RESULTS: The polymorphisms TLR5 (rs5744174) and IL12B (rs6887695) were associated
with risk of CD, and TLR1 (rs4833095) and IL18 (rs187238) were associated with
risk of both CD and UC (p<0.05). After Bonferroni correction for multiple
testing, the homozygous variant genotype of TLR1 743 T>C (rs4833095) was
associated with increased risk CD (OR: 3.15, 95% CI: 1.59-6.26, p = 0.02) and CD 
and UC combined (OR: 2.96, 95% CI: 1.64-5.32, p = 0.005).
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that genetically determined high activity of TLR1
and TLR5 was associated with increased risk of both CD and UC and CD,
respectively. This supports that the host microbial composition or environmental 
factors in the gut are involved in risk of IBD. Furthermore, genetically
determined high activity of the IL-23/IL-17 pathway was associated with increased
risk of CD and UC. Overall, our results support that genetically determined high 
inflammatory response was associated with increased risk of both CD and UC.

BACKGROUND: TNF-α antagonists such as infliximab are effective for the treatment 
of inflammatory bowel disease and other inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.
Development of an immune response and subsequent neutralizing antibodies against 
these protein-based drugs is a major impediment that contributes to therapeutic
failure, or adverse effects such as hypersensitivity reactions. As opposed to
empirical dose-escalation strategies, rational and cost-effective evaluation of
clinical non-responsiveness includes measurement of serum drug levels, and
detection of drug-specific antibodies. We present the validation and 2-y
experience using a functional, cell-based reporter gene assay (RGA) developed for
measuring the biological activity and antibody response to serum infliximab.
METHODS: The RGA was used to test 4699 clinical specimens from patients suspected
of therapeutic failure. In contrast to binding assays, which detect an overall
antibody response, the RGA specifically detects those antibodies that have
drug-neutralizing function, and thus, poses higher risk for therapeutic failure.
RESULTS: The RGA presented here is currently the only functional clinical test
available to measure serum infliximab activity and neutralizing antibodies.
CONCLUSIONS: Due to its accuracy and precision, and suitability for
high-throughput testing, this robust platform can be applied to any TNF-α
antagonist, providing an invaluable tool for the clinical management of patients 
with treatment failure.

Inflammation-induced jejunal cell death and oxidative stress have been observed
in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but now, there is still no systematic animal
model of jejunal oxidative stress for the evaluation of potential therapies.
Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the dynamic changes of
pro-inflammatory cytokines and antioxidant expression on the jejunal
inflammation. In this study, Hydrogen peroxide(H2O2, 10 ml/kg)was administrated
intragastrically to mice in a single dose of 1%, 3%, or 5%. The incidence of
death, histomorphometry, inflammatory cytokines (including TNF-α,IL-1β,and IL-5),
and antioxidant genes were measured via RT-PCR. During the whole period, a
massive infiltration of neutrophils was observed in the jejunum. Intragastric
administration of H2O2 significantly up-regulated the expression of TNF-α,IL-1β, 
and IL-5 (P<0.05). Meanwhile, 5% H2O2 induced an acute stress in mice which
lasted up to 3 days, while 3% H2O2 induced a chronic injury in the jejunum that
lasted 7 days. In the early stage, H2O2 markedly enhanced expression of
antioxidant genes and all of the doses used progressively decreased the
expression of antioxidant genes in a time-dependent manner. These findings
suggested that intragastric administration of 3% H2O2 induces relatively stable
oxidative stress in the jejunum.

The multifactorial chronic inflammatory disease periodontitis, which is
characterized by destruction of tooth-supporting tissues, has also been
implicated as a risk factor for various systemic diseases. Although periodontitis
has been studied extensively, neither disease-specific biomarkers nor therapeutic
targets have been identified, nor its link with systemic diseases. Here, we
analyzed the global transcriptome of periodontitis and compared its gene
expression profile with those of other inflammatory conditions, including
cardiovascular disease (CVD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and ulcerative colitis
(UC). Gingival biopsies from 62 patients with periodontitis and 62 healthy
subjects were subjected to RNA sequencing. The up-regulated genes in
periodontitis were related to inflammation, wounding and defense response, and
apoptosis, whereas down-regulated genes were related to extracellular matrix
organization and structural support. The most highly up-regulated gene was mucin 
4 (MUC4), and its protein product was confirmed to be over-expressed in
periodontitis. When comparing the expression profile of periodontitis with other 
inflammatory diseases, several gene ontology categories, including inflammatory
response, cell death, cell motion, and homeostatic processes, were identified as 
common to all diseases. Only one gene, pleckstrin (PLEK), was significantly
overexpressed in periodontitis, CVD, RA, and UC, implicating this gene as an
important networking link between these chronic inflammatory diseases.

Studies investigating the association between Interleukin-23 receptor (IL-23R)
gene polymorphisms and Crohn's disease (CD) report conflicting results. Thus, a
meta-analysis was carried out to assess the association between the IL-23R
polymorphisms and CD. A systematic literature search was conducted to identify
all relevant studies. Pooled odds ratio (ORs) with 95% confidence interval (CIs) 
was used to estimate the strength of association. Finally, a total of 60
case-control studies in 56 articles, involving 22,820 CD patients and 27,401
healthy controls, were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, a significant
association was found between all CD and the rs7517847 polymorphism (OR = 0.699, 
95% CI = 0.659 ~ 0.741, P < 0.001). Meta-analysis of the rs11209026, rs1343151,
rs10489629 and rs11465804 polymorphisms indicated the same pattern as for
rs7517847. Meta-analysis showed an association between the rs10889677A allele and
CD (OR = 1.393, 95% CI = 1.328 ~ 1.461, P < 0.001). Similarly, meta-analysis of
the rs2201840, rs1004819, rs1495965 and rs11209032 polymorphisms revealed the
same pattern as that shown by meta-analysis of rs10889677. Stratification by
ethnicity revealed that IL-23R gene polymorphisms were associated with CD in the 
Caucasian group, but not in Asians. In summary, the meta-analysis suggests a
significant association between IL-23R polymorphisms and CD, especially in
Caucasians.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: The serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) terminates
serotonin activity by removing it from interstitial space. Downregulated colonic 
SERT expression has been reported in irritable bowel disease (IBS), and symptoms 
resembling IBS occur in cases of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in remission;
thus, a common pathogenesis for IBS and IBD is possible. However, little is known
regarding SERT expression in colonic mucosa of IBD patients during healing.
METHODS: Twenty-two ulcerative colitis (UC) patients underwent colonoscopy
examinations, during which inflamed mucosa was distinguished from that undergoing
healing. Healing mucosa was classified into regular and irregular vessel patterns
by narrowband imaging magnifying colonoscopy. Expressions of SERT and various
inflammation-related genes in biopsy samples were assessed using a polymerase
chain reaction array system and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Colitis
model mice were established by administration of dextran sodium sulfate or
transfer of CD4(+) T cells isolated from SAMP1 mice, then time-course changes of 
SERT and inflammatory gene expressions were observed in colonic mucosa.
RESULTS: In UC patients, SERT expression in inflamed mucosa was significantly
lower than in healing mucosa. SERT expression was decreased in healing mucosa
with an irregular vessel pattern with mildly increased levels of inflammatory
gene expression. In mice, SERT expression was suppressed in inflamed mucosa and
continuously observed with low-grade mucosal inflammation during colitis healing.
CONCLUSIONS: Sserotonin reuptake transporter expression is downregulated in
healing colonic mucosa of UC patients and that suppression may be dependent on
the presence of remaining low-grade colonic inflammation.

Tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA) (C19H18O3) is one of the major active lipophilic
components in a conventional Chinese medicine called danshen, and it has long
been used in the People's Republic of China and other neighboring countries to
treat patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Previous
experiments by many teams determined which mechanism of Tan IIA is relevant to
the treatment of IBD associated with inflammation and the pregnane X receptor
(PXR). The current study demonstrated that Tan IIA is an efficacious PXR agonist 
and its ability to induce CYP3A4 mRNA and protein expression was mediated by the 
transactivation of PXR, a known target of abrogating inflammation in IBD.
Clinical symptoms in mice and histological assessment data suggested that
administration of Tan IIA in mice demonstrated significant protection and showed 
that in DSS-induced IBD it acts in a concentration-dependent manner. PXR-silenced
mice treated with Tan IIA demonstrated low protection against DSS-induced mouse
IBD and exacerbated the severity of IBD compared with wild-type mice;
PXR-silenced mice demonstrated the necessity for PXR in Tan IIA-mediated
upregulation of xenobiotic metabolism genes. The IBD treatment effects of Tan IIA
are partially due to PXR-mediated upregulation of xenobiotic metabolism and
downregulation of inflammatory mediators. The novel findings reported here may
contribute to the effective utilization of Tan IIA and its derivatives as a PXR
ligand in the treatment of human IBD. This suggests that Tan IIA may have
considerable clinical utility.

PURPOSE: Inter-individual thiopurine metabolism variability can influence
treatment outcomes in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Genetic
polymorphisms in thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) and inosine triphosphate
pyrophosphatase (ITPA) were linked with toxicity of azathioprine (AZA). The aim
of the study was to investigate frequencies of TPMT and ITPA polymorphisms in
Lithuanian IBD patients and analyze their association with AZA-related adverse
events.
MATERIALS/METHODS: Polymorphisms in TPMT (TPMT*2,*3B,*3C,*3A) and ITPA
(rs1127354, rs7270101) genes were determined using PCR-RFLP and TaqMan(®)
genotyping assays. 551 consecutive Lithuanian IBD patients were genotyped. The
use of AZA and its side effects were assessed retrospectively according to
hospital medical records.
RESULTS: Frequencies of TPMT*3A, TPMT*3B and TPMT*3C alleles were 3.1%, 0.5% and 
0.1%, respectively. TPMT*2 genetic variant was not detected in the study group.
The distribution of minor alleles for ITPA rs1127354 and rs7270101 polymorphisms 
was 9.9% and 10.5%, respectively. AZA was prescribed in 82 patients and it
provoked myelotoxicity in 11%, hepatotoxicity in 6.1%, dyspepsia in 6.1%, and
pancreatitis in 3.6% of cases. Among patients who had AZA-related myelotoxicity, 
11.1% were TPMT compound heterozygous, 44.4% had heterozygous genotype (P<0.01). 
Frequencies of ITPA minor alleles were similar among the patients with and
without AZA-related side effects.
CONCLUSION: Frequencies of TPMT and ITPA variant alleles in Lithuanian IBD group 
were similar to those observed in the Northern-Eastern Europe Caucasian
populations. Polymorphisms in TPMT might be associated with myelotoxicity and
leukopenia in AZA treated patients, while ITPA variant alleles appear not to be
linked with treatment-related side effects.

BACKGROUND: Aggressive course and resistance to treatments usually characterize
very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD). Some VEO-IBD cases are due
to monogenic immune defects and can benefit from hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (HSCT).
CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a Caucasian male baby who presented in the first
months of life macrophage activation syndrome, followed by intractable colitis,
recurrent episodes of fever and mild splenomegaly. After several immunological,
genetic and clinical investigations, subsequently a therapeutic attempt with
colectomy, analysis of VEO-IBD-associated genes, revealed a causative mutation in
XIAP. The genetic diagnosis of a primary immune deficiency allowed curing the boy
with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
CONCLUSION: Our report, together with novel findings from recent literature,
should contribute to increase awareness of monogenic immune defects as a cause of
VEO-IBD. Comprehensive genetic analysis can allow a prompt diagnosis, resulting
in the choice of effective treatments and sparing useless and damaging
procedures.

Probiotics and commensal intestinal microbes suppress mammalian cytokine
production and intestinal inflammation in various experimental model systems.
Limited information exists regarding potential mechanisms of probiotic-mediated
immunomodulation in vivo. In this report, we demonstrate that specific probiotic 
strains of Lactobacillus reuteri suppress intestinal inflammation in a
trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced mouse colitis model. Only strains
that possess the hdc gene cluster, including the histidine decarboxylase and
histidine-histamine antiporter genes, can suppress colitis and mucosal cytokine
(interleukin-6 [IL-6] and IL-1β in the colon) gene expression. Suppression of
acute colitis in mice was documented by diminished weight loss, colonic injury,
serum amyloid A (SAA) protein concentrations, and reduced uptake of
[(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([(18)F]FDG) in the colon by positron emission
tomography (PET). The ability of probiotic L. reuteri to suppress colitis depends
on the presence of a bacterial histidine decarboxylase gene(s) in the intestinal 
microbiome, consumption of a histidine-containing diet, and signaling via the
histamine H2 receptor (H2R). Collectively, luminal conversion of l-histidine to
histamine by hdc(+) L. reuteri activates H2R, and H2R signaling results in
suppression of acute inflammation within the mouse colon.IMPORTANCE: Probiotics
are microorganisms that when administered in adequate amounts confer beneficial
effects on the host. Supplementation with probiotic strains was shown to suppress
intestinal inflammation in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and in rodent
colitis models. However, the mechanisms of probiosis are not clear. Our current
studies suggest that supplementation with hdc(+) L. reuteri, which can convert
l-histidine to histamine in the gut, resulted in suppression of colonic
inflammation. These findings link luminal conversion of dietary components (amino
acid metabolism) by gut microbes and probiotic-mediated suppression of colonic
inflammation. The effective combination of diet, gut bacteria, and host
receptor-mediated signaling may result in opportunities for therapeutic
microbiology and provide clues for discovery and development of next-generation
probiotics.

The aim of this study was to determine whether a functional human leukocyte
antigen-G (HLA-G) 14-bp insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism is associated
with susceptibility to autoimmune diseases. A meta-analysis was conducted to
assess the association between an HLA-G 14-bp I/D polymorphism and autoimmune
diseases using 1) allele contrast, as well as 2) recessive, 3) dominant, and 4)
codominant models. Sixteen articles that included 20 comparative studies with
3,555 patients and 5,225 controls were included in the meta-analysis. These
studies were performed on nine Caucasian, six South American, three Asian, one
Arab, and one African population samples. Our meta-analysis revealed no
association between autoimmune diseases and the HLA-G 14-bp I/D polymorphism
[odds ratio (OR) for allele I = 1.055; 95% confidence interval (CI) =
0.963-1.156; p = 0.251)]. However, meta-analysis according to autoimmune disease 
type revealed an association between systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and the
II+ID genotype of the HLA-G 14-bp I/D polymorphism (OR = 1.205; 95% CI =
1.036-1.403; p = 0.016). Furthermore, analysis using a codominant model revealed 
an association between this polymorphism and SLE (OR for ID vs. DD = 1.203; 95%
CI = 1.024-1.413; p = 0.024). In contrast, our meta-analysis revealed no
association between rheumatoid arthritis (RA), multiple sclerosis (MS), or
Crohn's disease (CD) and the HLA-G 14-bp I/D polymorphism. This meta-analysis
showed that the HLA-G 14-bp I/D polymorphism is associated with susceptibility to
a subgroup of autoimmune diseases such as SLE, but not RA, MS, or CD. These
results support the existence of an association between the HLA-G gene and a
subgroup of autoimmune diseases.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of inflammatory bowel disease with
polymorphisms and haplotypes of Fucosyltransferase 3 (FUT3) gene.
METHODS: A total of 389 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), 274 patients with 
Crohn's disease (CD), and 492 controls were collected. Three single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) of the FUT3 gene (rs28362459, rs3745635 and rs3894326) were 
determined by direct sequencing. Linkage disequilibrium and haplotype analysis
were performed using a Haploview 4.2 software.
RESULTS: Compared with the controls, the allele and genotype distributions of
FUT3 gene did not significantly differ between the UC and CD groups (all P>0.05).
By stratified analysis, the mutant allele (A) and genotype (GA+AA) of the FUT3
gene (rs3745635) were significantly increased in the UC group with distal colitis
compared with the controls (P<0.01, P<0.05, respectively). The mutant allele (G) 
and genotype (TG+GG) of the FUT3 gene (rs28362459) as well as the mutant allele
(A) of FUT3(rs3745635) were significantly increased in patients with ileocolonic 
CD and ileal CD as compared with the controls (P<0.05, P<0.01, P<0.05,
respectively). The frequency of mutant allele (G) of FUT3(rs28362459) was higher 
in stricturing CD patients than in the controls (P<0.05). In addition, the three 
polymorphic loci of FUT3 gene were shown in complete linkage disequilibrium
[rs3894326/rs3745635 (D'=1.0, r2=0.017), rs3894326/rs28362459 (D'=0.937,
r2=0.311), rs3745635/rs28362459 (D'=0.944, r2=0.448)]. However, the frequency of 
each haplotype was not significantly different between the UC and CD groups
compared with the controls (all P>0.05).
CONCLUSION: FUT3 (rs3745635) mutation may increase the risk of distal colitis.
FUT3 (rs28362459 and rs3745635) mutations may engender the increased risk of
ileocolonic and ileal CD. Moreover, FUT3 (rs28362459) polymorphism may influence 
the incidence of stricturing CD.

BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile infection is a major cause of nosocomial
diarrhoea.
AIM: To evaluate long-term (≥90 days) efficacy and safety of faecal microbiota
transplantation for C. difficile infection and explore the factors affecting the 
faecal microbiota transplantation outcomes.
METHODS: MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library and EMBASE were searched and only
observational studies that utilised faecal microbiota transplantation for C.
difficile infection with long-term follow-up duration (≥90 days) were included.
Primary cure rate, overall recurrence rate and early (<90 days) and late (≥90
days) recurrence rate were calculated.
RESULTS: Eighteen observational studies with 611 patients were included. The
primary cure rate was 91.2% (95% confidence interval, CI 86.7-94.8%). The overall
recurrence rate was 5.5% (95% CI 2.2-10.3%). The early recurrence rate and late
recurrence rate were 2.7% (95% CI 0.7-6.0%) and 1.7% (95% CI 0.4-4.2%)
respectively. Most adverse events were expected, short-lived, self-limited and
manageable. The association between faecal microbiota transplantation therapy and
adverse events such as inflammatory bowel disease flare, infectious disease and
autoimmune disease was a concern but remained insignificant. Old age (≥65 years) 
was identified as a risk factor for after faecal microbiota transplantation
therapy. Upper gastrointestinal administration also results in less frequent
primary cure.
CONCLUSIONS: Faecal microbiota transplantation seems to be a highly effective and
robust therapy for recurrent C. difficile infection. However, more quality
studies, such as randomised controlled trials and cohort studies with control
groups, are needed to confirm its long-term efficacy and safety.

BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis and
Crohn's disease, is a chronic inflammatory disease in the lower gastrointestinal 
tract. Mounting evidence suggests that the predominance of the classically
activated (M1) macrophages versus the alternatively activated (M2) macrophages
plays a role in the progression of IBD. Thus, agents able to shift
pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages to anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages may be
beneficial to IBD. The pentacyclic triterpene Lup-20(29)-en-3β-ol (Lupeol), a
potent anti-inflammatory natural product, has been shown to inhibit
pro-inflammatory cytokine production, suggesting it is potentially able to
modulate macrophage polarization, thereby beneficial to IBD.
METHODS: CD4(+) monocytes were differentiated to M1 or M2 macrophages, which were
cocultured with epithelial cell lines, T84 and Caco-2, in the absence or presence
of Lupeol (10μM). Experimental colitis was induced with dextran sodium sulfate
(DSS), with or without oral administration of Lupeol (50mg/kg, q.d.). Cytokines
were measured with Luminex kits. M1/M2 genes were measured with real-time
polymerase chain reaction. Macrophage phenotypes were defined by measuring M1 and
M2 markers with confocal microscopy. Proteins were measured with Western
blotting, while cell surface markers were measured with confocal microscopy or
flow cytometry. Histology was evaluated with H&E staining.
RESULTS: Treatment of M1 macrophages with Lupeol resulted in a marked decrease in
the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-12, IL6, IL-1β and
TNFα, and a marked increase in the production of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory
cytokine. This was associated with a down-regulation of CD86, a typical marker of
M1 macrophages, and an up-regulation of CD206, a typical M2 macrophage marker.
IRF5, a transcription factor that is critically involved in M1 polarization, was 
down-regulated in M1 macrophages after being incubated with Lupeol, associated
with a marked decrease in the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen activated protein
kinase. Coculture of epithelial cells with M1 macrophages resulted in
down-regulation of the tight junction protein ZO-1 and disruption of epithelial
integrity, which were blocked by Lupeol treatment of the M1 macrophages.
Moreover, oral administration of Lupeol to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced
colitis mice resulted in mitigated intestinal inflammation and increased survival
from lethal colitis, associated with decreased expression of M1-related genes and
increased expression of M2-related genes.
CONCLUSION: Lupeol ameliorates experimental inflammatory bowel disease through,
at least in part, inhibiting M1 and promoting M2 macrophages.

OBJECTIVE: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) including ulcerative colitis (UC)
and Crohn's disease (CD) increased the risk for developing colorectal cancer.
However, there is no effective therapy for IBDs. The aim of this study was to
identify potential therapeutic targets for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and
explore the possible mechanism underlying this disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gene expression profile GSE6731 was downloaded from Gene
Expression Omnibus database, which included 9 UC samples and 19 CD samples.
Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between affected colon tissues and
non-affected tissues were identified in UC and CD group. Then, Gene Ontology (GO)
and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways analysis of DEGs were
performed. Modules in the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were
identified, and significant node genes were selected.
RESULTS: Total 619 DEGs including 285 up-regulated genes and 334 down-regulated
genes were identified in UC group and total 1159 DEGs of CD including 585
up-regulated genes and 574 down-regulated genes were selected. Module was
selected from PPI network. From the PPI network and module, DEGs of
mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 (MAPK3), N-myc downstream regulated 1 (NDRG1) 
and major histocompatibility complex, class II, DR alpha (HLA-DRA) have high
degree.
CONCLUSIONS: MAPK3, NDRG1 and HLA-DRA may play key roles in the progression and
development of IBD. They may be used as specific therapeutic targets in the
treatment of IBD. However, further experiments are still needed to confirm our
results.

Crohn's disease (CD) is a systemic chronic inflammatory condition mainly
characterized by discontinuous transmural pathology of the gastrointestinal tract
and frequent extraintestinal manifestations with intermittent episodes of
remission and relapse. Genome-wide association studies identified a number of
risk loci that, catalyzed by environmental triggers, result in the loss of
tolerance toward commensal bacteria based on dysregulated innate effector
functions and antimicrobial defense, leading to exacerbated adaptive immune
responses responsible for chronic immune-mediated tissue damage. In this review, 
we discuss the inter-related role of changes in the intestinal microbiota,
epithelial barrier integrity, and immune cell functions on the pathogenesis of
CD, describing the current approaches available to investigate the molecular
mechanisms underlying the disease. Substantial effort has been dedicated to
define disease-associated changes in the intestinal microbiota (dysbiosis) and to
link pathobionts to the etiology of inflammatory bowel diseases. A cogent
definition of dysbiosis is lacking, as well as an agreement of whether
pathobionts or complex shifts in the microbiota trigger inflammation in the host.
Among the rarely available animal models, SAMP/Yit and TNF(deltaARE) mice are the
best known displaying a transmural CD-like phenotype. New hypothesis-driven mouse
models, e.g., epithelial-specific Caspase8(-/-), ATG16L1(-/-), and XBP1(-/-)
mice, validate pathway-focused function of specific CD-associated risk genes
highlighting the role of Paneth cells in antimicrobial defense. To study the
causal role of bacteria in initiating inflammation in the host, the use of
germ-free mouse models is indispensable. Unraveling the interactions of genes,
immune cells and microbes constitute a criterion for the development of safe,
reliable, and effective treatment options for CD.

We investigated the associations between 2 major tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) 
polymorphisms, rs1799724 C>T and rs1800629 G>A, and the susceptibility to Crohn's
disease (CD) using a meta-analysis framework. The PubMed, EBSCO, Ovid, Wiley, Web
of Science, WANFANG, and VIP databases (last updated search in October 2014) were
comprehensively searched for relevant published studies. The studies retrieved
from database searches were filtered based on inclusion and exclusion criteria,
and the resultant data extracted from the selected studies were analyzed using
the Comprehensive Meta-analysis 2.0 software. Eleven case-control studies,
containing 2000 CD patients and 3499 healthy controls, were identified as
relevant to this meta-analysis. Data extracted from these 11 studies were
analyzed to understand the role of the 2 TNF-α polymorphisms in CD. We found that
the TNF-α rs1799724 C>T polymorphism increased the susceptibility to CD (allele
model: OR = 1.293, 95%CI = 1.090-1.534, P = 0.003; dominant model: OR = 1.258,
95%CI = 1.031-1.534, P = 0.024). In contrast, we found no significant association
between the TNF-α rs1800629 G>A polymorphism and CD susceptibility (allele model:
OR = 1.005, 95%CI = 0.864-1.170, P = 0.945; dominant model: OR = 0.962, 95%CI =
0.809-1.145, P = 0.667). This meta-analysis showed that the TNF-α rs1799724 C>T
polymorphism is associated with CD susceptibility, while the TNF-α rs1800629 G>A 
polymorphism appeared to have no correlation with the susceptibility to CD.

Despite significant improvements in our understanding of Crohn's disease (CD) and
ulcerative colitis (UC) in recent years, questions remain regarding the best
approaches to assessment and management of these chronic diseases during periods 
of both relapse and remission. Various serologic biomarkers have been used in the
evaluation of patients with both suspected and documented inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD), and while each has potential utility in the assessment of patients
with IBD, potential limitation remain with each method of assessment. Given these
potential shortcomings, there has been increased interest in other means of
evaluation of patients with IBD, including an expanding interest in the role of
gene expression profiling. Among patients with IBD, gene expression profiles
obtained from whole blood have been used to differentiate active from inactive
CD, as well as to differentiate between CD, UC, and non-inflammatory diarrheal
conditions. There are many opportunities for a non-invasive, blood based test to 
aid in the assessment of patients with IBD, particularly when considering more
invasive means of evaluation including endoscopy with biopsy. Furthermore, as the
emphasis on personalized medicine continues to increase, the potential ability of
gene expression analysis to predict patient response to individual therapies
offers great promise. While whole blood gene expression analysis may not
completely replace more traditional means of evaluating patients with suspected
or known IBD, it does offer significant potential to expand our knowledge of the 
underlying genes involved in the development of these diseases.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether common variants in
inflammatory and immune response genes influence inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
risk among Moroccan patients. Using a candidate gene approach, 10
single-nucleotide polymorphisms mapping on six genes (MIF_rs755622,
TNFA_rs1800629, IL6_rs2069840, IL6R_rs2228145, IL6ST_rs2228044, IL17A (rs2275913,
rs4711998, rs7747909, rs8193036, rs3819024)) were assessed in 510 subjects
grouped in 199 IBD and 311 healthy controls. Genotyping was performed with the
TaqMan allelic discrimination technology. The results were analyzed using PLINK
software. The frequency of allele A for TNFA rs1800629 was significantly higher
in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients compared with controls (30.16 vs 16.72%;
P=0.0005; odds ratio (OR)=2.15; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.39-3.32).
Statistically significant association to UC was also found under dominant AA+AG
vs GG (OR=1.85, 95% CI=1.07-3.21; P=0.02) and recessive models (OR=8.38; 95%
CI=2.86-24.53; P=0.0001). In the same way, an association of TNFA rs1800629
variant was observed with IBD under recessive model AA vs AG+GG (OR=4.10; 95%
CI=1.56-10.76; P=0.004). No evidence of significant associations was found for
the remaining investigated polymorphisms. Our data suggest that TNFA gene
promoter polymorphism participates in determining IBD susceptibility in Moroccan 
patients.

PURPOSE: The -1237T/C polymorphism of the Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) gene has
been implicated in the susceptibility of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), but 
the results remain conflicting. We further investigated this association via
meta-analysis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multiple electronic databases were extensively searched
until February, 2015. The strength of association was evaluated by calculating
the pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: A total of 2987 cases and 2388 controls from eight studies were
analyzed. Overall, association was found between TLR9 -1237T/C polymorphism and
the risk of IBDs when all the studies were pooled (recessive model, OR: 1.59, 95%
CI: 1.02-2.47, p=0.04; homozygote comparison, OR: 1.62, 95% CI: 1.04-2.52,
p=0.03; allele model, OR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.00-1.27, p=0.05). Stratification by
ethnicity indicated an association between TLR9 -1237T/C polymorphism and IBDs
risk in Caucasians (recessive model, OR: 1.59, 95% CI: 1.02-2.47, p=0.04;
homozygote comparison, OR: 1.62, 95% CI: 1.04-2.52, p=0.03; allele model, OR:
1.12, 95% CI: 1.00-1.27, p=0.05). When stratified by disease type, significant
correlation were only found in the Crohn's disease subgroup (recessive model, OR:
1.69, 95% CI: 1.05-2.73, p=0.03; homozygote model, OR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.07-2.82,
p=0.02; allele model, OR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.01-1.32, p=0.04).
CONCLUSION: The present study suggested that the TLR9 -1237T/C polymorphism might
act as a risk factor in the development of IBDs, particularly in Caucasians.

The intestinal immune system is tailored to fight pathogens effectively while
tolerating the indigenous microbiota. Impairments of this homeostatic interaction
may contribute to the etiology of various diseases including inflammatory bowel
diseases. However, the molecular architecture underlying this complex regulatory 
interaction is not well understood. Here, we show that the fruit fly Drosophila
melanogaster has a multilayered intestinal immune system that ensures strictly
localized antimicrobial responses. Enterocytes, a major cell population of the
intestine, produced antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in a FoxO- but not
NF-κB-dependent manner. Consequently, animals impaired in FoxO-mediated signaling
had a significantly lowered resistance to intestinal infections; they were unable
to increase the expression of AMP genes and males showed an increased bacterial
load in response to an infection. Conventional innate immune signaling converging
onto NF-κB activation was operative in only a few regions of the intestine,
comprising the proventriculus, copper cells, and intestinal stem cells. Taken
together, our results imply that danger-mediated as well as conventional innate
immune signaling constitute modules that contribute to the fruit fly's intestinal
immune system. We propose that this special architecture ensures localized and
efficient antimicrobial responses against invasive pathogens while preserving the
microbiota.

BACKGROUND: Gut microbiota dysbiosis contributes to the pathogenesis of
inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Although the microbiota's role in IBD
pathogenesis, specifically Crohn's disease (CD), provides a rationale for
antibiotic treatment, antibiotic use in CD remains controversial. Rifaximin,
traditionally identified as a nonsystemic bactericidal antibiotic, may be
therapeutically beneficial for inducing CD remission.
AIM: To examine the role of rifaximin in the management of IBD and its potential 
mechanisms of action.
METHODS: A literature search using the following strategy: ('inflammatory bowel
disease' OR 'Crohn's' OR 'ulcerative'), 'rifaximin' AND ('barrier' OR
'translocation' OR 'adhesion' OR 'internalization' OR 'pregnane X'), AND
'pregnane X' AND ('Crohn's' OR 'ulcerative colitis' OR 'inflammatory bowel
disease').
RESULTS: In vitro data suggest rifaximin mediates changes in epithelial cell
physiology and reduces bacterial attachment and internalisation. In experimental 
colitis models, rifaximin antagonised the effects of tumour necrosis factor-α on 
intestinal epithelial cells by activating pregnane X receptor, which inhibits
nuclear factor-κB-mediated proinflammatory mediators and induces detoxification
genes (e.g. multidrug resistance 1 and cytochrome P450 3A4). Rifaximin also
inhibits bacterial translocation into the mesenteric lymph nodes.
CONCLUSION: Accumulating evidence suggests that mechanisms of action of rifaximin
in IBD may not be limited to direct bactericidal activity; therefore, rifaximin
could potentially be redefined as a gut environment modulator.

Since the first publication on "regional ileitis", the relevance of this chronic 
inflammatory disease condition termed finally as Crohn's disease is continuously 
increasing. Although we are beginning to comprehend certain aspects of its
pathogenesis, many facets remain unexplored. Host's gut microbiota is involved in
a wide range of physiological and pathological processes including immune system 
development, and pathogen regulation. Further, the microbiome is thought to play 
a key role in Crohn's disease. The presence of Crohn's-associated variants of
NOD2 and ATG16L genes appears to be associated not only with alterations of
mucosal barrier functions, and bacterial killing, but the gut microbiota, as
well, reflecting a potential relationship between the host's genotype and
intestinal dysbiosis, involved in disease etiology. This review aims to
characterize some exciting new aspect of Crohn's disease pathology, focusing
mainly on the role of intestinal microbes, and their interplay with the immune
system of the host.

BACKGROUND: A temporary stoma is often created to protect a distal anastomosis in
colorectal surgery. Short-chain fatty acids, mainly butyrate, are the major fuel 
source for the epithelium and their absence in the diverted tract may produce
mucosal atrophy and inflammation.
AIMS: To investigate whether the administration of sodium butyrate enemas
(Naburen(©), Promefarm, Italy) could prevent mucosal inflammation and atrophy and
affect gene expression profiles after ileo/colostomy.
METHODS: We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical
trial, in patients with enterostomy performed for inflammatory bowel disease,
colorectal cancer or diverticulitis. Twenty patients were randomly allocated to
receive 30ml of sodium butyrate 600mmol/L (group A) or saline (group B), b.i.d.
for 30 days.
RESULTS: In group A endoscopic scores were significantly improved (p<0.01) while 
mucosal atrophy was reduced or unchanged; in group B mucosal atrophy was
increased in 42.8% of patients. Despite the high dose of butyrate used, no
short-chain fatty acids were detectable by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
in colorectal biopsies. Group A patients showed up-regulation of genes associated
with mucosal repair such as Wnt signalling, cytoskeleton regulation and bone
morphogenetic protein-antagonists.
CONCLUSION: Butyrate enemas may prevent the atrophy of the diverted colon/rectum,
thus improving the recovery of tissue integrity.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of chronic multifactorial disorders. 
According to a recent study, the number of IBD association loci is increased to
201, of which 37 and 27 loci contribute specifically to the development of
Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis respectively. Some IBD associated genes
are involved in innate immunity, in the autophagy and in the inflammatory
response such as NOD2, ATG16L1 and IL23R, while other are implicated in immune
mediated disease (STAT3) and in susceptibility to mycobacterium infection
(IL12B). In case of early onset of IBD (VEO-IBD) within the 6(th) year of age,
the disease may be caused by mutations in genes responsible for severe monogenic 
disorders such as the primary immunodeficiency diseases. In this review we
discuss how these monogenic disorders through different immune mechanisms can
similarly be responsible of VEO-IBD phenotype. Moreover we would highlight how
the identification of pathogenic genes by Next Generation Sequencing technologies
can allow to obtain a rapid diagnosis and to apply specific therapies.

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are multifactorial disorders resulting from
environmental and genetic factors. Polymorphisms in MDR1 and GSTs genes might
explain individual differences in susceptibility to IBD. We carried out a
case-control study to examine the association of MDR1 (C1236T and C3435T), GSTT1,
and GSTM1 polymorphisms with the risk of IBD. Subjects were genotyped using
PCR-RFLP for MDR1 gene and multiplex PCR for GSTT1 and GSTM1. Meta-analysis was
performed to test the association of variant allele carriage with IBD risk. We
report that GSTT1 null genotype is significantly associated with the risk of CD
(OR: 2.5, CI: 1.2-5, P = 0.013) and UC (OR: 3.5, CI: 1.5-8.5, P = 0.004) and can 
influence Crohn's disease behavior. The interaction between GSTT1 and GSTM1 genes
showed that the combined null genotypes were associated with the risk of UC (OR: 
3.1, CI: 1.1-9, P = 0.049). Furthermore, when compared to combined 1236CC/CT
genotypes, the 1236TT genotype of MDR1 gene was associated with the risk of UC
(OR: 3.7, CI: 1.3-10.7, P = 0.03). Meta-analysis demonstrated significantly
higher frequencies of 3435T carriage in IBD patients. Our results show that GSTT1
null and MDR1 polymorphisms could play a role in susceptibility to IBD.

The complete repair of the mucosa constitutes a key goal in inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD) treatment. The Wnt signaling pathway mediates mucosal repair and M2
macrophages that coordinate efficient healing have been related to Wnt ligand
expression. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) mediates
M2 polarization in vitro and we hypothesize that a STAT6-dependent macrophage
phenotype mediates mucosal repair in acute murine colitis by activating the Wnt
signaling pathway. Our results reveal an impaired mucosal expression of M2
macrophage-associated genes and delayed wound healing in STAT6(-/-) mice treated 
with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS). These mice also exhibited
decreased mucosal expression of Wnt2b, Wnt7b, and Wnt10a, diminished protein
levels of nuclear β-catenin that is mainly located in crypts adjacent to damage, 
and reduced mRNA expression of two Wnt/β-catenin target molecules Lgr5 and c-Myc 
when compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Murine peritoneal macrophages treated
with interleukin-4 (IL-4) and polarized toward an M2a phenotype overexpressed
Wnt2b, Wnt7b, and Wnt10a in a STAT6-dependent manner. Administration of a Wnt
agonist as well as transfer of properly polarized M2a macrophages to STAT6(-/-)
mice activated the Wnt signaling pathway in the damaged mucosa and accelerated
wound healing. Our results demonstrate that a STAT6-dependent macrophage
phenotype promotes mucosal repair in TNBS-treated mice through activation of the 
Wnt signaling pathway.

BACKGROUND: The genetic component of Crohn's disease (CD) is well known, with 140
susceptibility loci identified so far. In addition to single nucleotide
polymorphisms typically studied in genome-wide scans, copy number variation is
responsible for a large proportion of human genetic variation.
METHODS: We performed a genome-wide search for copy number variants associated
with CD using array comparative genomic hybridization. One of the found regions
was validated independently through real-time PCR. Serum levels of the found gene
were measured in patients and control subjects.
RESULTS: We found copy number differences for the C4S and C4L gene variants of
complement component C4 in the central major histocompatibility complex region on
chromosome 6p21. Specifically, we saw that CD patients tend to have lower C4L and
higher C4S copies than control subjects (P = 5.00 × 10 and P = 9.11 × 10), which 
was independent of known associated classical HLA I and II alleles (P = 7.68 × 10
and P = 6.29 × 10). Although C4 serum levels were not different between patients 
and control subjects, the relationship between C4 copy number and serum level was
different for patients and control subjects with higher copy numbers leading to
higher serum concentrations in control subjects, compared with CD patients (P <
0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: C4 is part of the classical activation pathway of the complement
system, which is important for (auto)immunity. Low C4L or high C4S copy number,
and corresponding effects on C4 serum level, could lead to an exaggerated
response against infections, possibly leading to (auto)immune disease.

NLRP3 inflammasome is a key component of the inflammatory process and its
dysregulation contributes to IBD for its ability to induce IL-1β release.
Previously, we reported that a novel small molecular activator of Nrf2,
3-(2-oxo-2-phenylethylidene)-2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-pyrazino-[2,1-a]isoquinolin-4(
11bH)-one (compound 1) can prevent the development of colorectal adenomas in
AOM-DSS models. Here we further investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of
compound 1 in DSS-induced colitis in C57BL/6 and NLRP3(-/-) mice, and revealed
the possible modulation by compound 1 of NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated IL-1β
release from macrophages. In C57BL/6 mice, oral administration of compound 1
significantly attenuated DSS-induced colonic pathological damage, remarkably
inhibited inflammatory cells infiltration and decreased myeloperoxidase (MPO) and
IL-1β secretion in colons. In contrast, mice deficient for NLRP3 were less
sensitive to DSS-induced acute colitis, and compound 1 treatment exerted no
protective effect on DSS-induced intestinal inflammation in NLRP3(-/-) mice. The 
protective effect of compound 1 may be attributed to its inhibition of NLRP3
inflammasome and Nrf2 activation in colons. Furthermore, compound 1, as a small
molecular activator of Nrf2, significantly inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome
activation in both THP-1 derived macrophages and bone-marrow derived macrophages,
as indicated by reduced expression of NLRP3 and cleaved caspase-1, and lowered
IL-1β secretion. Finally, compound 1-induced NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition is
through blocking NLRP3 priming step and dependent on Nrf2 activation. Taken
together, our findings demonstrate that compound 1 might be a potential agent for
the treatment of IBD by targeting Nrf2 and NLRP3 inflammasome.

BACKGROUND: Children with very early-onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD), 
those diagnosed at less than 5 years of age, are a unique population. A subset of
these patients present with a distinct phenotype and more severe disease than
older children and adults. Host genetics is thought to play a more prominent role
in this young population, and monogenic defects in genes related to primary
immunodeficiencies are responsible for the disease in a small subset of patients 
with VEO-IBD.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a child who presented at 3 weeks of life with very
early-onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD). He had a complicated disease
course and remained unresponsive to medical and surgical therapy. The refractory 
nature of his disease, together with his young age of presentation, prompted
utilization of whole exome sequencing (WES) to detect an underlying monogenic
primary immunodeficiency and potentially target therapy to the identified defect.
Copy number variation analysis (CNV) was performed using the eXome-Hidden Markov 
Model. Whole exome sequencing revealed 1,380 nonsense and missense variants in
the patient. Plausible candidate variants were not detected following analysis of
filtered variants, therefore, we performed CNV analysis of the WES data, which
led us to identify a de novo whole gene deletion in XIAP.
CONCLUSION: This is the first reported whole gene deletion in XIAP, the causal
gene responsible for XLP2 (X-linked lymphoproliferative Disease 2). XLP2 is a
syndrome resulting in VEO-IBD and can increase susceptibility to hemophagocytic
lymphohistocytosis (HLH). This identification allowed the patient to be referred 
for bone marrow transplantation, potentially curative for his disease and
critical to prevent the catastrophic sequela of HLH. This illustrates the unique 
etiology of VEO-IBD, and the subsequent effects on therapeutic options. This
cohort requires careful and thorough evaluation for monogenic defects and primary
immunodeficiencies.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to identify certain genes related to response to infliximab 
(IFX) and biomarkers to predict the IFX effect for Japanese Crohn's disease (CD) 
patients by performing an association study of single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) in candidate genes in the interleukin- (IL-) 17 signaling pathway with
response to IFX after 1 year of treatment.
METHODS: A total of 103 patients were divided into two groups, responders and
nonresponders. Twenty-eight tag SNPs in 5 genes were genotyped. The frequencies
of alleles and genotypes of each SNP were compared between responders and
nonresponders in three different inheritance models. A genetic test was performed
using a combination of the associated SNPs as biomarkers.
RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that the four
variable factors, concomitant use of immunomodulators, penetrating disease, a G/G
genotype of rs766748 in IL-17F, and a C/C or C/A genotype of rs1883136 in
TRAF3IP2, independently contributed to response to IFX after 1 year of treatment.
Genetic test using the polymorphisms of these genes perfectly predicted the
responder and nonresponder CD patients with both concomitant use of
immunomodulators and penetrating disease.
CONCLUSION: IL17F and TRAF3IP2 are one of IFX-related genes, useful as biomarkers
of IFX response, and may be target molecules for new therapeutic drugs.

Colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CA-CRC) is the cause of death in 10%-15% of
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. CA-CRC results from the accumulation
of mutations in intestinal epithelial cells and progresses through a
well-characterized inflammation to dysplasia to carcinoma sequence. Quantitative 
estimates of overall CA-CRC risks are highly variable ranging from 2% to 40%
depending on IBD severity, duration and location, with IBD duration being the
most significant risk factor associated with CA-CRC development. Recently,
studies have identified IBD patients with similar patterns of colonic
inflammation, but that differ with respect to CA-CRC development, suggesting a
role for additional non-inflammatory risk factors in CA-CRC development. One
suggestion is that select IBD patients carry polymorphisms in various low
penetrance disease susceptibility genes, which pre-dispose them to CA-CRC
development, although these loci have proven difficult to identify in human
genome-wide association studies. Mouse models of CA-CRC have provided a viable
alternative for the discovery, validation and study of individual genes in CA-CRC
pathology. In this review, we summarize the current CA-CRC literature with a
strong focus on genetic pre-disposition and highlight an emerging role for mouse 
models in the search for CA-CRC risk alleles.

BACKGROUND: The risk of urinary tract cancers, including kidney and bladder
cancers, was increased in transplant recipients receiving thiopurines.
AIM: To assess the risk of urinary tract cancers in patients with inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD) receiving thiopurines in the CESAME observational cohort.
METHODS: Between May 2004 and June 2005, 19 486 patients with IBD, 30.1% of whom 
were receiving thiopurines, were enrolled. Median follow-up was 35 months (IQR:
29-40).
RESULTS: Ten and six patients developed respectively kidney and bladder cancer.
The incidence rates of urinary tract cancer were 0.48/1000 patient-years in
patients receiving thiopurines (95% CI: 0.21-0.95), 0.10/1000 patient-years in
patients who discontinued thiopurines (95% CI: 0.00-0.56) and 0.30/1000
patient-years in patients never treated with thiopurines (95% CI: 0.12-0.62) at
entry. The standardised incidence ratio of urinary tract cancer was 3.40 (95% CI:
1.47-6.71, P = 0.006) in patients receiving thiopurines, 0.64 (95% CI: 0.01-3.56,
P = 0.92) in patients previously exposed to thiopurines and 1.17 (95% CI:
0.47-12.42, P = 0.78) in patients never treated with thiopurines. The
multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of urinary tract cancer between patients 
receiving thiopurines and those not receiving thiopurines was 2.82 (95% CI:
1.04-7.68, P = 0.04). Other significant risk factors were male gender (HR: 3.98, 
95% CI: 1.12-14.10, P = 0.03) and increasing age (HR after 65 years (ref <50):
13.26, 95% CI: 3.52-50.03, P = 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Patients with IBD receiving thiopurines have an increased risk of
urinary tract cancers. Clinically relevant excess risk is observed in older men.

The association of HLA class II genes with ulcerative colitis (UC) as an
autoimmune disease has been investigated for several years. However, factors
responsible for genetic predisposition of this disease have so far not been
clearly understood. In this study, for the first time, we aimed to investigate
the association between HLA-DRB1 types and UC in the population of Kerman, a city
southeast Iran. HLA typing was performed among 85 UC patients and 95 healthy
controls using PCR amplification, employing sequence specific primers (PCR-SSP). 
The DRB1 frequencies were determined in the patients and controls. HLA-DRB1*04
was negatively associated with UC. Furthermore, HLA-DRB1*13 was significantly
associated with severity of the disease (p=0.01) among UC patients. This is the
novel result that describes an association of HLA-DRB1*13 with UC and also shows 
the protective role of HLA-DRB1*04 against the disease in people of Kerman.

We aimed to analyze the possible association of KIR/HLA-C genotypes with the
susceptibility to Crohn's disease (CD) in a Spanish population. A total of 125
patients with CD and 339 healthy controls were selected for this study. KIR and
HLA-C typing were developed by sequence-specific oligonucleotide probing. We
found that the centromeric A/A genotype and HLA-C1 combination was significantly 
increased in CD patients (P<10(-3)). The KIR2DL3/2DL3 genotype was significantly 
increased in CD patients (P<0.0005). Moreover, we also observed a highly
significant increase of KIR2DL3-HLA-C1 homozygosis in CD patients (P<0.0005). Our
results confirm the relevance of the KIR2DL2/KIR2DL3 genes and their interaction 
with HLA-C to CD. We show that the contribution of the KIR genes to CD
susceptibility extends beyond the association with individual KIRs, with an
imbalance between activating and inhibitory KIR genes seeming to influence the
susceptibility to CD.

Using a meta-analysis framework, we investigated the association between the
NLRP3 rs35829419 polymorphism and increased susceptibility to diverse diseases in
humans. Relevant published studies were identified through a comprehensive and
systematic electronic search, using the following scientific literature
databases: Science Citation Index, the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, 
Current Contents Index, Chinese Biomedical, the Chinese Journal Full-Text, and
the Weipu Journal. Statistical analysis of data extracted from the selected high 
quality studies was performed using the Version 12.0 STATA software. A total of
13 case-control studies met our stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria for
the present meta-analysis. These 13 high quality studies contained relevant
information on 7719 patients with various diseases and 7094 healthy controls. Our
meta-analysis results showed that the NLRP3 gene rs35829419 C>A polymorphism was 
associated with a significantly increased risk of developing multiple diseases in
humans under 5 genetic models (all P < 0.05). Data stratification and subgroup
analysis based on the disease type revealed that rs35829419 C>A carriers
displayed a markedly increase susceptibility to leprosy, colorectal cancer, HIV-1
infection, rheumatoid arthritis, abdominal aortic aneurysms, inflammatory bowel
disease, ulcerative colitis, and atopic dermatitis. In summary, our meta-analysis
results revealed the first identified strong correlation between the NLRP3
rs35829419 polymorphism and increased susceptibility to various diseases in
humans.

The spondyloarthropathies comprise ankylosing spondylitis (AS), reactive
arthritis, psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and arthritis associated with inflammatory
bowel disease. In this Perspectives article, we describe how Behçet disease and
several clinically distinct spondyloarthropathies-all associated with MHC class I
(MHC-I) alleles such as HLA-B(*)51, HLA-C(*)0602 and HLA-B(*)27 and epistatic
ERAP-1 interactions-have a shared immunopathogenetic basis. As a unifying
concept, we propose that barrier dysfunction in environmentally exposed organs
such as the skin, and aberrant innate immune reactions at sites of mechanical
stress, can often trigger secondary adaptive immune CD8(+) T-cell responses with 
prominent neutrophilic inflammation that culminate in exacerbation and recurrence
of these diseases. Of note, these 'MHC-I-opathies' show a differential
immunopathology, probably reflecting antigenic differences within target tissues:
HLA-B(*)51 is linked to ocular and mucocutaneous disease but not gut involvement,
and HLA-C(*)0602 is linked to type I psoriasis but not scalp or nail disease.

OBJECTIVES: Exploring associations between the gut microbiota and colonic
inflammation and assessing sequential changes during exclusive enteral nutrition 
(EEN) may offer clues into the microbial origins of Crohn's disease (CD).
METHODS: Fecal samples (n=117) were collected from 23 CD and 21 healthy children.
From CD children fecal samples were collected before, during EEN, and when
patients returned to their habitual diets. Microbiota composition and functional 
capacity were characterized using sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and shotgun
metagenomics.
RESULTS: Microbial diversity was lower in CD than controls before EEN (P=0.006); 
differences were observed in 36 genera, 141 operational taxonomic units (OTUs),
and 44 oligotypes. During EEN, the microbial diversity of CD children further
decreased, and the community structure became even more dissimilar than that of
controls. Every 10 days on EEN, 0.6 genus diversity equivalents were lost; 34
genera decreased and one increased during EEN. Fecal calprotectin correlated with
35 OTUs, 14 of which accounted for 78% of its variation. OTUs that correlated
positively or negatively with calprotectin decreased during EEN. The microbiota
of CD patients had a broader functional capacity than healthy controls, but
diversity decreased with EEN. Genes involved in membrane transport, sulfur
reduction, and nutrient biosynthesis differed between patients and controls. The 
abundance of genes involved in biotin (P=0.005) and thiamine biosynthesis
decreased (P=0.017), whereas those involved in spermidine/putrescine biosynthesis
(P=0.031), or the shikimate pathway (P=0.058), increased during EEN.
CONCLUSIONS: Disease improvement following treatment with EEN is associated with 
extensive modulation of the gut microbiome.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Etrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against the β7 
integrin subunit that has shown efficacy vs placebo in patients with moderate to 
severely active ulcerative colitis (UC). Patients with colon tissues that
expressed high levels of the integrin αE gene (ITGAE) appeared to have the best
response. We compared differences in colonic expression of ITGAE and other genes 
between patients who achieved clinical remission with etrolizumab vs those who
did.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of data collected from 110
patients with UC who participated in a phase 2 placebo-controlled trial of
etrolizumab, as well as from 21 patients with UC or without inflammatory bowel
disease (controls) enrolled in an observational study at a separate site. Colon
biopsies were collected from patients in both studies and analyzed by
immunohistochemistry and gene expression profiling. Mononuclear cells were
isolated and analyzed by flow cytometry. We identified biomarkers associated with
response to etrolizumab. In the placebo-controlled trial, clinical remission was 
defined as total Mayo Clinic Score ≤2, with no individual subscore >1, and
mucosal healing was defined as endoscopic score ≤1.
RESULTS: Colon tissues collected at baseline from patients who had a clinical
response to etrolizumab expressed higher levels of T-cell-associated genes than
patients who did not respond (P < .05). Colonic CD4(+) integrin αE(+) cells from 
patients with UC expressed higher levels of granzyme A messenger RNA (GZMA mRNA) 
than CD4(+) αE(-) cells (P < .0001); granzyme A and integrin αE protein were
detected in the same cells. Of patients receiving 100 mg etrolizumab, a higher
proportion of those with high levels of GZMA mRNA (41%) or ITGAE mRNA (38%) than 
those with low levels of GZMA (6%) or ITGAE mRNA (13%) achieved clinical
remission (P < .05) and mucosal healing (41% GZMA(high) vs 19% GZMA(low) and 44% 
ITGAE(high) vs 19% ITGAE(low)). Compared with ITGAE(low) and GZMA(low) patients, 
patients with ITGAE(high) and GZMA(high) had higher baseline numbers of
epithelial crypt-associated integrin αE(+) cells (P < .01 for both), but a
smaller number of crypt-associated integrin αE(+) cells after etrolizumab
treatment (P < .05 for both). After 10 weeks of etrolizumab treatment, expression
of genes associated with T-cell activation and genes encoding inflammatory
cytokines decreased by 40%-80% from baseline (P < .05) in patients with colon
tissues expressing high levels of GZMA at baseline.
CONCLUSIONS: Levels of GZMA and ITGAE mRNAs in colon tissues can identify
patients with UC who are most likely to benefit from etrolizumab; expression

OBJECTIVE: Genome-wide association studies have identified single nucleotide
polymorphisms in genes that might influence intestinal barrier function (HNF4A,
ECM1, CDH1 and LAMB1) to increase the risk for ulcerative colitis (UC). The aim
of our study was to detect causative sequence alterations and provide a
functional link to a disturbed intestinal permeability (IP) in UC.
METHODS: A total of 19 UC patients with increased IP (lactulose/mannitol ratio
measured by sugar drink test) were identified from a large database, and
exon/intron boundaries, coding and promoter regions of HNF4A, ECM1, CDH1 and
LAMB1 were sequenced. Variants with putative protein alterations were studied for
an association with IP in 82 UC patients. A case-control analysis including a
genotype phenotype correlation was performed in 743 patients with inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD) and 473 healthy controls.
RESULTS: In UC patients, we identified 11 missense-mutations, 12 synonymous
mutations, one putative promoter variant and three variants in introns close to
the intron/exon boundaries (CDH1, HNF4A). For several variants prediction tools
revealed damaging protein alterations. None of the studied variants, however,
showed an association with an increased IP in UC. In the case-control analysis,
the frequency of all investigated variants did not differ between UC or Crohn's
disease and healthy controls. Furthermore, no significant association was found
to a distinct phenotype.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite our large sequencing approach, we could not identify protein
altering variants in the genes HNF4A, ECM1, CDH1 and LAMB1 which could explain an
impaired intestinal barrier function in UC. The functional relevance of these
genes in IBD remains unknown.

Inborn errors of the intestinal epithelial barrier function as well as the innate
and adaptive mucosal immune responses toward the intestinal microbiota are a
group of genetic disorders that confer susceptibility to monogenic and syndromal 
forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). There is a continuous spectrum of
genetic susceptibility from monogenic causative variants with complete Mendelian 
inheritance, over NOD2 variants with moderate penetrance to minute penetrance in 
most common susceptibility variants predisposing to conventional polygenic IBD.
We discuss advances to understand monogenic IBD and review recently identified
genetic defects. We describe an integrative model for genetic susceptibility
variants of conventional IBD and monogenic IBD-like intestinal inflammation in
the context of microbial commensal colonization and infection susceptibility.

BACKGROUND: Family history provides important information on risk of developing
inflammatory bowel disease [IBD], and genetic profiling of first-degree relatives
[FDR] of Crohn's disease [CD]- affected individuals might provide additional
information. We aimed to delineate the genetic contribution to the increased IBD 
susceptibility observed in FDR.
METHODS: N = 976 Caucasian, healthy, non-related FDR; n = 4997 independent CD;
and n = 5000 healthy controls [HC]; were studied. Genotyping for 158
IBD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs] was performed using the
Illumina Immunochip. Risk allele frequency [RAF] differences between FDR and HC
cohorts were correlated with those between CD and HC cohorts. CD and IBD genetic 
risk scores [GRS] were calculated and compared between HC, FDR, and CD cohorts.
RESULTS: IBD-associated SNP RAF differences in FDR and HC cohorts were strongly
correlated with those in CD and HC cohorts, correlation coefficient 0.63 (95%
confidence interval [CI] 0.53 - 0.72), p = 9.90 x 10(-19). There was a
significant increase in CD-GRS [mean] comparing HC, FDR, and CD cohorts: 0.0244, 
0.0250, and 0.0257 respectively [p < 1.00 x 10(-7) for each comparison]. There
was no significant difference in the IBD-GRS between HC and FDR cohorts [p =
0.81]; however, IBD-GRS was significantly higher in CD compared with FDR and HC
cohorts [p < 1.00 x 10(-10) for each comparison].
CONCLUSION: FDR of CD-affected individuals are enriched with IBD risk alleles
compared with HC. Cumulative CD-specific genetic risk is increased in FDR
compared with HC. Prospective studies are required to determine if genotyping
would facilitate better risk stratification of FDR.

BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are two major forms 
of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Meta-analyses of genome-wide association
studies (GWAS) have identified 163 susceptibility loci for IBD among European
populations; however, there is limited information for IBD susceptibility in a
Japanese population.
METHODS: We performed a GWAS using imputed genotypes of 743 IBD patients (372
with CD and 371 with UC) and 3321 controls. Using 100 tag single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) (P < 5 × 10(-5)), a replication study was conducted with an 
independent set of 1310 IBD patients (949 with CD and 361 with UC) and 4163
controls. In addition, 163 SNPs identified by a European IBD GWAS were genotyped,
and genetic backgrounds were compared between the Japanese and European
populations.
RESULTS: In the IBD GWAS, two East Asia-specific IBD susceptibility loci were
identified in the Japanese population: ATG16L2-FCHSD2 and SLC25A15-ELF1-WBP4.
Among 163 reported SNPs in European IBD patients, significant associations were
confirmed in 18 (8 CD-specific, 4 UC-specific, and 6 IBD-shared). In Japanese CD 
patients, genes in the Th17-IL23 pathway showed stronger genetic effects, whereas
the association of genes in the autophagy pathway was limited. The association of
genes in the epithelial barrier and the Th17-IL23R pathways were similar in the
Japanese and European UC populations.
CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed two IBD susceptibility loci as common for CD and UC,
and East Asian-specific. The genetic architecture in UC appeared to be similar
between Europeans and East Asians, but may have some differences in CD.

The recent identification of genetic mutations leading to dysfunction of
inflammatory and apoptotic pathways, has allowed to characterise a group of
diseases, recognised as monogenic autoinflammatory syndromes. Among those, Blau
syndrome (BS) and early-onset sarcoidosis (EOS) have been identified as familial 
and sporadic phenotypes of the same non-caseating granulomatous form. Both the
diseases are caused by mutations in the CARD15/NOD2 gene, encoding the cytosolic 
NOD2 protein, one of the key molecules in the regulation of innate immunity.
Clinical onset is typically located in the first years of life and phenotype is
characterised by simultaneous or less articular, cutaneous and ocular
non-caseating granulomatous inflammation, which can be variably associated with a
heterogeneous systemic spectrum. The CARD15/NOD2 gene has also been identified as
one of the genes linked to susceptibility to Crohn's disease (CD), a common
polygenic inflammatory granulomatous bowel disease. The heightened nuclear
factor-κB activity, found in the intestinal tissue of patients affected by CD,
has probably a genetic cause related to several CARD15/NOD2 polymorphisms. Other 
substitutions in the CARD15/NOD2 gene have also been found in a recently
described disorder, called NOD2-associated autoinflammatory disease, which shares
several clinical characteristics with BS and EOS. This review attempts to
describe these diseases on the basis of the most recent evidences. We described
genetic and clinical aspects, mainly focusing on BS and EOS, the most
representative diseases of autoinflammatory granulomatous diseases, with the
ultimate purpose to expand their knowledge.

MOTIVATION: Analysing the joint association between a large set of responses and 
predictors is a fundamental statistical task in integrative genomics, exemplified
by numerous expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) studies. Of particular
interest are the so-called ': hotspots ': , important genetic variants that
regulate the expression of many genes. Recently, attention has focussed on
whether eQTLs are common to several tissues, cell-types or, more generally,
conditions or whether they are specific to a particular condition.
RESULTS: We have implemented MT-HESS, a Bayesian hierarchical model that analyses
the association between a large set of predictors, e.g. SNPs, and many responses,
e.g. gene expression, in multiple tissues, cells or conditions. Our Bayesian
sparse regression algorithm goes beyond ': one-at-a-time ': association tests
between SNPs and responses and uses a fully multivariate model search across all 
linear combinations of SNPs, coupled with a model of the correlation between
condition/tissue-specific responses. In addition, we use a hierarchical structure
to leverage shared information across different genes, thus improving the
detection of hotspots. We show the increase of power resulting from our new
approach in an extensive simulation study. Our analysis of two case studies
highlights new hotspots that would remain undetected by standard approaches and
shows how greater prediction power can be achieved when several tissues are
jointly considered.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this study was to identify the profile of rare
variants associated with Crohn's disease (CD) using whole exome sequencing (WES) 
analysis of Korean children with CD and to evaluate whether genetic profiles
could provide information during medical decision making.
METHODS: DNA samples from 18 control individuals and 22 patients with infantile, 
very-early and early onset CD of severe phenotype were used for WES. Genes were
filtered using panels of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-associated genes and
genes of primary immunodeficiency (PID) and monogenic IBD.
RESULTS: Eighty-one IBD-associated variants and 35 variants in PID genes were
revealed by WES. The most frequently occurring variants were carried by nine
(41%) and four (18.2%) CD probands and were ATG16L2 (rs11235604) and IL17REL
(rs142430606), respectively. Twenty-four IBD-associated variants and 10 PID
variants were predicted to be deleterious and were identified in the heterozygous
state. However, their functions were unknown with the exception of a novel
p.Q111X variant in XIAP (X chromosome) of a male proband.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of many rare variants of unknown significance limits
the clinical applicability of WES for individual CD patients. However, WES in
children may be beneficial for distinguishing CD secondary to PID.

In Crohn's disease, one of the two major forms of inflammatory bowel diseases in 
human beings, persistent and chronic inflammation promotes fibrotic processes
thereby facilitating formation of strictures, the most common indication for
surgical intervention in this disorder. The pathogenesis of Crohn's
disease-associated fibrosis is not fully understood, but variants of genes
involved in the recognition of microbial components/products [e.g. CARD15
(caspase-activating recruitment domain 15) and ATG16L1 (autophagy-related 16-like
1)] are associated with this phenotype, and experimental evidence suggests that
intestinal fibrosis results from an altered balance between deposition of ECM
(extracellular matrix) and degradation of ECM by proteases. Studies have also
contributed to identify the main phenotypic and functional alterations of cells
involved in the fibrogenic process, as well as molecules that stimulate such
cells to produce elevated amounts of collagen and other ECM-related proteins. In 
the present review, we assess the current knowledge about cellular and molecular 
mediators of intestinal fibrosis and describe results of recent studies aimed at 
testing the preventive/therapeutic effect of compounds in experimental models of 
intestinal fibrosis.

BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are the two major forms of
inflammatory bowel disease; treatment strategies have historically been
determined by this binary categorisation. Genetic studies have identified 163
susceptibility loci for inflammatory bowel disease, mostly shared between Crohn's
disease and ulcerative colitis. We undertook the largest genotype association
study, to date, in widely used clinical subphenotypes of inflammatory bowel
disease with the goal of further understanding the biological relations between
diseases.
METHODS: This study included patients from 49 centres in 16 countries in Europe, 
North America, and Australasia. We applied the Montreal classification system of 
inflammatory bowel disease subphenotypes to 34,819 patients (19,713 with Crohn's 
disease, 14,683 with ulcerative colitis) genotyped on the Immunochip array. We
tested for genotype-phenotype associations across 156,154 genetic variants. We
generated genetic risk scores by combining information from all known
inflammatory bowel disease associations to summarise the total load of genetic
risk for a particular phenotype. We used these risk scores to test the hypothesis
that colonic Crohn's disease, ileal Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis are
all genetically distinct from each other, and to attempt to identify patients
with a mismatch between clinical diagnosis and genetic risk profile.
FINDINGS: After quality control, the primary analysis included 29,838 patients
(16,902 with Crohn's disease, 12,597 with ulcerative colitis). Three loci (NOD2, 
MHC, and MST1 3p21) were associated with subphenotypes of inflammatory bowel
disease, mainly disease location (essentially fixed over time; median follow-up
of 10·5 years). Little or no genetic association with disease behaviour (which
changed dramatically over time) remained after conditioning on disease location
and age at onset. The genetic risk score representing all known risk alleles for 
inflammatory bowel disease showed strong association with disease subphenotype
(p=1·65 × 10(-78)), even after exclusion of NOD2, MHC, and 3p21
(p=9·23 × 10(-18)). Predictive models based on the genetic risk score strongly
distinguished colonic from ileal Crohn's disease. Our genetic risk score could
also identify a small number of patients with discrepant genetic risk profiles
who were significantly more likely to have a revised diagnosis after follow-up
(p=6·8 × 10(-4)).
INTERPRETATION: Our data support a continuum of disorders within inflammatory
bowel disease, much better explained by three groups (ileal Crohn's disease,
colonic Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis) than by Crohn's disease and
ulcerative colitis as currently defined. Disease location is an intrinsic aspect 
of a patient's disease, in part genetically determined, and the major driver to
changes in disease behaviour over time.

CARD9 is a central component of anti-fungal innate immune signaling via C-type
lectin receptors, and several immune-related disorders are associated with CARD9 
alterations. Here, we used a rare CARD9 variant that confers protection against
inflammatory bowel disease as an entry point to investigating CARD9 regulation.
We showed that the protective variant of CARD9, which is C-terminally truncated, 
acted in a dominant-negative manner for CARD9-mediated cytokine production,
indicating an important role for the C terminus in CARD9 signaling. We identified
TRIM62 as a CARD9 binding partner and showed that TRIM62 facilitated K27-linked
poly-ubiquitination of CARD9. We identified K125 as the ubiquitinated residue on 
CARD9 and demonstrated that this ubiquitination was essential for CARD9 activity.
Furthermore, we showed that similar to Card9-deficient mice, Trim62-deficient
mice had increased susceptibility to fungal infection. In this study, we utilized
a rare protective allele to uncover a TRIM62-mediated mechanism for regulation of
CARD9 activation.

To investigate the biological foundation of the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),
ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, susceptibility locus rs2872507, we have
investigated the expression of 13 genes using ileal and colonic biopsies from
patients with IBD (inflamed and noninflamed mucosa) or from individuals without
IBD (noninflamed mucosa). The susceptibility allele was consistently associated
with reduced expression of GSDMB (P = 4.1 × 10(-3)-7.2 × 10(-10)). The
susceptibility allele was also associated with the increased expression of GSDMA 
(P = 1.6 × 10(-4)) and LRRC3C (P = 7.8 × 10(-6)) in colon tissue from individuals
without IBD and with the reduced expression of PGAP3 (IBD; P = 2.0 × 10(-3)) and 
ZPBP2 (Crohn's disease; P = 7.7 × 10(-4)) in noninflamed ileum. Inflammation
resulted in the reduced colonic expression of ERBB2, GRB7, MIEN1, and PGAP3 (P = 
1.0 × 10(-4)-1.0 × 10(-9)) and the increased colonic expression of IKZF3 and CSF3
(P = 2.4 × 10(-7)-3.5 × 10(-8)). Based on our results and published findings on
GSDMA, GSDMB, LRRC3C, and related proteins, we propose that this locus in part
affects IBD susceptibility via effects on apoptosis and cell proliferation and
believe this hypothesis warrants further experimental investigation.

BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is associated with differential expression of
genes involved in inflammation and tissue remodeling, including FOXO3a, which
encodes a transcription factor known to promote inflammation in several tissues. 
However, FOXO3a expression in tissues affected by UC has not been examined. This 
study investigated the effects of FOXO3a on UC pathogenesis.
METHODS: FOXO3a expression, in 23 patients with UC and in HT29 cells treated with
tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) for various durations, was detected by
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting analysis.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to quantify interleukin (IL)-8
expression in FOXO3a-silenced HT29 cells treated with TNF-α for various
durations.
RESULTS: The messenger RNA and protein expression of FOXO3a were significantly
lower in UC tissues than those in normal subjects (P < 0.01). TNF-α treatment for
0, 0.5, 1, 6, and 24 h induced FOXO3 degradation in HT29 cells. FOXO3a silencing 
increased IL-8 levels in HT29 cells treated with TNF-α for 6 h (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: FOXO3a may play an important role in the intestinal inflammation of
patients with UC.

The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) plays a crucial role in inflammatory responses. 
GR has several isoforms, of which the most deeply studied are the GRα and GRß.
Recently it has been suggested that in addition to its negative dominant effect
on GRα, the GRß may have a GRα-independent transcriptional activity. The GRß
isoform was found to be frequently overexpressed in various autoimmune diseases, 
including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In this study, we wished to test
whether the gene expression profile found in a GRß overexpressing intestinal cell
line (Caco-2GRß) might mimic the gene expression alterations found in patients
with IBD. Whole genome microarray analysis was performed in both normal and GRß
overexpressing Caco-2 cell lines with and without dexamethasone treatment.
IBD-related genes were identified from a meta-analysis of 245 microarrays
available in online microarray deposits performed on intestinal mucosa samples
from patients with IBD and healthy individuals. The differentially expressed
genes were further studied using in silico pathway analysis. Overexpression of
GRß altered a large proportion of genes that were not regulated by dexamethasone 
suggesting that GRß may have a GRα-independent role in the regulation of gene
expression. About 10% of genes differentially expressed in colonic mucosa samples
from IBD patients compared to normal subjects were also detected in Caco-2 GRß
intestinal cell line. Common genes are involved in cell adhesion and cell
proliferation. Overexpression of GRß in intestinal cells may affect appropriate
mucosal repair and intact barrier function. The proposed novel role of GRß in
intestinal epithelium warrants further studies.

Null mutations in genes involved in V(D)J recombination cause a block in B- and
T-cell development, clinically presenting as severe combined immunodeficiency
(SCID). Hypomorphic mutations in the non-homologous end-joining gene DCLRE1C
(encoding ARTEMIS) have been described to cause atypical SCID, Omenn syndrome,
Hyper IgM syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease-all with severely impaired
T-cell immunity. By whole-exome sequencing, we investigated the molecular defect 
in a consanguineous family with three children clinically diagnosed with antibody
deficiency. We identified perfectly segregating homozygous variants in DCLRE1C in
three index patients with recurrent respiratory tract infections, very low B-cell
numbers and serum IgA levels. In patients, decreased colony survival after
irradiation, impaired proliferative response and reduced counts of naïve T cells 
were observed in addition to a restricted T-cell receptor repertoire, increased
palindromic nucleotides in the complementarity determining regions 3 and long
stretches of microhomology at switch junctions. Defective V(D)J recombination was
complemented by wild-type ARTEMIS protein in vitro. Subsequently, homozygous or
compound heterozygous DCLRE1C mutations were identified in nine patients from the
same geographic region. We demonstrate that DCLRE1C mutations can cause a
phenotype presenting as only antibody deficiency. This novel association broadens
the clinical spectrum associated with ARTEMIS mutations. Clinicians should
consider the possibility that an immunodeficiency with a clinically mild initial 
presentation could be a combined immunodeficiency, so as to provide appropriate
care for affected patients.

The diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) still remains a clinical
challenge and the most accurate diagnostic procedure is a combination of clinical
tests including invasive endoscopy. In this study we evaluated whether systematic
miRNA expression profiling, in conjunction with machine learning techniques, is
suitable as a non-invasive test for the major IBD phenotypes (Crohn's disease
(CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)). Based on microarray technology, expression
levels of 863 miRNAs were determined for whole blood samples from 40 CD and 36 UC
patients and compared to data from 38 healthy controls (HC). To further
discriminate between disease-specific and general inflammation we included miRNA 
expression data from other inflammatory diseases (inflammation controls (IC): 24 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 23 multiple sclerosis, 38
pancreatitis and 45 sarcoidosis cases) as well as 70 healthy controls from
previous studies. Classification problems considering 2, 3 or 4 groups were
solved using different types of penalized support vector machines (SVMs). The
resulting models were assessed regarding sparsity and performance and a subset
was selected for further investigation. Measured by the area under the ROC curve 
(AUC) the corresponding median holdout-validated accuracy was estimated as
ranging from 0.75 to 1.00 (including IC) and 0.89 to 0.98 (excluding IC),
respectively. In combination, the corresponding models provide tools for the
distinction of CD and UC as well as CD, UC and HC with expected classification
error rates of 3.1 and 3.3%, respectively. These results were obtained by
incorporating not more than 16 distinct miRNAs. Validated target genes of these
miRNAs have been previously described as being related to IBD. For others we
observed significant enrichment for IBD susceptibility loci identified in earlier
GWAS. These results suggest that the proposed miRNA signature is of relevance for
the etiology of IBD. Its diagnostic value, however, should be further evaluated
in large, independent, clinically well characterized cohorts.

Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is one of the late complications observed in patients
suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Carcinogenesis is promoted by
persistent chronic inflammation occurring in IBD. Understanding the mechanisms
involved is essential in order to ameliorate inflammation and prevent CRC.
Thrombospondin 1 (TSP-1) is a multidomain glycoprotein with important roles in
angiogenesis. The effects of TSP-1 in colonic tumor formation and growth were
analyzed in a model of inflammation-induced carcinogenesis. WT and TSP-1
deficient mice (TSP-1-/-) of the C57BL/6 strain received a single injection of
azoxymethane (AOM) and multiple cycles of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) to induce 
chronic inflammation-related cancers. Proliferation and angiogenesis were
histologically analyzed in tumors. The intestinal transcriptome was also analyzed
using a gene microarray approach. When the area containing tumors was compared
with the entire colonic area of each mouse, the tumor burden was decreased in
AOM/DSS-treated TSP-1-/- versus wild type (WT) mice. However, these lesions
displayed more angiogenesis and proliferation rates when compared with the WT
tumors. AOM-DSS treatment of TSP-1-/- mice resulted in significant deregulation
of genes involved in transcription, canonical Wnt signaling, transport, defense
response, regulation of epithelial cell proliferation and metabolism. Microarray 
analyses of these tumors showed down-regulation of 18 microRNAs in TSP-1-/-
tumors. These results contribute new insights on the controversial role of TSP-1 
in cancer and offer a better understanding of the genetics and pathogenesis of
CRC.

BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is one of the most important cancers worldwide with a
high incident and mortality rate and is caused by the human papilloma virus
(HPV). Among sexually active women who get infected with human papillomavirus
(HPV), a small fraction progresses to cervical cancer disease pointing to
possible roles of additional risk factors in development of the disease which
include host genetic factors and other infections such as HSV-2. Since cellular
apoptosis plays a role in controlling the spread of virus-infections in cells,
gene variants altering the function of proteins involved in cell death pathways
might be associated with the clearing of virus infections. Activity altering
polymorphisms in FasR (-1377G > A and -670A > G), FasL (-844 T > C) and CASP8
(-652 6 N ins/del) genes have been shown to alter the mechanism of apoptosis by
modifying the level of expression of their correspondent proteins. In the present
study, we set out to investigate the combined risks of CASP8, FasR, and FasL
polymorphisms in cervical cancer, pre-cancerous lesions, HPV infection and HSV-2 
infection.
METHODS: Participants were 442 South African women of black African and
mixed-ancestry origin with invasive cervical cancer and 278 control women matched
by age, ethnicity and domicile status. FasR and FasL polymorphisms were genotyped
by TaqMan and CASP8 polymorphism by PCR-RFLP. The results were analysed with R
using haplo.stats software version 1.5.2.
RESULTS: CASP8 -652 6 N del + FasR-670A was associated with a reduced risk
(P = 0.019, Combined Polymorphism Score (CPS) = -2.34) and CASP8 -652 6 N
ins + FasR-1377G was associated with a marginal increased risk (P = 0.047,
CPS = 1.99) of cervical cancer among black Africans. When compared within the
control group, CASP8 -652 6 N ins + FasR-1377A showed a reduced risk (P = 0.023, 
CPS = -2.28) of HSV-2 infection in both black African and mixed-ancestry
population.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the combined risks of variants in cell death
pathway genes are associated with the cervical cancer as well as the HSV-2
infection in the black African and mixed-ancestry population.

Autoimmune diseases (AIDs) are polygenic diseases affecting 7-10% of the
population in the Western Hemisphere with few effective therapies. Here, we
quantify the heritability of paediatric AIDs (pAIDs), including JIA, SLE, CEL,
T1D, UC, CD, PS, SPA and CVID, attributable to common genomic variations
(SNP-h(2)). SNP-h(2) estimates are most significant for T1D (0.863±s.e. 0.07) and
JIA (0.727±s.e. 0.037), more modest for UC (0.386±s.e. 0.04) and CD
(0.454±0.025), largely consistent with population estimates and are generally
greater than that previously reported by adult GWAS. On pairwise analysis, we
observed that the diseases UC-CD (0.69±s.e. 0.07) and JIA-CVID (0.343±s.e. 0.13) 
are the most strongly correlated. Variations across the MHC strongly contribute
to SNP-h(2) in T1D and JIA, but does not significantly contribute to the pairwise
rG. Together, our results partition contributions of shared versus
disease-specific genomic variations to pAID heritability, identifying pAIDs with 
unexpected risk sharing, while recapitulating known associations between
autoimmune diseases previously reported in adult cohorts.

BACKGROUND: There has been considerable progress in identifying inflammatory
bowel disease [IBD] susceptibility genes but little progress in examining the
role of genetic variation in the development of the extra-intestinal
manifestations [EIMs] of IBD. This study identified clinical, serological, and
genetic factors associated with ocular EIMs [O-EIMs] in IBD.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective case-control study of IBD patients,
comparing those with and without O-EIMs using the Cedars-Sinai IBD Research
Repository and the NIDDK IBD Genetics Consortium Repository. Genotyping was
performed using Illumina whole genome platforms.
RESULTS: In all, 124 cases and 3328 controls with available clinical data were
identified; 103 cases and 2808 controls had genetic data available. Erythema
nodosum and peripheral arthritis particularly were common in patients with O-EIMs
[p = 2.77 x 10(-13) and p = 2.58 x 10(-13), respectively] with increasing odds
ratios for O-EIMs with each additional non-ocular-EIM [for ≥ 2 EIMs, odds ratio
14.72]. Nominal association with O-EIMs was observed at several known IBD
susceptibility single nuclear polymorphisms. One locus, containing RBM19,
achieved genome-wide level of significance for association with O-EIMs.
CONCLUSIONS: In IBD, O-EIMs co-occur with musculoskeletal and skin manifestations
and, in this study, are nominally associated with known IBD loci. Additional
cohorts are needed to verify these results and identify additional genes.

Hyaluronan (HA) overproduction is a hallmark of multiple inflammatory diseases,
including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Hyaluronan can act as a leukocyte
recruitment molecule and in the most common mouse model of intestinal
inflammation, the chemically induced dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) experimental
colitis model, we previously determined that changes in colon distribution of HA 
occur before inflammation. Therefore, we hypothesized that, during a pathologic
challenge, HA promotes inflammation. In this study, we tested the progression of 
inflammation in mice null for the hyaluronan synthase genes (HAS1, HAS3, or both 
HAS1 and HAS3) in the DSS-colitis model. Our data demonstrate that both the
HAS1/HAS3 double and the HAS3 null mice are protected from colitis, compared to
wild-type and HAS1 null mice, as determined by measurement of weight loss,
disease activity, serum IL-6 levels, histologic scoring, and
immunohistochemistry. Most notable is the dramatic increase in submucosal
microvasculature, hyaluronan deposition, and leukocyte infiltration in the
inflamed colon tissue of wild-type and HAS1 null mice. Our data suggest, HAS3
plays a crucial role in driving gut inflammation. Developing a temporary targeted
therapeutic intervention of HAS3 expression or function in the microcirculation
may emerge as a desirable strategy toward tempering colitis in patients
undergoing flares of IBD.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have helped to
understand the genetic basis and pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD). However, understanding the functional and clinical consequences of the
associated alleles has not followed the same pace. In this review, we discuss how
studying the genetic predisposition to IBD has increased our understanding about 
IBD pathogenesis and how epigenetics is becoming more and more important. We
describe the potential clinical applications of genetics, and provide important
challenges in the field and the future steps to be taken.
RECENT FINDINGS: GWAS and meta-analyses have identified 163 loci associated with 
IBD, and have implicated key pathways in IBD pathogenesis. Only few of the
association signals correspond to nonsynonymous coding variation with a clear
effect on protein function. The majority of signals involve noncoding genetic
variation, of which a large part is related to gene expression changes. More
recently, expression and epigenetic studies in IBD are increasingly being
reported, and have shown that many effects seem to be highly cell-type
specific.Predictive genetic testing will not be for the immediate future for the 
majority of IBD patients. However, for the subset of patients with very-early
onset IBD, several causal mutations have been found. Predictive genetic panels
for these adolescents presenting with a very severe disease course, and/or
families with high penetrance of disease will be of benefit.
SUMMARY: Genetic, transcriptomic and epigenetic studies have offered exciting
clues about IBD pathogenesis but are unlikely to provide all answers. To fully
grasp the function of disease-associated genetic variants, identifying causal
genes and translating this knowledge into predictive biomarkers and new
treatments, we should now integrate all these disciplines.

CD4(+)FOXP3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells are essential for maintaining
immunological self-tolerance. Treg cell development and function depend on the
transcription factor FOXP3, which is present in several distinct isoforms due to 
alternative splicing. Despite the importance of FOXP3 in the proper maintenance
of Treg cells, the regulation and functional consequences of FOXP3 isoform
expression remains poorly understood. Here, we show that in human Treg cells
IL-1β promotes excision of FOXP3 exon 7. FOXP3 is not only expressed by Treg
cells but is also transiently expressed when naïve T cells differentiate into
Th17 cells. Forced splicing of FOXP3 into FOXP3Δ2Δ7 strongly favored Th17
differentiation in vitro. We also found that patients with Crohn's disease
express increased levels of FOXP3 transcripts lacking exon 7, which correlate
with disease severity and IL-17 production. Our results demonstrate that
alternative splicing of FOXP3 modulates T cell differentiation. These results
highlight the importance of characterizing FOXP3 expression on an isoform basis
and suggest that immune responses may be manipulated by modulating the expression
of FOXP3 isoforms, which has broad implications for the treatment of autoimmune
diseases.

Prostaglandin E2 plays important roles in the maintenance of colonic homeostasis.
The recently identified prostaglandin E receptor (EP) 4-associated protein
(EPRAP) is essential for an anti-inflammatory function of EP4 signaling in
macrophages in vitro. To investigate the in vivo roles of EPRAP, we examined the 
effects of EPRAP on colitis and colitis-associated tumorigenesis. In mice, EPRAP 
deficiency exacerbated colitis induced by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) treatment.
Wild-type (WT) or EPRAP-deficient recipients transplanted with EPRAP-deficient
bone marrow developed more severe DSS-induced colitis than WT or EPRAP-deficient 
recipients of WT bone marrow. In the context of colitis-associated tumorigenesis,
both systemic EPRAP null mutation and EPRAP-deficiency in the bone marrow
enhanced intestinal polyp formation induced by azoxymethane (AOM)/DSS treatment. 
Administration of an EP4-selective agonist, ONO-AE1-329, ameliorated DSS-induced 
colitis in WT, but not in EPRAP-deficient mice. EPRAP deficiency increased the
levels of the phosphorylated forms of p105, MEK, and ERK, resulting in activation
of stromal macrophages in DSS-induced colitis. Macrophages of DSS-treated
EPRAP-deficient mice exhibited a marked increase in the expression of
pro-inflammatory genes, relative to WT mice. By contrast, forced expression of
EPRAP in macrophages ameliorated DSS-induced colitis and AOM/DSS-induced
intestinal polyp formation. These data suggest that EPRAP in macrophages
functions crucially in suppressing colonic inflammation. Consistently,
EPRAP-positive macrophages were also accumulated in the colonic stroma of
ulcerative colitis patients. Thus, EPRAP may be a potential therapeutic target
for inflammatory bowel disease and associated intestinal tumorigenesis.

AIM: Etiopathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease is unclear and results from a
complex interplay of genetic, microbial, environmental and immune factors.
Elucidating the mechanisms that drive IBD depends on the detailed
characterization of human inflammatory mediators in animal models. Therefore, we 
studied how intestinal inflammation affects heparanase, NF-κB and Hsp70 gene
expression in rats, and if current intestinal anti-inflammatory drugs
(sulphasalazine, prednisolone and azathioprine) act on these expressions.
Moreover, we investigated the relationships among these genes with colonic
cytokines levels (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, INF-γ and IL-10) and oxidative stress that 
have fundamental role in IBD.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Macroscopic parameters (diarrhea, extension of lesion,
colonic weight/length ratio and damage score), biochemical markers
(myeloperoxidase and alkaline phosphatase activities, and glutathione, IL-1β,
TNF-α, IL-6, INF-γ and IL-10 levels), gene expressions (heparanase, NF-κB and
Hsp70), and microscopic evaluations (optic, electronic scanning and transmission 
microscopic) were performed in rats.
KEY FINDINGS: Expression of heparanase, Hsp70 and NF-κB and oxidative stress were
increased by inflammatory process and differentially modulated by sulphasalazine,
prednisolone and azathioprine treatments. Protective effects of drugs were also
related to differential modulation of cytokine changes induced by inflammatory
process, showing different mechanisms to control inflammation.
SIGNIFICANCE: Heparanase, NF-κB and Hsp70 gene expression participate in the
inflammatory response induced by TNBS and represent pharmacological targets of
the intestinal anti-inflammatory drugs. In addition, current drugs used to treat 
IBD (sulphasalazine, prednisolone and azathioprine) differentially modulate
heparanase, NF-κB and Hsp70 gene expression, cytokine production and oxidative
stress.

In the intestinal tract, IL-22 activates STAT3 to promote intestinal epithelial
cell (IEC) homeostasis and tissue healing. The mechanism has remained obscure,
but we demonstrate that IL-22 acts via tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2), a member of the 
Jak family. Using a mouse model for colitis, we show that Tyk2 deficiency is
associated with an altered composition of the gut microbiota and exacerbates
inflammatory bowel disease. Colitic Tyk2(-/-) mice have less p-STAT3 in colon
tissue and their IECs proliferate less efficiently. Tyk2-deficient primary IECs
show reduced p-STAT3 in response to IL-22 stimulation, and expression of
IL-22-STAT3 target genes is reduced in IECs from healthy and colitic Tyk2(-/-)
mice. Experiments with conditional Tyk2(-/-) mice reveal that IEC-specific
depletion of Tyk2 aggravates colitis. Disease symptoms can be alleviated by
administering high doses of rIL-22-Fc, indicating that Tyk2 deficiency can be
rescued via the IL-22 receptor complex. The pivotal function of Tyk2 in
IL-22-dependent colitis was confirmed in Citrobacter rodentium-induced disease.
Thus, Tyk2 protects against acute colitis in part by amplifying
inflammation-induced epithelial IL-22 signaling to STAT3.

Azathioprine (AZA) is a thiopurine prodrug which is widely used in patients with 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the use is limited in one-third of
patients because of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) or a lack of clinical response.
It has been considered that the polymorphic enzyme thiopurine S-methyltransferase
(TPMT) plays an important role in the in vivo process of AZA and the occurrence
of its myelotoxicity. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) mutation is another
pharmacogenetic polymorphism which is probably involved in AZA metabolism and
tolerance. The aim of this study was to investigate the association among GST
polymorphism, enzyme activity and AZA-related ADRs in Chinese Han patients with
IBD. We found that the patients who became neutropenic had a significantly higher
GSTs activity when compared with of the patients who did not develop ADRs
(analysis of variance, P < 0.001). There was also a significant
underrepresentation of GSTP1*-105V allele among patients developing ADRs (odds
ratio [OR] = 0.125, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.022-0.709, P = 0.0012). The 
patients with higher GST activity constituted a pharmacogenetic high risk group
for leucopenia during AZA treatment. GST-P1 Ile105/Ile105 genotype appeared to be
a promising marker indicating predisposition to AZA-related ADRs.

BACKGROUND: Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) has recently been associated with
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The objective of this study is to investigate
the prevalence of HS in IBD and to identify clinical and genetic parameters
associated with HS in IBD.
METHODS: A questionnaire, validated for HS, was sent to 1969 patients suffering
from IBD.
RESULTS: The prevalence of HS in our IBD cohort (1260 participating patients) was
significantly higher than in the general population (6.8%-10.6% versus 1%-2%).
IBD patients with HS were affected by IBD significantly earlier and more often
treated with anti-TNF-α therapy and surgical resection compared to IBD without
HS. Female gender, smoking, a higher body mass index, and younger age were
independent associated parameters for HS. Within cases allelic association
analysis was performed for 59 cases (IBD with HS) and 293 controls (IBD without
HS). We observed 2 promising new associations in genomic regions harboring ELOVL7
(rsnumber 10057395 P = 7.15 × 10, odds ratio = 0.4), and in the intergenic region
between SULT1B1 and SULT1E1 (rsnumber 2014777 P = 7.48 × 10, odds ratio = 2.3).
CONCLUSIONS: HS is present in 6.8% to 10.6% of IBD patients. Co-morbid HS is
associated with an early onset of IBD in which anti-tumor necrosis factor-α
therapy and surgical resections are often needed. We identified a suggestive
protective association with ELOVL7 and suggestive risk association with the genes
SULT1B1 and SULT1E1 for HS, in the context of IBD. These genetic associations
need further exploration and replication in additional independent cohorts.

AIM: To investigate the association between tumor protein 53 (TP53) codon 72
polymorphisms and the risk for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) development.
METHODS: Numerous genetic and epigenetic drivers have been identified for IBD
including the TP53 gene. Pathogenic mutations in TP53 gene have only been
reported in 50% of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. A single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) in the TP53 gene resulting in the presence of either arginine 
(Arg) or proline (Pro) or both at codon 72 was shown to alter TP53
tumor-suppressor properties. This SNP has been investigated as a risk factor for 
numerous cancers, including CRC. In this study we analyzed TP53 codon 72
polymorphism distribution in 461 IBD, 181 primary sclerosing cholangitis patients
and 62 healthy controls. Genotyping of TP53 was performed by sequencing and
restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of genomic DNA extracted from
peripheral blood.
RESULTS: The most frequent TP53 genotype in IBD patients was Arg/Arg occurring in
54%-64% of cases (and in only 32% of controls). Arg/Pro was the most prevalent
genotype in controls (53%) and less common in patients (31%-40%). Pro/Pro
frequency was not significantly different between controls and IBD patients.
CONCLUSION: The data suggests that the TP53 codon 72 Arg/Arg genotype is
associated with increased risk for IBD development.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are heterogeneous
disorders with complex aetiology. Quantitative genetic studies suggest that only 
a small proportion of the disease variance observed in IBD is accounted for by
genetic variation, indicating a potential role for differential epigenetic
regulation in disease aetiology. The aim of this study was to assess genome-wide 
DNA methylation changes specifically associated with ulcerative colitis (UC),
Crohn's disease (CD) and IBD activity.
METHODS: DNA methylation was quantified in peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) from 149 IBD cases (61 UC, 88 CD) and 39 controls using the Infinium
HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Technical and functional validation was performed
using pyrosequencing and the real-time polymerase chain reaction. Cross-tissue
replication of the top differentially methylated positions (DMPs) was tested in
colonic mucosa tissue samples obtained from paediatric IBD cases and controls.
RESULTS: A total of 3196 probes were differentially methylated between CD cases
and controls, while 1481 probes were differentially methylated between UC cases
and controls. There was considerable (45%) overlap between UC and CD DMPs. The
top-ranked IBD-associated PBMC differentially methylated region (promoter region 
of TRIM39-RPP2) was also significantly hypomethylated in colonic mucosa from
paediatric UC patients. In addition, we confirmed TRAF6 hypermethylation using
pyrosequencing and found reduced TRAF6 gene expression in PBMCs of IBD patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide new insights into differential epigenetic
regulation of genes and molecular pathways, which may contribute to the
pathogenesis and activity of IBD.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the associations of death receptor DR4 and DR5 gene
polymorphisms with Crohn's disease (CD).
METHODS: A total of 295 CD patients and 490 healthy controls were recruited.
Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the DR4 (rs13278062, rs20575) and
DR5 (rs1047266) genes were determined with a SNaPshot method. Unconditional
logistic regression analysis was carried out for determining the allelic and
genotypic differences of the three SNPs between CD patients and the controls, as 
well as the influence of the DR4 and DR5 gene polymorphisms on the clinical
features of CD patients. Linkage disequilibrium and haplotype analysis were
calculated by haplotype 4.2 and R language software. A gene-gene interaction
model was established to analyze whether the three SNPs can exert a synergistic
effect on the susceptibility to CD.
RESULTS: The mutant allele (T) and genotype (GT+TT) of DR4 (rs13278062) were
increased among CD patients compared to the controls (37.12% vs. 32.04%, P =
0.040, 95%CI: 1.010-1.550; 62.71% vs. 54.90%, P = 0.032, 95%CI: 1.028-1.855,
respectively). However, the allelic and genotypic frequencies of DR4 (rs20575)
and DR5 (rs1047266) did not differ between the two groups (all P > 0.05). Based
on the Montreal Classification Standards, the CD patients were stratified by
locations and behaviors of the disease. After multiple comparison correction (P <
0.0125), compared to ileocolonic CD patients respectively, the mutant allele (T) 
and genotype (GT+TT) of the rs13278062 polymorphism were significantly increased 
in colonic CD patients (41.04% vs. 25.64%, P = 0.002, 95%CI: 0.315-0.778; 66.04% 
vs. 41.03%, P = 0.001, 95%CI: 0.196-0.655, respectively) and terminal ileum CD
patients (41.44% vs. 25.64%, P = 0.002, 95%CI: 0.311-0.762; 74.77% vs. 41.03%, P 
< 0.001, 95%CI: 0.126-0.437, respectively). In comparison to penetrating CD
patients, the mutant allele (T) and genotype (GT+TT) of DR4 (rs13278062) were
significantly decreased in stricturing CD patients (32.29% vs. 48.91%, P = 0.007,
95%CI: 0.300-0.828; 57.29% vs. 86.96%, P = 0.001, 95%CI: 0.078-0.520,
respectively). A similar conclusion was drawn for the mutant genotype (GT+TT) of 
DR4 (rs13278062) in non-stricturing, non-penetrating CD patients (58.82% vs.
86.96%, P = 0.001, 95%CI: 0.086-0.536). Haplotype analysis indicated that the CT 
haplotype formed by rs20575 and rs13278062 was increased in CD patients compared 
to the controls (37.1% vs. 31.8%, P = 0.029, OR=1.279, 95%CI: 1.022-1.600). The
outcome of a gene-gene interaction model indicated that the mutant genotype
(GT+TT) of DR4 (rs13278062) and mutant genotype (CT+TT) of DR5 (rs1047266) may
play a negatively synergistic role in CD patients (B = - 0.483, OR = 0.617, P =
0.030).
CONCLUSION: The rs13278062 polymorphism of the DR4 gene not only can confer an
increased risk for CD, but may also influence the location of the lesions and the
disease behaviors. The CT haplotype formed by rs20575 and rs13278062 may be an
independent risk factor for CD. Furthermore, the mutant genotype (GT+TT) of DR4
(rs13278062) and mutant genotype (CT+TT) of DR5 (rs1047266) may exert a negative 
synergistic effect on CD.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Anti-tumour necrosis factor [TNF] antibodies induce
regulatory macrophages which display a phenotype resembling M2 type macrophages. 
Anti-TNF induced macrophages [Mϕind] have immunosuppressive and wound healing
properties. The factors that contribute to the induction of Mϕind remain to be
explored. Autophagy has been described as a factor that is important for the
induction and function of M2 type macrophages. We studied the contribution of
autophagy to the induction of Mϕind.
METHODS: We studied the effect of autophagy on Mϕind in vitro using peripheral
blood mononuclear cells. Interferon gamma [IFN-γ] induced macrophages [Mφ1] were 
generated by culturing monocytes in the presence of IFN-γ. Mϕind were generated
by performing mixed lymphocyte reactions [MLR] in the presence of anti-TNF
antibodies; 28 healthy donors were genotyped for rs_2241880 [ATG16L1]. Cells were
analysed by autophagy gene array, immunofluorescence, western blot,
flowcytometry, 3H-thymidine incorporation and MTS assay.
RESULTS: Mϕind had a different expression profile of autophagy related
transcripts with increased expression of 33/40 altered genes compared with Mφ1.
In addition, autophagic activity was increased in Mϕind compared with Mφ1.
Induction of Mϕind was positively correlated to the number of wild-type alleles
for the ATG16L1 T300A risk allele present in the culture. Finally, the
autophagy-related protein cathepsin S was highly expressed in Mφind and
inhibition resulted in decreased viability as well as decreased expression of
CD206.
CONCLUSIONS: Mϕind have increased levels of autophagy compared with inflammatory 
Mφ1, and the induction of these macrophages is impaired in donors carrying the
T300A risk allele for the ATG16L1. Given the association between Mϕind and
clinical response, this suggests that an intact autophagy pathway may be
important for an optimal response to anti-TNF therapy in inflammatory bowel
disease.

PURPOSE: Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes have been widely studied in
adult inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but data on MHC genes are scarce in
pediatric IBD. This study focused on MHC association of genes with
pediatric-onset IBD and its different phenotypes.
METHODS: Blood samples of 103 patients with pediatric IBD (Crohn disease or
ulcerative colitis) were collected at Children's Hospital, University of
Helsinki, Finland. HLA-A, -B, -DRB1 alleles and complement C4A and C4B gene copy 
numbers were determined and constructed into haplotypes by a Bayesian algorithm
(PHASE). A general population cohort (n = 149) served as a control. HLA-alleles
and C4 deficiency frequencies were compared between patients and controls with
χ-squared and Fisher exact test with Bonferroni correction (Pcorr).
RESULTS: One MHC haplotype HLA-A03; HLA-B07; 1 C4A gene; 1 C4B gene; HLA-DRB115
was more common in Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis than in controls (7/61,
11.5%, 6/42, 14.3% and 1/149, 0.7%, respectively, odds ratio (OR) = 19.19, 95% CI
2.31-159.57, Pcorr = 0.004 for Crohn disease vs controls and OR = 24.67, 95% CI
2.88-211.36, Pcorr = 0.002 for ulcerative colitis vs controls). Two MHC markers
were associated with clinical characteristics. HLA-DRB101 was more common in
patients with milder disease course, that is, no need for anti-tumor necrosis
factor (TNF)-α medication (18/32, 56.2% vs 19/71, 26.8% without and with
anti-TNF-α medication, respectively, OR = 0.28, 95% CI 0.12-0.68, Pcorr = 0.032).
C4B deficiency (<2 C4B genes) was associated with complicated recovery after
surgery (12/16, 75.0% vs 4/16, 25.0%, respectively, OR = 9.00, 95% CI 1.82-44.59,
Pcorr = 0.025).
CONCLUSIONS: One MHC haplotype is strongly linked with pediatric-onset IBD,
whereas the need for immunomodulatory therapy and surgery outcome associates with
other distinct MHC gene markers.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic intestinal inflammatory condition
that is mediated by very complex mechanisms controlled by genetic, immune, and
environmental factors. More than 74 kinds of genetically engineered mouse strains
have been established since 1993 for studying IBD. Although mouse models cannot
fully reflect human IBD, they have provided significant contributions for not
only understanding the mechanism, but also developing new therapeutic means for
IBD. Indeed, 20 kinds of genetically engineered mouse models carry the
susceptibility genes identified in human IBD, and the functions of some other IBD
susceptibility genes have also been dissected out using mouse models.
Cutting-edge technologies such as cell-specific and inducible knockout systems,
which were recently employed to mouse IBD models, have further enhanced the
ability of investigators to provide important and unexpected rationales for
developing new therapeutic strategies for IBD. In this review article, we briefly
introduce 74 kinds of genetically engineered mouse models that spontaneously
develop intestinal inflammation.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease whose
pathogenesis is multifactorial and includes influences from genes, the
environment, and the gut microbiome. Recent advances in diagnosis and treatment
have led to significant improvement in managing the disease. Disease monitoring
with the use of therapeutic drug monitoring, stool markers, and assessment of
mucosal healing have garnered much attention. The recent approval of vedolizumab 
for treatment of moderate to severe UC has been a welcome addition. Newer
biologics, including those targeting the Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK) pathway, are
on the horizon to add to the current armamentarium of anti-TNF alpha and
anti-integrin therapies. The recent publication of the SCENIC consensus statement
on surveillance and management of dysplasia in UC patients supports the use of
chromoendoscopy over random biopsies in detecting dysplasia. This review
highlights these recent advances along with others that have been made with
ulcerative colitis.

AIM: To evaluate the correlations between cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated
antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and multi-drug resistance 1 (MDR1) genes polymorphisms with
ulcerative colitis (UC) risk.
METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CBM databases,
Springerlink, Wiley, EBSCO, Ovid, Wanfang database, VIP database, China National 
Knowledge Infrastructure, and Weipu Journal databases were exhaustively searched 
using combinations of keywords relating to CTLA-4, MDR1 and UC. The published
studies were filtered using our stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria, the
quality assessment for each eligible study was conducted using Critical Appraisal
Skill Program and the resultant high-quality data from final selected studies
were analyzed using Comprehensive Meta-analysis 2.0 (CMA 2.0) software. The
correlations between SNPs of CTLA-4 gene, MDR1 gene and the risk of UC were
evaluated by OR at 95%CI. Z test was carried out to evaluate the significance of 
overall effect values. Cochran's Q-statistic and I(2) tests were applied to
quantify heterogeneity among studies. Funnel plots, classic fail-safe N and
Egger's linear regression test were inspected for indication of publication bias.
RESULTS: A total of 107 studies were initially retrieved and 12 studies were
eventually selected for meta-analysis. These 12 case-control studies involved
1860 UC patients and 2663 healthy controls. Our major result revealed that single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of CTLA-4 gene rs3087243 G > A and rs231775 G > A
may increase the risk of UC (rs3087243 G > A: allele model: OR = 1.365, 95%CI:
1.023-1.822, P = 0.035; dominant model: OR = 1.569, 95%CI: 1.269-1.940, P <
0.001; rs231775 G > A: allele model: OR = 1.583, 95%CI: = 1.306-1.918, P < 0.001;
dominant model: OR = 1.805, 95%CI: 1.393-2.340, P < 0.001). In addition, based on
our result, SNPs of MDR1 gene rs1045642 C > T might also confer a significant
increases for the risk of UC (allele model: OR = 1.389, 95%CI: 1.214-1.590, P <
0.001; dominant model: OR = 1.518, 95%CI: 1.222-1.886, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: CTLA-4 gene rs3087243 G > A and rs231775 G > A, and MDR1 gene
rs1045642 C > T might confer an increase for UC risk.

BACKGROUND: The human gut microbiota comprises approximately 100 trillion
microbial cells which significantly impact many aspects of human physiology -
including metabolism, nutrient absorption and immune function. Disturbances in
this population have been implicated in many conditions and diseases, including
obesity, type-2 diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease. This suggests that
targeted manipulation or shaping of the gut microbiota, by bacteriocins and other
antimicrobials, has potential as a therapeutic tool for the prevention or
treatment of these conditions. With this in mind, several studies have used
traditional culture-dependent approaches to successfully identify
bacteriocin-producers from the mammalian gut. In silico-based approaches to
identify novel gene clusters are now also being utilised to take advantage of the
vast amount of data currently being generated by next generation sequencing
technologies. In this study, we employed an in silico screening approach to mine 
potential bacteriocin clusters in genome-sequenced isolates from the
gastrointestinal tract (GIT). More specifically, the bacteriocin genome-mining
tool BAGEL3 was used to identify potential bacteriocin producers in the genomes
of the GIT subset of the Human Microbiome Project's reference genome database.
Each of the identified gene clusters were manually annotated and potential
bacteriocin-associated genes were evaluated.
RESULTS: We identified 74 clusters of note from 59 unique members of the
Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria and Synergistetes. The
most commonly identified class of bacteriocin was the >10 kDa class, formerly
known as bacteriolysins, followed by lantibiotics and sactipeptides.
CONCLUSIONS: Multiple bacteriocin gene clusters were identified in a dataset
representative of the human gut microbiota. Interestingly, many of these were
associated with species and genera which are not typically associated with
bacteriocin production.

Previous studies have identified the immunological functions of transcription
factor B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1 (Blimp-1) in various adaptive
immune cell types such as T and B lymphocytes. More recently, it has been shown
that Blimp-1 extends its functional roles to dendritic cells (DCs) and
macrophages, two cell types belonging to the innate immune system. The protein
acts as a direct and indirect regulator of target genes by recruiting chromatin
modification factors and by regulating microRNA expression, respectively. In DCs,
Blimp-1 has been identified as one of the components involved in antigen
presentation. Genome-wide association studies identified polymorphisms associated
with multiple autoimmune diseases such as system lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid 
arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease in PRDM1, the gene encoding Blimp-1
protein. In this review, we will discuss the immune regulatory functions of
Blimp-1 in DCs with a main focus on the tolerogenic mechanisms of Blimp-1
required to protect against the development of autoimmune diseases.

DNA methylation is one of the major epigenetic mechanisms implicated in
regulating cellular development and cell-type-specific gene expression. Here we
performed simultaneous genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression analysis
on purified intestinal epithelial cells derived from human fetal gut, healthy
pediatric biopsies, and children newly diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease 
(IBD). Results were validated using pyrosequencing, real-time PCR, and
immunostaining. The functional impact of DNA methylation changes on gene
expression was assessed by employing in-vitro assays in intestinal cell lines.
DNA methylation analyses allowed identification of 214 genes for which expression
is regulated via DNA methylation, i.e. regulatory differentially methylated
regions (rDMRs). Pathway and functional analysis of rDMRs suggested a critical
role for DNA methylation in regulating gene expression and functional development
of the human intestinal epithelium. Moreover, analysis performed on intestinal
epithelium of children newly diagnosed with IBD revealed alterations in DNA
methylation within genomic loci, which were found to overlap significantly with
those undergoing methylation changes during intestinal development. Our study
provides novel insights into the physiological role of DNA methylation in
regulating functional maturation of the human intestinal epithelium. Moreover, we
provide data linking developmentally acquired alterations in the DNA methylation 
profile to changes seen in pediatric IBD.

BACKGROUND: The composition of bacteria in and on the human body varies widely
across human individuals, and has been associated with multiple health
conditions. While microbial communities are influenced by environmental factors, 
some degree of genetic influence of the host on the microbiome is also expected. 
This study is part of an expanding effort to comprehensively profile the
interactions between human genetic variation and the composition of this
microbial ecosystem on a genome- and microbiome-wide scale.
RESULTS: Here, we jointly analyze the composition of the human microbiome and
host genetic variation. By mining the shotgun metagenomic data from the Human
Microbiome Project for host DNA reads, we gathered information on host genetic
variation for 93 individuals for whom bacterial abundance data are also
available. Using this dataset, we identify significant associations between host 
genetic variation and microbiome composition in 10 of the 15 body sites tested.
These associations are driven by host genetic variation in immunity-related
pathways, and are especially enriched in host genes that have been previously
associated with microbiome-related complex diseases, such as inflammatory bowel
disease and obesity-related disorders. Lastly, we show that host genomic regions 
associated with the microbiome have high levels of genetic differentiation among 
human populations, possibly indicating host genomic adaptation to
environment-specific microbiomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the role of host genetic variation in shaping 
the composition of the human microbiome, and provide a starting point toward
understanding the complex interaction between human genetics and the microbiome
in the context of human evolution and disease.

Campylobacter jejuni is the most common cause of bacterium-induced
gastroenteritis, and while typically self-limiting, C. jejuni infections are
associated with postinfectious intestinal disorders, including flares in patients
with inflammatory bowel disease and postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome
(PI-IBS), via mechanisms that remain obscure. Based on the hypothesis that acute 
campylobacteriosis may cause pathogenic microbiota dysbiosis, we investigated
whether C. jejuni may activate dormant virulence genes in noninvasive Escherichia
coli and examined the epithelial pathophysiological consequences of these
alterations. Microarray and quantitative real-time PCR analyses revealed that E. 
coli adhesin, flagellum, and hemolysin gene expression were increased when E.
coli was exposed to C. jejuni-conditioned medium. Increased development of
bacterial flagella upon exposure to live C. jejuni or C. jejuni-conditioned
medium was observed under transmission electron microscopy. Atomic force
microscopy demonstrated that the forces of bacterial adhesion to colonic T84
enterocytes, and the work required to rupture this adhesion, were significantly
increased in E. coli exposed to C. jejuni-conditioned media. Finally, C.
jejuni-modified E. coli disrupted TLR4 gene expression and induced
proinflammatory CXCL-8 gene expression in colonic enterocytes. Together, these
data suggest that exposure to live C. jejuni, and/or to its secretory-excretory
products, may activate latent virulence genes in noninvasive E. coli and that
these alterations may directly trigger proinflammatory signaling in intestinal
epithelia. These observations shed new light on mechanisms that may contribute,
at least in part, to postcampylobacteriosis inflammatory disorders.

The discovery of nonclassical actions, other than mineral homeostasis, of 1α,25- 
dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3) has expanded its applications. Among these, its
anti-inflammation activity has drawn more and more attention of researchers to
investigate its role in regulating the progression of inflammatory diseases. The 
expression of many inflammation-related genes is regulated by 1,25D3 through
vitamin D receptor (VDR) in a large variety of cells including immune cells such 
as, but not limited to, macrophages, dendritic cells, T helper cells, and B
cells. Studies of 1,25D3 in these immune cells have shown both direct and
indirect immunomodulatory activities affecting innate and adaptive immune
responses. Moreover, 1,25D3 can also exert its anti-inflammation effects through 
regulating the biosynthesis of pro-inflammatory molecules in the prostaglandin
pathway or through nuclear factor kappa light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells
(NFκB) by affecting cytokine production and inflammatory responses. These actions
of 1,25D3 may explain the associations between vitamin D levels and inflammatory 
diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple
sclerosis, asthma, type 1 diabetes, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Although
several analogs of 1,25D3 have shown potent immunomodulatory or anti-inflammatory
activity on immune cell cultures or in animal models, no vitamin D analog has
been used in clinical research to treat inflammatory diseases. Here, we review
the relationship between vitamin D analogs and inflammation based on observations
of immune cells, prostaglandin and NFκB pathways, as well as common inflammatory 
diseases.

Peritoneal fibrosis (PF), a serious pathophysiology of peritoneal dialysis (PD), 
is implicated in various types of chronic inflammation. In the present study, we 
examined the benefits of interleukin (IL)-10, which exerts anti-inflammatory
effects, in an experimental rat model of methylglyoxal (MGO)-induced PF. We
injected an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector encoding rat IL-10 or enhanced
green fluorescent protein (GFP) into male Sprague-Dawley rats at 6 weeks of age. 
Four weeks later, the rats received continuous peritoneal injections of
conventional PD fluid (PDF) with MGO for 3 weeks. Then, the peritoneal histology 
and the expression levels of fibrogenic mediators and proinflammatory cytokines
were analyzed. The rats demonstrating persistent IL-10 expression showed
significantly reduced fibrous peritoneal thickening compared with those with GFP 
expression. The infiltration of macrophages, the expression of tumor necrosis
factor-α, IL-1β, IL-6, transforming growth factor-β1, Snail, and matrix
metalloproteinase 2 genes as well as the proliferation of mesenchymal-like
mesothelial cells augmented by MGO were all significantly suppressed by IL-10
expression. IL-10 also abrogated the extent of MGO-induced bowel adhesions
mimicking a cocoon-like mass. Our findings provide valuable insight into the
potential benefit of immunomodulation with IL-10 as one potentially effective
therapeutic strategy for preventing the onset of peritoneal injury resulting in
PF.

Understanding Microbiome Data: A Primer for Clinicians.

Seksik P, Landman C.

The human gut contains 1014 bacteria and many other micro-organisms such as
Archaea, viruses and fungi. This gut microbiota has co-evolved with host
determinants through symbiotic and co-dependent relationships. Bacteria, which
represent 10 times the number of human cells, form the most depicted part of this
black box owing to new tools. Re-evaluating the gut microbiota showed how this
entity participates in gut physiology and beyond this in human health. Studying
and handling this real 'hidden organ' remains a challenge for clinicians. In this
review, we aimed to bring information about gut microbiota, its structure, its
roles and the way to capture and measure it. After bacterial colonization in
infant, intestinal microbial composition is unique for each individual although
more than 95% can be assigned to 4 major phyla. Besides its biodiversity, the
major characteristics of gut microbiota are stability over time and resilience
after perturbation. In pathological situations, dysbiosis (i.e. imbalance in gut 
microbiota composition) is observed with a loss in overall diversity. Dysbiosis
associated with inflammatory bowel disease was specified with the reduction in
biodiversity, the decreased representation of different taxa in the Firmicutes
phylum and an increase in Gammaproteobacteria. Beyond depicting gut microbial
composition, metagenomics allows the description of the combined genomes of the
microorganisms present in the gut, giving access to their potential functions. In
fact, each individual overall microbial metagenome outnumbers the size of human
genome by a factor of 150. Besides a functional core in which there is redundancy
for mandatory functions assuring the robustness of the ecosystem, human gut
contains an important diversity and high number of non-redundant bacterial genes.
Clinical data, treatment and all the factors able to influence microbiome should 
enter integrated big data sets to put in light pathways of interplay within the
supra organism composed of gut microbiome and host. A better understanding of
dynamics within human gut microbiota and microbes-host interaction will allow new
insight into gut pathophysiology especially regarding resilience mechanisms and
dysbiosis onset and maintenance. This will lead to description of biomarkers of
diseases, development of new probiotics/prebiotics and new therapies.

Azathioprine (AZA) is frequently used in patients with inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD). However, toxic adverse reactions frequently develop and limit the clinical
benefits. Currently, the precise mechanisms underlying thiopurine-related
toxicity are not well understood. To investigate the relationship between the
extent of thiopurine metabolism and adverse reactions in Japanese IBD patients,
we prospectively observed 48 IBD patients who received AZA. We analyzed the
thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) and inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase
(ITPA) gene mutations and measured the concentrations of 6-thioguanine nucleotide
(6-TGN) continuously for 52 weeks. All patients possessed wild-type TPMT gene
sequences. The ITPA 94C>A mutation was detected in 19 patients (39.6%). Adverse
reactions developed in 14 of the 48 patients (29.2%), including leukopenia in 10 
patients (20.8%). In the leukopenia group, the percentages of patients with 94C>A
were higher than those in the without-leukopenia group (70.0% vs. 31.6%, P <
0.05). The average concentrations of 6-TGN in the patients with 94C>A were
generally higher than those in the patients without 94C>A, however, there were no
significant differences. Only 3 out of 10 patients with leukopenia exhibited high
6-TGN levels (30.0%). No negative correlations between white blood cell (WBC)
counts and 6-TGN concentrations were observed. The cumulative incidence of
leukopenia were higher for patients with 94C>A. Seven out of 19 patients (36.8%) 
with the ITPA 94C>A mutation developed leukopenia; however, this mutation may not
unequivocally increase the risk of developing leukopenia. In addition, there are 
factors other than increased 6-TGN levels that are involved in the onset of
leukopenia.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of Crohn's disease (CD) with vitamin D 
receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] level.
METHODS: A total of 297 CD patients and 446 healthy controls were enrolled in our
study. Four single nucleosides of VDR (Fok I, Bsm I, Apa I and Taq I) were
genotyped by SNaPshot. Serum 25(OH)D levels were tested by
electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay in 124 CD patients and 188 matched random
controls.
RESULTS: By Chi-square test and Bonferroni correction, the frequencies of mutant 
allele (A) and mutant genotype (GA+AA) of Bsm I were significantly decreased in
CD patients compared to controls [3.70% (22/594) vs 7.51% (67/892), 95% CI
0.289-0.776, P=0.002; 7.41%(22/297) vs 14.80% (66/446), 95% CI 0.277-0.765,
P=0.002, respectively]. The similar results were seen for the mutant allele (C)
and mutant genotype (TC+CC) of Taq I [4.21% (25/594) vs 7.62% (68/892), 95% CI
0.333-0.852, P=0.008; 8.42% (25/297) vs 14.57% (65/446), 95% CI 0.331-0.877,
P=0.012]. The analyses of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and haplotype were
performed by Haploview 4.2 and R software, respectively. The Bsm I, Apa I and Taq
I polymorphic loci were found to be in a strong LD, and the AAC haplotype was
significantly reduced in CD patients compared to controls [3.14% vs 6.46%, 95% CI
0.273-0.815, P=0.004]. The further serological analysis showed that average serum
25(OH)D level in CD patients was significantly lower than that of controls
[(15.46±8.11) µg/L vs (21.64±9.45) µg/L, P<0.001]. By linear regression analysis,
serum 25(OH)D levels in CD patients were negatively correlated to Crohn's disease
activity index (β=-0.829, P<0.001), platelet count (β=-0.253, P<0.001) and the
ratio of neutrophils (β=-0.136, P=0.005) independently, whereas positively
related to erythrocyte sedimentation rate (β=0.191, P=0.001). Furthermore,
logistic regression analysis was applied for establishing the models of
gene-environment interaction. In result, both the mutant genotype (CA+AA) of Apa 
I and vitamin D deficiency (<20 µg/L) were shown to be the independent risk
factors for CD (OR=7.580, 95% CI 2.983-19.261, P<0.001; OR=2.842, 95% CI
1.300-6.211, P=0.009, respectively). Besides, vitamin D deficiency in CD patients
had multiplicative interactions with the mutant genotype (TC+CC) of Fok I,
genotype (CA+AA) of Apa I and genotype (TC+CC) of Taq I, respectively (OR=0.419, 
95% CI 0.194-0.906, P=0.027; OR=0.309, 95% CI 0.111-0.855, P=0.024; OR=5.841, 95%
CI 1.082-31.538, P=0.040; respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: VDR (Bsm I, Apa I and Taq I) polymorphisms and serum 25(OH)D levels 
are significantly related to CD. Both the mutant genotype (CA+AA) of Apa I and
vitamin D deficiency are independent risk factors of CD. The mutations of VDR
(Fok I, Apa I and Taq I) and vitamin D deficiency might have a synergistic effect
on CD susceptibility.

Congenital sodium diarrhea (CSD) refers to an intractable diarrhea of
intrauterine onset with high fecal sodium loss. CSD is clinically and genetically
heterogeneous. Syndromic CSD is caused by SPINT2 mutations. While we recently
described four cases of the non-syndromic form of CSD that were caused by
dominant activating mutations in intestinal receptor guanylate cyclase C (GC-C), 
the genetic cause for the majority of CSD is still unknown. Therefore, we aimed
to determine the genetic cause for non-GC-C non-syndromic CSD in 18 patients from
16 unrelated families applying whole-exome sequencing and/or chromosomal
microarray analyses and/or direct Sanger sequencing. SLC9A3 missense, splicing
and truncation mutations, including an instance of uniparental disomy, and
whole-gene deletion were identified in nine patients from eight families with
CSD. Two of these nine patients developed inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) at 4
and 16 years of age. SLC9A3 encodes Na(+)/H(+) antiporter 3 (NHE3), which is the 
major intestinal brush-border Na(+)/H(+) exchanger. All mutations were in the
NHE3 N-terminal transport domain, and all missense mutations were in the putative
membrane-spanning domains. Identified SLC9A3 missense mutations were functionally
characterized in plasma membrane NHE null fibroblasts. SLC9A3 missense mutations 
compromised NHE3 activity by reducing basal surface expression and/or loss of
basal transport function of NHE3 molecules, whereas acute regulation was normal. 
This study identifies recessive mutations in NHE3, a downstream target of GC-C,
as a cause of CSD and implies primary basal NHE3 malfunction as a predisposition 
for IBD in a subset of patients.

Genome-wide association studies have identified and repeatedly confirmed the
association of rs3197999 in MST1 with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, 
the underlying pathophysiology remains unclear. rs3197999 is a non-synonymous
single-nucleotide polymorphism which modifies the function of macrophage
stimulating protein-1 (MST1). We show by haplotyping that rs3197999 is in linkage
disequilibrium with rs1050450 in GPX1, with almost complete cosegregation of the 
minor alleles. As shown by immunoassay, rs3197999 influences the MST-1 level in
serum. But also rs1050450 causes an amino acid exchange in glutathione peroxidase
1 (GPx-1) and reduced activity of this antioxidant enzyme. The association of GPx
deficiency and IBD in mice was already shown. We propose that GPx-1 is a better
candidate than MST1 for the pathophysiologic link between IBD locus 12 and IBD.

BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are characterized by chronic
relapsing inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract and encompass Crohn's
disease and ulcerative colitis. IBD are often associated with extraintestinal
manifestations affecting multiple organs including the liver. Increased levels of
serum aminotransferases, possibly related to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,
constitute one of the most frequently described IBD-related liver diseases. The
PNPLA3 I148M substitution is a major common genetic determinant of hepatic fat
content and progression to chronic liver disease. The aim of this study was to
investigate whether carriers of PNPLA3 148M allele with IBD have higher risk of
liver steatosis and increase in transaminases levels.
METHODS: The PNPLA3 I148M (rs738409) genotype was performed by Taqman assays in
158 individuals from Southern Italy (namely, Catanzaro cohort) and in 207
individuals from Northern Italy (namely, Milan cohort) with a definite diagnosis 
of IBD. Demographic and clinical data and also alanine transaminase levels were
collected for both cohorts. The Catanzaro cohort underwent liver evaluation by
sonography and liver stiffness and controlled attenuation parameter measurements 
by transient elastography.
RESULTS: Here, we show for the first time that carriers of the PNPLA3 148M allele
with IBD have a greater risk of hepatic steatosis (odds ratio, 2.9, and
confidence interval, 1.1-7.8), higher controlled attenuation parameter values (P 
= 0.029), and increased circulating alanine transaminase (P = 0.035) in the
Catanzaro cohort. We further confirm the higher alanine transaminase levels in
the Milan cohort (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that PNPLA3 148M carriers with IBD have higher
susceptibility to hepatic steatosis and liver damage.

Colonic epithelium is the first line of defense against various pathological
offenses in the gut. Previous studies have shown that the peptides of the
corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) family modulate vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF)-A production in other cells. Here we sought to investigate whether 
CRH and urocortin (Ucn) 3 regulate VEGF-A secretion in colonocytes through CRH
receptors and to elucidate the underlying mechanism of action. CRH and Ucn 3
significantly increased the expression levels of VEGF-A mRNA and protein through 
CRH receptor 1 and 2, respectively, in human colonic epithelial cells and primary
mouse intestinal epithelial cells. Underlying mechanisms involve activation of
adenylyl cyclase with subsequent increase of intracellular cAMP level and
increased DNA binding activity of transcription factor CREB on VEGF-A promoter
region. Finally, genetic deficiency of CREB decreased intestinal inflammation and
VEGF-A expression in a dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis model. These
results show that activation of CRH receptors by CRH ligands stimulates VEGF-A
expression in intestinal epithelial cells through the cAMP/CREB pathway. Since
VEGF-A boosts inflammatory responses through angiogenesis, these data suggest
that CREB may be a key effector of CRH and Ucn 3-dependent inflammatory
angiogenesis.

Studies suggest that consumption of omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids
(PUFA) plays a protective role in inflammatory bowel disease; however, the use of
plant-derived oils rich in α-linolenic acid (ALA) has not been widely
investigated. The aims of this study were to test the effects of two different
sources of (n-3) PUFA, fish and plant-derived oils, in two animal models of
experimental colitis and to determine whether the (n-3) PUFA-enriched diets could
ameliorate the inflammatory status. Rats were fed diets rich in corn, fish or
sage oil with or without vitamin A supplementation for 3weeks then colitis was
induced by adding dextran sodium sulfate to the drinking water or by injecting
2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid. We show that colitic rats fed the sage oil
diets had a lower inflammatory response, improved histological repair and had
less necrotic damage in the mucosa when compared to the corn and fish oil groups.
Colonic damage and myeloperoxidase activity were significantly lower. Colonic
mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory genes including interleukin IL-6, cyclooxygenase 
2 and tumor necrosis factor α were markedly down-regulated in rats fed fish and
sage oils compared to control. These results were supported by experiments in the
human colonic epithelial cell line Caco-2, where ALA supplementation was shown to
be effective in inhibiting inflammation induced by IL-1β by down-regulating mRNA 
levels of pro-inflammatory genes including IL-8, COX2 and inducible nitric oxide 
synthase. Taken together, these results suggest that plant-derived oil rich in
ALA could ameliorate the inflammatory damage in colitis.

The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and its proinflammatory
ligands are critically implicated in the pathological progression of ulcerative
colitis (UC). Functional polymorphisms in the regulatory elements and/or
ligand-binding regions of the RAGE gene affect the expression and function of
RAGE and thus may increase susceptibility to UC. In this study, a total of 266
unrelated UC patients and 247 control subjects were analyzed for 3 RAGE single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (-429 T/C, -374 T/A, and G82S) using an improved 
small-amplicon high resolution melting curve (HRM) analysis assay. Serum levels
of soluble RAGE (sRAGE) were determined by a double sandwich ELISA system. The
genotypes, alleles and haplotypes were analyzed and compared between UC patients 
and control subjects. Three pairs of genotyping primers for three RAGE
polymorphism loci (-429 T/C, -374 T/A, and G82S) were developed based on HRM.
Significant differences in the allele distribution of the G82S polymorphism was
found among UC cases and controls from a Chinese population. Carriers of the RAGE
G82S variant genotype were at higher risk of UC (OR=2.594, 95% CI: 1.778-3.784,
P<0.001) than homozygous wild-type individuals. Further analyses revealed that
the 82 (GS+SS) variant genotype was associated with patients who have extended UC
(OR=1.924, 95% CI: 1.163-3.181, P=0.010), and a family history of inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD) (OR=1.923, 95% CI: 1.049-3.521, P=0.032). The polymorphisms
-374 T/A and -429 T/C did not demonstrate any association with UC, but an
association was found between the -374(TA+AA) variant genotypes and the serum
sRAGE level (P=0.002). Moreover, haplotypes T/A/A and T/A/G showed significantly 
different frequencies between UC patients and controls (OR=3.337, 95% CI:
1.892-6.091, P=0.026; OR=0.530, 95% CI: 0.351-0.801, P=0.002). The present study 
developed novel primers based on HRM to provide preliminary evidence in a Chinese
population that the RAGE polymorphism is involved in genetic susceptibility to UC
and that the 82(GS+SS) genotype of G82S is a risk factor for UC. Furthermore,
RAGE polymorphisms may be related to the location of UC as well as a family
history of IBD in a Chinese population.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in horses is an idiopathic disorder,
encompassing different types of chronic intestinal inflammation. The pathogenesis
of the disease remains to be established, but it has been suggested that an
imbalance between regulatory T cells (Tregs) and T helper 17 (Th17)-associated
cytokines and altered toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression is associated with
intestinal inflammation in other species. The aim of the present study was to
quantify Tregs in rectal biopsies from horses affected with IBD by
immunohistochemistry and to evaluate expression of genes encoding interleukin
(IL)-12p40, IL-17A, IL-23p19 and TLR4 by real-time quantitative PCR. Rectal
biopsies from 11 healthy horses and 11 horses with clinical signs of IBD, showing
inflammation classified as chronic simple proctitis (CSP) or chronic active
simple proctitis (CASP), were evaluated. Expression of IL-17A mRNA was greater in
horses affected with CASP compared with horses with CSP or healthy horses. In
contrast, expression of IL-12p40 was lower in horses with CSP compared with
horses with CASP or healthy horses. TLR4 expression was greater in horses with
CASP compared with healthy horses. A positive correlation was seen between the
numbers of Tregs and expression of IL-17A and IL-23p19. An association was
demonstrated between the histopathological pattern of inflammation, cytokine
profile and number of infiltrating Tregs. The research findings suggest that Th17
cells are involved in active IBD, possibly through recruitment of neutrophils via
IL-17A, in combination with inadequate suppression of the inflammatory response
by Tregs.

An important fraction of microbial diversity is harbored in strain individuality,
so identification of conspecific bacterial strains is imperative for improved
understanding of microbial community functions. Limitations in bioinformatics and
sequencing technologies have to date precluded strain identification owing to
difficulties in phasing short reads to faithfully recover the original
strain-level genotypes, which have highly similar sequences. We present
ConStrains, an open-source algorithm that identifies conspecific strains from
metagenomic sequence data and reconstructs the phylogeny of these strains in
microbial communities. The algorithm uses single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
patterns in a set of universal genes to infer within-species structures that
represent strains. Applying ConStrains to simulated and host-derived datasets
provides insights into microbial community dynamics.

Since its initial identification as one of the genes most highly upregulated upon
T-cell activation, osteopontin (or Eta-1, as it was designated then) has been
demonstrated to have many roles in the regulation of the immune response on
multiple levels. It contributes to the development of immune-mediated and
inflammatory diseases, and it regulates the host response to infection. In some
cases, the mechanisms of these effects have been elucidated, while other
mechanistic functions of the protein remain obscure. The protein itself makes
these analyses complex, since it binds to a series of different integrins, and in
addition to its classically secreted form, an intracellular form of osteopontin
has been identified, which participates in several aspects of immune regulation. 
In this review, we focus on the role of osteopontin in a series of immune-related
diseases, particularly those where significant advances have been made in recent 
years: multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and related diseases,
Sjögren's disease, colitis, and 1 area of inflammatory pathology, alcoholic and
nonalcoholic liver diseases. A recurring theme in these diseases is a link
between osteopontin and pathogenic T cells, particularly T helper 17 cells, where
osteopontin produced by dendritic cells supports IL-17 expression, contributing
to pathology. In addition, a role for osteopontin in B-cell differentiation is
becoming clear. In general, osteopontin contributes to pathology in these
diseases, but there are examples where it has a protective role; deciphering the 
mechanisms underlying these differences and the specific receptors for
osteopontin will be a research challenge for the future. Aside from its newly
discovered role in the development of Sjögren's disease, the role of osteopontin 
in inflammatory conditions in the oral cavity is still poorly understood.
Elucidation of this role will be of interest.

Although some existing epidemiological observations and molecular experiments
suggested that brain disorders in the realm of psychiatry may be influenced by
immune dysregulation, the degree of genetic overlap between psychiatric disorders
and immune disorders has not been well established. We investigated this issue by
integrative analysis of genome-wide association studies of 18 complex human
traits/diseases (five psychiatric disorders, seven immune disorders, and others) 
and multiple genome-wide annotation resources (central nervous system genes,
immune-related expression-quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and DNase I hypertensive
sites from 98 cell lines). We detected pleiotropy in 24 of the 35
psychiatric-immune disorder pairs. The strongest pleiotropy was observed for
schizophrenia-rheumatoid arthritis with MHC region included in the analysis (p = 
3.9 x 10(-285), and schizophrenia-Crohn's disease with MHC region excluded (p =
1.1 x 10(-36). Significant enrichment (> 1.4 fold) of immune-related eQTL was
observed in four psychiatric disorders. Genomic regions responsible for
pleiotropy between psychiatric disorders and immune disorders were detected. The 
MHC region on chromosome 6 appears to be the most important with other regions,
such as cytoband 1p13.2, also playing significant roles in pleiotropy. We also
found that most alleles shared between schizophrenia and Crohn's disease have the
same effect direction, with similar trend found for other disorder pairs, such as
bipolar-Crohn's disease. Our results offer a novel bird's-eye view of the genetic
relationship and demonstrate strong evidence for pervasive pleiotropy between
psychiatric disorders and immune disorders. Our findings might open new routes
for prevention and treatment strategies for these disorders based on a new
appreciation of the importance of immunological mechanisms in mediating risk of
many psychiatric diseases.

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are characterized by chronic inflammation of
the intestinal tract associated with an imbalance of the intestinal microbiota.
Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are the most widely known types 
of IBD and have been the focus of attention due to their increasing incidence.
Recent studies have pointed out genes associated with IBD susceptibility that,
together with environment factors, may contribute to the outcome of the disease. 
In ulcerative colitis, there are several therapies available, depending on the
stage of the disease. Aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and cyclosporine are
used to treat mild, moderate, and severe disease, respectively. In Crohn's
disease, drug choices are dependent on both location and behavior of the disease.
Nowadays, advances in treatments for IBD have included biological therapies,
based mainly on monoclonal antibodies or fusion proteins, such as anti-TNF drugs.
Notwithstanding the high cost involved, these biological therapies show a high
index of remission, enabling a significant reduction in cases of surgery and
hospitalization. Furthermore, migration inhibitors and new cytokine blockers are 
also a promising alternative for treating patients with IBD. In this review, an
analysis of literature data on biological treatments for IBD is approached, with 
the main focus on therapies based on emerging recombinant biomolecules.

Substantial proportion of Crohn's disease (CD) patients shows no response or a
limited response to treatment with infliximab (IFX) and to identify biomarkers of
response would be of great clinical and economic benefit. The expression profile 
of five genes (S100A8-S100A9, G0S2, TNFAIP6, and IL11) reportedly predicted
response to IFX and we aimed at investigating their etiologic role through
genetic association analysis. Patients with active CD (350) who received at least
three induction doses of IFX were included and classified according to IFX
response. A tagging strategy was used to select genetic polymorphisms that cover 
the variability present in the chromosomal regions encoding the identified genes 
with altered expression. Following genotyping, differences between responders and
nonresponders to IFX were observed in haplotypes of the studied regions:
S100A8-S100A9 (rs11205276* G/rs3014866* C/rs724781* C/rs3006488* A; P = 0.05);
G0S2 (rs4844486* A/rs1473683* T; P = 0.15); TNFAIP6 (rs11677200* C/rs2342910*
A/rs3755480* G/rs10432475* A; P = 0.10); and IL11 (rs1126760* C/rs1042506* G; P =
0.07). These differences were amplified in patients with colonic and ileocolonic 
location for all but the TNFAIP6 haplotype, which evidenced significant
difference in ileal CD patients. Our results support the role of the reported
expression signature as predictive of anti-TNF outcome in CD patients and suggest
an etiological role of those top-five genes in the IFX response pathway.

Th17 response and autophagy--main pathways implicated in the development of
inflammatory bowel disease by genome-wide association studies.

Díaz Peña R, Valdés E, Cofré C, Castro-Santos P.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an entity that mainly includes ulcerative
colitis (UC) and Crohn´s disease (CD). Improved health care, diet changes, and
higher industrialization are associated with an increase in IBD prevalence. This 
supports the central role of environmental factors in the pathology of this
disease. However, IBD also shows a relevant genetic component as shown by high
heritability. Classic genetic studies showed relevant associations between IBD
susceptibility and genes involved in the immune response. This is consistent with
prior theories about IBD development. According to these, contact of the immune
system with a high number of harmless antigens from the diet and the bacterial
flora should originate tolerance while preserving response against pathogens.
Failure to achieve this balance may originate the typical inflammatory response
associated with IBD. Recently, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have
confirmed the implication of the immune system, particularly the Th17 immune
response, previously associated to other autoimmune diseases, and of autophagy.
In this paper, the mechanisms involved in these two relevant pathways and their
potential role in the pathogenesis of IBD are reviewed.

BACKGROUND: Thiopurine-related toxicity results in discontinuation of therapy in 
up to 30% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Although thiopurine
S-methyltransferase (TPMT) is implicated in toxicity, not all toxicity can be
attributed to TPMT polymorphisms. We investigated the effects of polymorphisms of
genes involved in thiopurine and folate metabolism pathways on 6-thioguanine
nucleotide levels and toxicity.
METHODS: Retrospective clinical data and blood samples were collected from 132
pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with azathioprine.
Eighty-seven genetic polymorphisms of 30 genes were screened using the MassARRAY 
system, and 70 polymorphisms of 28 genes were selected for further analysis.
RESULTS: TPMT genotype (P < 0.001), concurrent use of mesalazine (P = 0.006),
ABCC5 (rs2293001) (P < 0.001), ITPA (rs2236206 and rs8362) (P = 0.010 and P =
0.003), and ABCB1 (rs2032582) (P = 0.028) were all associated with the ratio of
6-thioguanine nucleotides to azathioprine dose. ADK (rs10824095) (P = 0.004, odds
ratio [OR] = 6.220), SLC29A1 (rs747199) (P = 0.016, OR = 5.681), and TYMS
(rs34743033) (P = 0.045, OR = 3.846) were associated with neutropenia. ABCC1
(rs2074087) (P = 0.022, OR = 3.406), IMPDH1 (rs2278294) (P = 0.027, OR = 0.276), 
and IMPDH2 (rs11706052) (P = 0.034, OR = 3.639) had a significant impact on
lymphopenia.
CONCLUSIONS: This study describes genetic polymorphisms in genes whose products
may affect pharmacokinetics and which may predict the relative likelihood of
benefit or risk from thiopurine treatment. These findings may serve as a basis
for personalized thiopurine therapy in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel
disease, although our data need to be validated in further studies.

Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) is an inherited primary immunodeficiency
disease which increases the body's susceptibility to infections caused by certain
bacteria and fungi. CGD is a rare disease, caused by four genes, one type is 1X
linked and the other three are "autosomal recessive". Although clinical
presentation is variable, but characteristic features are recurrent pneumonia,
lymphadenitis, hepatic or other abscesses. Gastrointestinal tract symptoms are
common in x-linked recessive form of CGD. These include gastric and esophageal
obstruction and inflammatory bowel disease. GI involvement including small and
large intestines, the findings of luminal narrowing and the presence of granuloma
can make it difficult to distinguish from Crohn's disease. On the other hands
according to the literature ulcerative colitis is rarely reported in patients
with CGD. Our case presented with ulcerative colitis with CGD.

The human body is host to 100 trillion gut microbes, approximately 10-times more 
than all human cells. It is estimated that the approximately 500-1000 species
residing in the human gut encode 150-fold more unique genes than the human
genome. The gut microbiota has important functions in metabolic processing, such 
as energy production, immune cell development, food digestion, and epithelial
homeostasis. It has been increasingly recognized that a dysregulated gut
microbiome contributes in a significant way to a variety of diseases, including
diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, allergies, and inflammatory bowel
disease. In particular, accumulating evidence indicates that functional
interactions between the gut microbiome and xenobiotics play a role in mediating 
chemical toxicity and causing or exacerbating human disease. This review
summarizes emerging evidence that illustrates how xenobiotics can affect the gut 
microbiome structure, create functional changes to the gut microbiome, and become
biotransformed by the gut microbiome.

High levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor (TNF) have
been associated with many diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA),
ankylosing spondylitis (AS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and psoriasis.
Although it has been clear for twenty-five years that TNF plays a major role in
RA and AS, two major questions remain unanswered: (1) What mechanism underlies
the loss of control of TNF levels in patients? (2) How does TNF exert its
detrimental effects? Nonetheless, biological anti-TNF drugs have become the most 
successful treatment of these conditions with a third of patients entering
remission, and the global market for biological TNF inhibitors is now estimated
at around US$35 billions. However, their use is limited by their cost, the fact
that they need to be injected, non-negligible side effects and the development of
resistance due to the protein (thus antigenic) nature of these TNF inhibitors. It
looks inevitable that new approaches to lower the amount of TNF should be
considered. To do this, a better understanding of the regulation of TNF
expression is necessary.

We performed a meta-analysis to estimate whether combined evidence shows the
association between the MCP-1-2518A/G polymorphism and susceptibility to
autoimmune diseases. Relevant articles dated to July 2014 were acquired from the 
PubMed, EMBASE, ISI, and CNKI databases. The number of the genotypes and/or
alleles for the MCP-1-2518A/G in cases and control subjects was extracted, and
statistical analysis was conducted using STATA 11.2 software. Summary odds ratios
(ORs) with their 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) were used to calculate the 
risk of autoimmune diseases with the MCP-1-2518A/G. Significant increased risk of
autoimmune diseases could be found for A allele vs. G allele (OR = 1.616, 95 % CI
1.027-2.542, P = 0.038) and AA + AG vs. GG (OR = 1.616, 95 % CI 1.027-2.542,
P = 0.038) in Asian patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and for A allele vs.
G allele (OR = 1.383, 95 % CI 1.142-1.676, P = 0.022) and AA vs. AG + GG
(OR = 1.575, 95 % CI 1.361-1.823, P < 0.001) in European patients with Crohn's
disease (CD). In addition, when comparison of European patients with lupus
nephritis (LN) and without LN, significant association between patients with LN
and without LN also could be found for AA vs. AG + GG (OR = 0.713, 95 % CI
0.545-0.933, P = 0.014). This meta-analysis showed that the MCP-1-2518-A allele
confers susceptibility to Asian patients with RA and European patients with CD.

To date, three Entamoeba spp. (E. suis, zoonotic E. polecki and E. histolytica)
have been identified in pigs, but their pathogenicity and molecular
classification have not been fully determined. Examination and pathological
analysis of pigs (n=3) with diarrhoea was conducted and revealed the presence of 
Entamoeba organisms. We performed a genetic analysis of the isolate using the
small-subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene region to identify the species. A
severe ulcerative colitis was observed histopathologically with inflammatory
cells, including macrophages and neutrophils, infiltrating the mucous membranes
of the cecum and colon. Many Entamoeba trophozoites were found at the erosion
site or at ulcerative lesions. Pathogenic viruses or bacteria were not detected. 
The SSU rRNA sequence of the Entamoeba isolate was found to be completely
homologous to that of E. polecki subtype 3.

OBJECTIVE: Research on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has highlighted genes
involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses as contributors to disease
pathogenesis. This study aimed to evaluate the associations between IBD and
variations in NOD2, TLR4, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and IL-1RN genes, and to use the
genetic data obtained in predictive modeling.
METHODS: A total of 167 IBD patients and 101 healthy controls were genotyped by
polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Using the
genotype data attained as the input to various classification algorithms, IBD
prediction models were designed. The area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve (AUROC) was used to measure their performance.
RESULTS: Significant associations were found between Crohn's disease (CD) and
minor NOD2 variants, as well as TLR4 299Gly, TNF-α G-308A, IL-6 G-174C and IL-1RN
VNTR A2 variants, while ulcerative colitis (UC) was associated only with IL-1RN
VNTR A2 variants. CD and UC showed highly significant difference in the allelic
distribution of TNF-α G-308A, where the A allele was found to be related to CD,
and the G allele to UC. A combined effect of patients' gender and TLR4 variants
was observed among CD patients. When all analyzed genotype and gender data were
used, prediction performance achieved a maximum AUROC of 0.690 for CD and 0.601
for UC dataset.
CONCLUSION: Variations in the genes involved in immune regulation are genetic
factors of importance in IBD susceptibility that could potentially be used as
predictors of disease development.

Neurological complications of inflammatory bowel diseases (i.e., ulcerative
colitis and Crohn's disease) can be summarized as a combination of neuromuscular 
manifestations, cerebrovascular and demyelinating diseases that can be seen in
approximately 3% of patients. In addition, asymptomatic cerebral white matter
lesions may be detected in these patients. Clustering of diseases within families
may be explained by the exposure to similar environmental factors, shared genes, 
or complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors. Here we report
an epileptic patient with Crohn's disease and cerebral white matter lesions, a
family with ulcerative colitis and multiple sclerosis and two patients who have
both multiple sclerosis and Crohn's disease.

BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by a chronic
inflammation of the gut, partly driven by defects in the innate immune system.
Considering the central role of inflammasome signaling in innate immunity, we
studied inflammasome components in IBD mucosa.
METHODS: Expression of genes encoding inflammasome sensor subunits was
investigated in colonic mucosal biopsies from 2 cohorts of patients with IBD and 
controls.
RESULTS: A significant upregulation (>2-fold change in expression, false
discovery rate <0.05) of the PYHIN inflammasomes AIM2 and IFI16 in active IBD
versus controls was found. Also IFI16 was significantly increased in inactive IBD
versus controls. Moreover, responders to anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy
showed decreased expression of these inflammasomes although IFI16 remained
significantly increased in responders showing endoscopic healing versus controls.
AIM2 was mainly expressed in epithelial cells, whereas IFI16 was expressed in
both lymphocytes and epithelial cells. Functional activation of predominant
AIM2/IFI16-mediated inflammasomes in active IBD colon was shown by the presence
of the downstream effectors CASP1 and HMGB-1 in inflamed mucosa.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the importance of PYHIN inflammasome signaling
in IBD and also link anti-tumor necrosis factor responsiveness to inflammasome
signaling. Together, this points to the potential value of the inflammasome
pathway as a new therapeutic target for IBD treatment.

Anti-TNFα therapy, known to suppress T-cell immunity, is increasingly gaining
popularity for treatment of autoimmune diseases including inflammatory bowel
diseases (IBD). T-cell suppression increases the risk of B-cell
EBV-lymphoproliferative diseases and lymphomas. Since EBV-lytic activation is
essential for development of EBV-lymphomas and there have been reports of
EBV-lymphomas in patients treated with anti-TNFα therapy, we investigated if
patients treated with anti-TNFα antibodies demonstrate greater EBV-lytic activity
in blood. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 10 IBD patients solely on
anti-TNFα therapy compared to 3 control groups (10 IBD patients not on
immunosuppressive therapy, 10 patients with abdominal pain but without IBD, and
10 healthy subjects) were examined for the percentage of T-cells, EBV load and
EBV-lytic transcripts. Patients on anti-TNFα therapy had significantly fewer
T-cells, greater EBV load, and increased levels of transcripts from EBV-lytic
genes of all kinetic classes compared to controls. Furthermore, exposure of
EBV-infected B-cell lines to anti-TNFα antibodies resulted in increased levels of
BZLF1 mRNA; BZLF1 encodes for ZEBRA, the viral latency-to-lytic cycle switch.
Thus, IBD patients treated with anti-TNFα antibodies have greater EBV loads
likely due to enhanced EBV-lytic gene expression and anti-TNFα antibodies may be 
sufficient to activate the EBV lytic cycle. Findings from this pilot study lay
the groundwork for additional scientific and clinical investigation into the
effects of anti-TNFα therapy on the life cycle of EBV, a ubiquitous oncovirus
that causes lymphomas in the setting of immunocompromise.

Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed 11 independent risk loci for
polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common disorder in young women characterized 
by androgen excess and oligomenorrhea. To put these risk loci and the single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) therein into functional context, we measured DNA 
methylation and gene expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies to
identify PCOS-specific alterations. Two genes from the LHCGR region,
STON1-GTF2A1L and LHCGR, were overexpressed in PCOS. In analysis stratified by
obesity, LHCGR was overexpressed only in non-obese PCOS women. Although not
differentially expressed in the entire PCOS group, INSR was underexpressed in
obese PCOS subjects only. Alterations in gene expression in the LHCGR, RAB5B and 
INSR regions suggest that SNPs in these loci may be functional and could affect
gene expression directly or indirectly via epigenetic alterations. We identified 
reduced methylation in the LHCGR locus and increased methylation in the INSR
locus, changes that are concordant with the altered gene expression profiles.
Complex patterns of meQTL and eQTL were identified in these loci, suggesting that
local genetic variation plays an important role in gene regulation. We propose
that non-obese PCOS women possess significant alterations in LH receptor
expression, which drives excess androgen secretion from the ovary. Alternatively,
obese women with PCOS possess alterations in insulin receptor expression, with
underexpression in metabolic tissues and overexpression in the ovary, resulting
in peripheral insulin resistance and excess ovarian androgen production. These
studies provide a genetic and molecular basis for the reported clinical
heterogeneity of PCOS.

An imbalance in pro- and anti-inflammation is an important mechanism of steroid
resistance in UC (ulcerative colitis), and miRNAs may participate in this
process. The present study aimed to explore whether miRNAs play a role in the
steroid resistance of UC by regulating gene expression of the inflammation signal
pathway. SS (steroid-sensitive) patients, SR (steroid-resistant) patients and
healthy individuals were recruited. In vivo miRNA profiles of serum samples
showed that miR-195 was decreased significantly in the SR group compared with the
SS group (P<0.05). This result was confirmed by qPCR (quantitative real-time PCR)
and miRNA ISH (in situ hybridization) in serum and colon tissue samples. Online
software was used to identify Smad7 mRNA as a potential target of miR-195. The
direct interaction of miR-195 and Smad7 mRNA was investigated using a
biotinylated miR-195 pull-down assay. Overexpression of a miR-195 precursor
lowered cellular levels of Smad7 protein; conversely, antagonism of miR-195
enhanced Smad7 translation without disturbing Smad7 mRNA levels. A luciferase
reporter assay revealed a repressive effect of miR-195 via a single Smad7 3'-UTR 
target site, and point mutation of this site prevented miR-195-induced repression
of Smad7 translation. Furthermore, increased levels of miR-195 led to a decrease 
in c-Jun and p65 expression. In contrast, transfection with anti-miR-195 led to
increased levels of c-Jun and p65 protein. The decrease in miR-195 led to an
increase in Smad7 expression and corresponding up-regulation of p65 and the AP-1 
(activator protein 1) pathway, which might explain the mechanism of steroid
resistance in UC patients.

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified hundreds of
susceptibility genes, including shared associations across clinically distinct
autoimmune diseases. We performed an inverse χ(2) meta-analysis across ten
pediatric-age-of-onset autoimmune diseases (pAIDs) in a case-control study
including more than 6,035 cases and 10,718 shared population-based controls. We
identified 27 genome-wide significant loci associated with one or more pAIDs,
mapping to in silico-replicated autoimmune-associated genes (including IL2RA) and
new candidate loci with established immunoregulatory functions such as ADGRL2,
TENM3, ANKRD30A, ADCY7 and CD40LG. The pAID-associated single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) were functionally enriched for deoxyribonuclease
(DNase)-hypersensitivity sites, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs),
microRNA (miRNA)-binding sites and coding variants. We also identified
biologically correlated, pAID-associated candidate gene sets on the basis of
immune cell expression profiling and found evidence of genetic sharing. Network
and protein-interaction analyses demonstrated converging roles for the signaling 
pathways of type 1, 2 and 17 helper T cells (TH1, TH2 and TH17), JAK-STAT,
interferon and interleukin in multiple autoimmune diseases.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Defects in intestinal innate defense systems predispose
patients to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Reactive oxygen species (ROS)
generated by nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases in the 
mucosal barrier maintain gut homeostasis and defend against pathogenic attack. We
hypothesized that molecular genetic defects in intestinal NADPH oxidases might be
present in children with IBD.
METHODS: After targeted exome sequencing of epithelial NADPH oxidases NOX1 and
DUOX2 on 209 children with very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEOIBD), 
the identified mutations were validated using Sanger Sequencing. A structural
analysis of NOX1 and DUOX2 variants was performed by homology in silico modeling.
The functional characterization included ROS generation in model cell lines and
in in vivo transduced murine crypts, protein expression, intracellular
localization, and cell-based infection studies with the enteric pathogens
Campylobacter jejuni and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli.
RESULTS: We identified missense mutations in NOX1 (c.988G>A, p.Pro330Ser;
c.967G>A, p.Asp360Asn) and DUOX2 (c.4474G>A, p.Arg1211Cys; c.3631C>T,
p.Arg1492Cys) in 5 of 209 VEOIBD patients. The NOX1 p.Asp360Asn variant was
replicated in a male Ashkenazi Jewish ulcerative colitis cohort. All NOX1 and
DUOX2 variants showed reduced ROS production compared with wild-type enzymes.
Despite appropriate cellular localization and comparable pathogen-stimulated
translocation of altered oxidases, cells harboring NOX1 or DUOX2 variants had
defective host resistance to infection with C. jejuni.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies the first inactivating missense variants in
NOX1 and DUOX2 associated with VEOIBD. Defective ROS production from intestinal
epithelial cells constitutes a risk factor for developing VEOIBD.

Efficient acquisition of extracellular nutrients is essential for bacterial
pathogenesis, however the identities and mechanisms for transport of many of
these substrates remain unclear. Here, we investigate the predicted iron-binding 
transporter AfuABC and its role in bacterial pathogenesis in vivo. By
crystallographic, biophysical and in vivo approaches, we show that AfuABC is in
fact a cyclic hexose/heptose-phosphate transporter with high selectivity and
specificity for a set of ubiquitous metabolites (glucose-6-phosphate,
fructose-6-phosphate and sedoheptulose-7-phosphate). AfuABC is conserved across a
wide range of bacterial genera, including the enteric pathogens EHEC O157:H7 and 
its murine-specific relative Citrobacter rodentium, where it lies adjacent to
genes implicated in sugar sensing and acquisition. C. rodentium ΔafuA was
significantly impaired in an in vivo murine competitive assay as well as its
ability to transmit infection from an afflicted to a naïve murine host.
Sugar-phosphates were present in normal and infected intestinal mucus and stool
samples, indicating that these metabolites are available within the intestinal
lumen for enteric bacteria to import during infection. Our study shows that
AfuABC-dependent uptake of sugar-phosphates plays a critical role during enteric 
bacterial infection and uncovers previously unrecognized roles for these
metabolites as important contributors to successful pathogenesis.

Microarray analysis of promoter hypermethylation provides insight into the role
and extent of DNA methylation in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC) and
may be co-monitored with the appearance of driver mutations. Colonic biopsy
samples were obtained endoscopically from 10 normal, 23 adenoma (17 low-grade
(LGD) and 6 high-grade dysplasia (HGD)), and 8 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients
(4 active and 4 inactive). CRC samples were obtained from 24 patients (17
primary, 7 metastatic (MCRC)), 7 of them with synchronous LGD. Field effects were
analyzed in tissues 1 cm (n = 5) and 10 cm (n = 5) from the margin of CRC. Tissue
materials were studied for DNA methylation status using a 96 gene panel and for
KRAS and BRAF mutations. Expression levels were assayed using whole genomic mRNA 
arrays. SFRP1 was further examined by immunohistochemistry. HT29 cells were
treated with 5-aza-2' deoxycytidine to analyze the reversal possibility of DNA
methylation. More than 85% of tumor samples showed hypermethylation in 10 genes
(SFRP1, SST, BNC1, MAL, SLIT2, SFRP2, SLIT3, ALDH1A3, TMEFF2, WIF1), whereas the 
frequency of examined mutations were below 25%. These genes distinguished
precancerous and cancerous lesions from inflamed and healthy tissue. The mRNA
alterations that might be caused by systematic methylation could be partly
reversed by demethylation treatment. Systematic changes in methylation patterns
were observed early in CRC carcinogenesis, occuring in precursor lesions and CRC.
Thus we conclude that DNA hypermethylation is an early and systematic event in
colorectal carcinogenesis, and it could be potentially reversed by systematic
demethylation therapy, but it would need more in vitro and in vivo experiments to
support this theory.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Post-operative recurrence is frequent in Crohn's disease.
Genetic factors associated with post-operative recurrence remain poorly
understood. Identification of genetic variants associated with repeat surgery
would allow risk stratification of patients who may benefit from early aggressive
therapy and/or post-operative prophylactic treatment.
METHODS: Crohn's disease patients who had at least one bowel resection were
retrospectively identified from the "Nancy IBD cohort". Covariates and potential 
interactions were assessed using the Cox proportional hazard model. Kaplan-Meier 
curves for time to surgical recurrence were developed for 200 genetic variants
and analyzed with the log-rank test.
RESULTS: 137 patients had at least 1 resection in our cohort: 38 had a surgical
recurrence (28%). In multivariate analysis, current smoker status (OR 6.97, 95%
CI 1.85-26.22, p=0.004), post-operative complications after prior surgery (OR
2.72, 95% CI 1.02-7.22, p=0.044), and Caspase recruitment domain-containing
protein 8 (CARD8) homozygosity for the risk allele (OR 7.56, 95% CI 1.13-50.37,
p=0.036) remained significantly and independently associated with surgical
recurrence.
CONCLUSION: Current smoker status was associated with increased risk of surgical 
recurrence. A novel association between CARD8 and increased risk of surgical
recurrence in Crohn's disease was observed. CARD8 could be a new marker for risk 
stratification and prevention of recurrent surgery.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has familial aggregation in
African Americans (AAs), but little is known about the molecular genetic
susceptibility. Mapping studies using the Immunochip genotyping array expand the 
number of susceptibility loci for IBD in Caucasians to 163, but the contribution 
of the 163 loci and European admixture to IBD risk in AAs is unclear. We
performed a genetic mapping study using the Immunochip to determine whether IBD
susceptibility loci in Caucasians also affect risk in AAs and identify new
associated loci.
METHODS: We recruited AAs with IBD and without IBD (controls) from 34 IBD centers
in the United States; additional controls were collected from 4 other Immunochip 
studies. Association and admixture loci were mapped for 1088 patients with
Crohn's disease, 361 with ulcerative colitis, 62 with IBD type unknown, and 1797 
controls; 130,241 autosomal single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analyzed.
RESULTS: The strongest associations were observed between ulcerative colitis and 
HLA rs9271366 (P = 7.5 × 10(-6)), Crohn's disease and 5p13.1 rs4286721 (P = 3.5 ×
10(-6)), and IBD and KAT2A rs730086 (P = 2.3 × 10(-6)). Additional suggestive
associations (P < 4.2 × 10(-5)) were observed between Crohn's disease and IBD and
African-specific SNPs in STAT5A and STAT3; between IBD and SNPs in IL23R, IL12B, 
and C2orf43; and between ulcerative colitis and SNPs near HDAC11 and near
LINC00994. The latter 3 loci have not been previously associated with IBD, but
require replication. Established Caucasian associations were replicated in AAs (P
< 3.1 × 10(-4)) at NOD2, IL23R, 5p15.3, and IKZF3. Significant admixture (P < 3.9
× 10(-4)) was observed for 17q12-17q21.31 (IZKF3 through STAT3),
10q11.23-10q21.2, 15q22.2-15q23, and 16p12.2-16p12.1. Network analyses showed
significant enrichment (false discovery rate <1 × 10(-5)) in genes that encode
members of the JAK-STAT, cytokine, and chemokine signaling pathways, as well
those involved in pathogenesis of measles.
CONCLUSIONS: In a genetic analysis of 3308 AA IBD cases and controls, we found
that many variants associated with IBD in Caucasians also showed association
evidence with these diseases in AAs; we also found evidence for variants and loci
not previously associated with IBD. The complex genetic factors that determine
risk for or protection against IBD in different populations require further
study.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Dual oxidase 2 (DUOX2), a hydrogen-peroxide generator at the
apical membrane of gastrointestinal epithelia, is up-regulated in patients with
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) before the onset of inflammation, but little is 
known about its effects. We investigated the role of DUOX2 in maintaining mucosal
immune homeostasis in mice.
METHODS: We analyzed the regulation of DUOX2 in intestinal tissues of germ-free
vs conventional mice, mice given antibiotics or colonized with only segmented
filamentous bacteria, mice associated with human microbiota, and mice with
deficiencies in interleukin (IL) 23 and IL22 signaling. We performed 16S
ribosomal RNA gene quantitative polymerase chain reaction of intestinal mucosa
and mesenteric lymph nodes of Duoxa(-/-) mice that lack functional DUOX enzymes. 
Genes differentially expressed in Duoxa(-/-) mice compared with co-housed
wild-type littermates were correlated with gene expression changes in early-stage
IBD using gene set enrichment analysis.
RESULTS: Colonization of mice with segmented filamentous bacteria up-regulated
intestinal expression of DUOX2. DUOX2 regulated redox signaling within
mucosa-associated microbes and restricted bacterial access to lymphatic tissues
of the mice, thereby reducing microbiota-induced immune responses. Induction of
Duox2 transcription by microbial colonization did not require the mucosal
cytokines IL17 or IL22, although IL22 increased expression of Duox2. Dysbiotic,
but not healthy human microbiota, activated a DUOX2 response in recipient
germ-free mice that corresponded to abnormal colonization of the mucosa with
distinct populations of microbes. In Duoxa(-/-) mice, abnormalities in ileal
mucosal gene expression at homeostasis recapitulated those in patients with
mucosal dysbiosis.
CONCLUSIONS: DUOX2 regulates interactions between the intestinal microbiota and
the mucosa to maintain immune homeostasis in mice. Mucosal dysbiosis leads to
increased expression of DUOX2, which might be a marker of perturbed mucosal
homeostasis in patients with early-stage IBD.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an important risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC). 
Histone modifications are one of the epigenetic mechanisms that may have key
roles in the carcinogenesis of CRC. At present, there are no studies comparing
histone modification patterns of UC and CRC in the literature. Therefore the aim 
of the present study was to investigate whether genes, particularly those
involved in histone modification, have value in patient monitoring with regards
to CRC development in UC. Key gene expressions of the histone modification enzyme
were assessed and compared in CRC, UC and control groups using the RT-PCR array
technique. Patients were divided into subgroups based on the extent and duration 
of the disease and inflammatory burden, which are considered risk factors for CRC
development in UC patients. In UC and CRC groups, a significantly higher
overexpression of the NEK6 and AURKA genes compared to the control group was
identified. In addition, there was a significantly higher overexpression of HDAC1
and PAK1 genes in the UC group, and of HDAC1, HDAC7, PAK1 and AURKB genes in the 
CRC group. NEK6, AURKA, HDAC1 and PAK1 were significantly overexpressed in
patients with a longer UC duration. Overexpression of AURKA and NEK6 genes was
significantly more pronounced in UC patients with more extensive colon
involvement. HDAC1, HDAC7, PAK1, NEK6, AURKA and AURKB are important diagnostic
and prognostic markers involved in the carcinogenesis of CRC. HDAC1, PAK1, NEK6
and AURKA may be considered as diagnostic markers to be used in CRC screening for
UC patients.

In this review, we provide an update on genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In addition, we summarize progress in defining 
the functional consequences of associated alleles for coding and noncoding
genetic variation. In the small minority of loci where major association signals 
correspond to nonsynonymous variation, we summarize studies defining their
functional effects and implications for therapeutic targeting. Importantly, the
large majority of GWAS-associated loci involve noncoding variation, many of which
modulate levels of gene expression. Recent expression quantitative trait loci
(eQTL) studies have established that the expression of most human genes is
regulated by noncoding genetic variations. Significant advances in defining the
epigenetic landscape have demonstrated that IBD GWAS signals are highly enriched 
within cell-specific active enhancer marks. Studies in European ancestry
populations have dominated the landscape of IBD genetics studies, but
increasingly, studies in Asian and African-American populations are being
reported. Common variation accounts for only a modest fraction of the predicted
heritability and the role of rare genetic variation of higher effects (ie, odds
ratios markedly deviating from 1) is increasingly being identified through
sequencing efforts. These sequencing studies have been particularly productive in
more severe very early onset cases. A major challenge in IBD genetics will be
harnessing the vast array of genetic discovery for clinical utility through
emerging precision medical initiatives. In this article, we discuss the rapidly
evolving area of direct-to-consumer genetic testing and the current utility of
clinical exome sequencing, especially in very early onset, severe IBD cases. We
summarize recent progress in the pharmacogenetics of IBD with respect to
partitioning patient responses to anti-TNF and thiopurine therapies. Highly
collaborative studies across research centers and across subspecialties and
disciplines will be required to fully realize the promise of genetic discovery in
IBD.

Cardamonin is a naturally occurring chalcone with strong anti-inflammatory
activity. However, the direct effect of cardamonin on intestinal inflammation
remains elusive. In the present study, we found that cardamonin markedly
ameliorated dextran sulfate sodium-induced mouse body weight loss, diarrhea,
colon shortening, spleen swelling, and histological damage, which correlated with
a decline in the activity of myeloperoxidase and the production of nitric oxide, 
tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 in the colon. The upregulation of
toll-like receptor 4 after dextran sulfate sodium treatment was associated with
an increase in the activation of myeloid differentiation factor 88, interleukin-1
receptor-associated kinase-1, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65, inhibitor κBα, and
inhibitor κB kinase-α/β, as well as the mitogen-activated protein kinase
molecules of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase,
and this upregulation was reversed by cardamonin administration. Moreover,
cardamonin blocked the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65, inhibited
NF-κB-luciferase activity, and downregulated NF-κB target genes expression. The
present study clearly demonstrates a beneficial effect of cardamonin on
experimental inflammatory bowel disease via a mechanism associated with

With the endogenous formation of vitamin D being significantly curtailed because 
of public awareness of skin cancer dangers, attention is turning to dietary
sources. Cumulative evidence has implicated vitamin D deficiency in increasing
susceptibility to various gastrointestinal disorders, including colorectal
cancer, inflammatory bowel diseases, diverticulitis, and irritable bowel
syndrome. There is also reason to suggest adjunct vitamin D therapy for such
diseases. Although there is justification for increasing vitamin D intake
overall, optimal intakes will vary among individuals. Genomic technologies have
revealed several hundreds of genes associated with vitamin D actions. The nature 
of these genes emphasizes the potentially negative implications of modulating
vitamin D intakes in the absence of complementary human genetic and genomic data,
including information on the gut microbiome. However, we are not yet in a
position to apply this information. Genomic data (transcriptomics, metabolomics, 
proteomics, and metagenomics) could provide evidence that vitamin D sufficiency
has been achieved. We suggest that there is an increasingly strong case for
considering the more widespread use of vitamin D fortified foods and/or dietary
supplements to benefit gastrointestinal health. However, intake levels might
beneficially be informed by personalized genetic and genomic information, for
optimal disease prevention and maintenance of remission.

AIM: The aim of this study is to investigate whether TNF-α polymorphisms are
associated with the responsiveness to anti-TNF-α therapy in patients with
spondyloarthropathy, psoriasis, and Crohn's disease.
METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis on the association between the TNF-α
polymorphisms and responsiveness of patients.
RESULTS: The meta-analysis indicated an association between the TNF-α -308 G
allele (OR = 2.005; 95% CI: 1.417-2.838; p = 8.6 × 10(-5)), TNF-α -238 G allele
(OR = 2.196; 95% CI: 1161-4.154; p = 0.016), and TNF-α -857 C allele (OR = 1.779;
95% CI: 1.130-2.802; p = 0.013) and response to TNF-α blockers in Caucasians.
CONCLUSION: Individuals carrying the TNF-α -308 G, -238 G, or -857 C common
alleles show better responses to TNF-α blockers than those with minor alleles in 
Caucasians.

Genetic factors play a significant role in determining inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD) susceptibility. Epidemiologic data support genetic contribution to the
pathogenesis of IBD, which include familial aggregation, twin studies, and racial
and ethnic differences in disease prevalence. Recently, several new genes have
been identified to be involved in the genetic susceptibility to IBD. The
characterization of novel genes potentially will lead to the identification of
therapeutic agents and clinical assessment of phenotype and prognosis in patients
with IBD. The development of genetic markers associated with clinical outcomes in
patients with IBD will be very important in the future. The progress of molecular
biology tools (microarrays, proteomics, and epigenetics) have progressed the
field of the genetic markers discovery. The advances in bioinformatics coupled
with cross-disciplinary collaborations have greatly enhanced our ability to
retrieve, characterize, and analyze large amounts of data generated by the
technological advances. The techniques available for markers development are
genomics (single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping, pharmacogenetics, and gene
expression analyses) and proteomics. This could be a potential great benefit in
predicting the course of disease in individual patients and in guiding
appropriate medical therapy.

BACKGROUND: The accuracy and utility of electronic health record (EHR)-derived
phenotypes in replicating genotype-phenotype relationships have been infrequently
examined. Low circulating vitamin D levels are associated with severe outcomes in
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however, the genetic basis for vitamin D
insufficiency in this population has not been examined previously.
METHODS: We compared the accuracy of physician-assigned phenotypes in a large
prospective IBD registry to that identified by an EHR algorithm incorporating
codified and structured data. Genotyping for IBD risk alleles was performed on
the Immunochip and a genetic risk score calculated and compared between
EHR-defined patients and those in the registry. Additionally, 4 vitamin D risk
alleles were genotyped and serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D] levels compared
across genotypes.
RESULTS: A total of 1131 patients captured by our EHR algorithm were also
included in our prospective registry (656 Crohn's disease, 475 ulcerative
colitis). The overall genetic risk score for Crohn's disease (P = 0.13) and
ulcerative colitis (P = 0.32) was similar between EHR-defined patients and a
prospective registry. Three of the 4 vitamin D risk alleles were associated with 
low vitamin D levels in patients with IBD and contributed an additional 3% of the
variance explained. Vitamin D genetic risk score did not predict normalization of
vitamin D levels.
CONCLUSIONS: EHR cohorts form valuable data sources for examining
genotype-phenotype relationships. Vitamin D risk alleles explain 3% of the
variance in vitamin D levels in patients with IBD.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by dysregulated host:microbial 
interactions and cytokine production. Host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs)
are critical in regulating these interactions. Multiple genetic loci are
associated with IBD, but altered functions for most, including in the rs713875
MTMR3/HORMAD2/LIF/OSM region, are unknown. We identified a previously undefined
role for myotubularin-related protein 3 (MTMR3) in amplifying PRR-induced
cytokine secretion in human macrophages and defined MTMR3-initiated mechanisms
contributing to this amplification. MTMR3 decreased PRR-induced
phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) and autophagy levels, thereby
increasing PRR-induced caspase-1 activation, autocrine IL-1β secretion, NFκB
signaling, and, ultimately, overall cytokine secretion. This MTMR3-mediated
regulation required the N-terminal pleckstrin homology-GRAM domain and Cys413
within the phosphatase domain of MTMR3. In MTMR3-deficient macrophages, reducing 
the enhanced autophagy or restoring NFκB signaling rescued PRR-induced cytokines.
Macrophages from rs713875 CC IBD risk carriers demonstrated increased MTMR3
expression and, in turn, decreased PRR-induced PtdIns3P and autophagy and
increased PRR-induced caspase-1 activation, signaling, and cytokine secretion.
Thus, the rs713875 IBD risk polymorphism increases MTMR3 expression, which
modulates PRR-induced outcomes, ultimately leading to enhanced PRR-induced
cytokines.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a well‑recognized complication of ulcerative colitis
(UC), and patients with UC have a higher incidence of CRC, compared with the
general population. However, the properties of CRC induced by UC have not been
clarified using an interaction network to analyze and compare gene sets. In the
present study, six microarray datasets of CRC and UC were extracted from the
Array Express database, and gene signatures were identified using the genome‑wide
relative significance (GWRS) method. Functional analysis was performed based on
the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. Prediction of the
genes and microRNA were performed using a hypergeometric method. A
protein‑protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the Search Tool
for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/proteins, and clusters were obtained
through the Molecular Complex Detection algorithm. Topological centrality and a
novel analyzing method, based on the rank value of GWGS, were used to
characterize the biological importance of the clusters. A total of 217
differentially expressed (DE) genes of CRC were identified, 341 DE genes were
identified in UC, and 62 common genes existed in the two. Several KEGG pathways
were the same in CRC and UC. Collagenase, progesterone, heparin, urokinase, nadh 
and adenosine drugs demonstrated potential for use in treatment of CRC and UC. In
the PPI network of CRC, 210 nodes and 752 edges were observed, wheras 314 nodes
and 882 edges were identified in UC. Cluster 3 in UC had the highest GWGS, while 
the topological centrality of Cluster 3 in UC had the lowest degree and
betweenness. PPI network analysis provided an effective way to estimate and
understand the likelihood of the potential connections between proteins/genes.
The results obtained following the use of GWGS to analyze differences between
clusters did not agree with the topological degree and betweenness centrality,
which indicated that gene fold change based GWGS was controversial with degree
here in CRC and UC.

Pregnane X receptor (PXR; NR1I2) is a member of the superfamily of nuclear
receptors that regulates the expression of genes involved in various biological
processes, including drug transport and biotransformation. In the present study, 
we investigated the effect of 3-hydroxyflavone and its structurally-related
analogues on PXR activity. 3-Hydroxyflavone, galangin, kaempferol, querceetin,
isorhamnetin, and tamarixetin, but not but not datiscetin, morin, myricetin, or
syringetin, activated mouse PXR, as assessed in a cell-based reporter gene assay.
By comparison, 3-hydroxyflavone activated rat PXR, whereas 3-hydroxyflavone,
galangin, quercetin, isorhamnetin, and tamarixetin activated human PXR (hPXR). A 
time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer competitive ligand-binding
assay showed binding to the ligand-binding domain of hPXR by 3-hydroxyflavone,
galangin, quercetin, isorhamnetin, and tamarixetin. 3-Hydroxyflavone and
galangin, but not quercetin, isorhamnetin, or tamarixetin, recruited steroid
receptor coactivator (SRC)-1, SRC-2, and SRC-3 to hPXR. In LS180 human colon
adenocarcinoma cells, 3-hydroxyflavone, quercetin, and tamarixetin increased
CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and ABCB1 mRNA expression, whereas galangin and isorhamnetin
increased CYP3A4 and ABCB1 but not CYP3A5 mRNA expression. Datiscetin,
kaempferol, morin, myricetin, and syringetin did not attenuate the extent of hPXR
activation by rifampicin, suggesting they are not hPXR antagonists. Overall,
flavonols activate PXR in an analogue-specific and species-dependent manner.
Substitution at the C2' or C5' position of 3-hydroxyflavone with a hydroxyl or
methoxy group rendered it incapable of activating hPXR. Understanding the
structure-activity relationship of flavonols in hPXR activation may facilitate
nutraceutical development efforts in the treatment of PXR-associated intestinal
diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease.

Mucosal immunity protects a host from intestinal inflammation and infection and
is profoundly influenced by symbiotic bacteria. Here we report that in mice
symbiotic bacteria directed selective cargo sorting in Paneth cells to promote
symbiosis through Nod2, a cytosolic bacterial sensor, and the multifunctional
protein kinase LRRK2, both encoded by inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-associated
genes. Commensals recruited Nod2 onto lysozyme-containing dense core vesicles
(DCVs), which was required for DCV localization of LRRK2 and a small GTPase,
Rab2a. Deficiency of Nod2, LRRK2 or Rab2a or depletion of commensals resulted in 
lysosomal degradation of lysozyme. Thus, commensal bacteria and host factors
orchestrate the lysozyme-sorting process to protect the host from enteric
infection, implicating Paneth cell dysfunction in IBD pathogenesis.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were reported to accelerate the curing of
ulcerative colitis (UC). Altered expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) has recently
revealed association with UC. However, the effect of adipose-derived MSCs (ASCs) 
on UC and the mechanism of how miRNAs regulate UC remain unclear. We investigated
the effect of ASCs on 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced UC in rat
colon tissues. qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence analyses were performed to monitor 
the expression of miR-1236 and its target molecule, retinoid-related orphan
receptor γ (RORγ). Regulation of the expression of RORγ by miR-1236 was assessed 
using luciferase reporter construct assays and miR-1236 mimic transfection. The
relationship between miR-1236 and RORγ was further investigated in HT29 cells
induced by TNF-α. ASCs highly ameliorated UC and decreased the inflammation
markers in rats with TNBS-induced UC. In addition, ASCs upregulated the
expression of miR-1236 and decreased the expression of RORγ in the TNBS-induced
rat model of UC. The luciferase reporter assay and bioinformatic analysis
demonstrated that the expression of RORγ was directly targeted and regulated by
miR-1236. Specifically, the expression of RORγ was suppressed by miR-1236 mimic
and enhanced by miR-1236 inhibitor. Furthermore, we demonstrated that exogenous
miR-1236 mimic could inhibit the expression of RORγ in HT29 cell induced by
TNF-α. ASCs effectively alleviated UC in rats with the expression of miR-1236
alteration, and miR-1236 may play important roles in UC by downregulating the
expression of RORγ.

Thirteen common susceptibility loci have been reproducibly associated with
cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM). We report the results of an international
2-stage meta-analysis of CMM genome-wide association studies (GWAS). This
meta-analysis combines 11 GWAS (5 previously unpublished) and a further three
stage 2 data sets, totaling 15,990 CMM cases and 26,409 controls. Five loci not
previously associated with CMM risk reached genome-wide significance (P < 5 ×
10(-8)), as did 2 previously reported but unreplicated loci and all 13
established loci. Newly associated SNPs fall within putative melanocyte
regulatory elements, and bioinformatic and expression quantitative trait locus
(eQTL) data highlight candidate genes in the associated regions, including one
involved in telomere biology.

Genome-wide association studies have provided many genetic alterations,
conferring susceptibility to multifactorial polygenic diseases, such as
inflammatory bowel diseases. Yet, how specific genetic alterations functionally
affect intestinal inflammation often remains elusive. It is noteworthy that a
large overlap of genes involved in immune deficiencies with those conferring
inflammatory bowel disease risk has been noted. This has provided new arguments
for the debate on whether inflammatory bowel disease arises from either an excess
or a deficiency in the immune system. In this review, we highlight the functional
effect of an inflammatory bowel disease-risk allele, which cannot be deduced from
genome-wide association studies data alone. As exemplified by the transcription
factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), we show that a
single gene can have a plethora of effects in various cell types of the gut.
These effects may individually contribute to the restoration of intestinal
homeostasis on the one hand or pave the way for excessive immunopathology on the 
other, as an inflammatory "rheo-STAT".

Crohn's disease (CD) is a polygenic immune-mediated disease characterized by
gastrointestinal inflammation. Mice deficient in the hematopoietic-restricted SH2
domain-containing inositolpolyphosphate 5'-phosphatase (SHIP) develop spontaneous
CD-like ileal inflammation. Intriguingly, SHIP mRNA is not upregulated in
biopsies from patients with ileal CD despite immune cell infiltration, but SHIP's
role in human CD remains unknown. We analyzed SHIP mRNA expression and activity
in biopsies and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from control and
treatment-naive subjects with ileal CD, and demonstrated that SHIP mRNA and
activity were lower in hematopoietic cells in ileal biopsies and PBMCs from
subjects with CD. In all tissues from our patient cohort and in PBMCs from a
second healthy control cohort, subjects homozygous for the autophagy-related
16-like protein (ATG16L1) CD-associated gene variant (rs2241880), had low SHIP
mRNA expression and activity. SHIP protein expression increased during autophagy 
and SHIP upregulation was dependent on ATG16L1 and/or autophagy, as well as the
ATG16L1 CD-associated gene variant. Finally, homozygosity for the ATG16L1 risk
variant and low SHIP mRNA expression is inversely related to increased
(LPS+ATP)-induced IL-1β production by PBMCs in our cohorts and was regulated by
increased transcription of ILIB. These data suggest a novel mechanism by which
the ATG16L1 CD-associated gene variant may predispose people to develop
intestinal inflammation.

Up to 100 trillion bacteria are harbored in the human intestine with a
mutualistic and interdependent relationship with the host during a long period of
co-evolution. The so-called intestinal microbiota (IM) fulfill important
metabolic tasks and the impaired stability may lead to IM-related diseases,
including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), colorectal cancer (CRC), metabolic
syndrome (MS), liver diseases, and so on. Here, we review the past and
development of IM research in China, including the achievements that Chinese
researchers have made both in basic and clinical scientific field. Moreover, we
evaluate the contributions of the National Natural Science Foundation of China
(NSFC), the 973 National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program), the 863
National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program),
and funds from the public health industry in the field of IM research.

The composition of the microbiome in health and disease has only recently become 
a major research focus. Although it is clear that an imbalance or dysbiosis in
the microbiota is associated with disease, its interrelatedness to disease
penetrance is largely unknown. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an excellent
disease in which to explore these questions because of the extensive genetic
studies identifying disease susceptibility loci and the ability to easily sample 
the intestinal microbiota in IBD patients due to the accessibility of stool
samples. In addition, mouse models of IBD have contributed to our understanding
of the interrelatedness of the gut microbiota and genes associated with IBD. The 
power of the mouse studies is that multiple colitis models exist that can be used
in combination with genetically modified mice that harbour deficiencies in IBD
susceptibility genes. Collectively, these studies revealed that bacterial
dysbiosis does occur in human IBD and in mouse colitis models. In addition, with 
an emphasis on immune genes, the mouse studies provided evidence that specific
immune regulatory proteins associated with IBD influence the gut microbiota in a 
manner consistent with disease penetrance. In this review, we will discuss
studies in both humans and mice that demonstrate the impact of immunodeficiences 
in interleukin-10, interleukin-17, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain
(NOD) 2, NOD-like receptor proteins 3 and 6, Toll-like receptor or IgA have on
the interrelatedness between the composition of the gut microbiota and disease
penetrance of IBD and its mouse models.

Maintaining the redox balance between generation and elimination of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) is critical for health. Disturbances such as continuously
elevated ROS levels will result in oxidative stress and development of disease,
but likewise, insufficient ROS production will be detrimental to health. Reduced 
or even complete loss of ROS generation originates mainly from inactivating
variants in genes encoding for NADPH oxidase complexes. In particular, deficiency
in phagocyte Nox2 oxidase function due to genetic variants (CYBB, CYBA, NCF1,
NCF2, NCF4) has been recognized as a direct cause of chronic granulomatous
disease (CGD), an inherited immune disorder. More recently, additional diseases
have been linked to functionally altered variants in genes encoding for other
NADPH oxidases, such as for DUOX2/DUOXA2 in congenital hypothyroidism, or for the
Nox2 complex, NOX1 and DUOX2 as risk factors for inflammatory bowel disease. A
comprehensive overview of novel developments in terms of Nox/Duox-deficiency
disorders is presented, combined with insights gained from structure-function
studies that will aid in predicting functional defects of clinical variants.

BACKGROUND: Genetic variation can alter transcriptional regulatory activity
contributing to variation in complex traits and risk of disease, but identifying 
individual variants that affect regulatory activity has been challenging.
Quantitative sequence-based experiments such as ChIP-seq and DNase-seq can detect
sites of allelic imbalance where alleles contribute disproportionately to the
overall signal suggesting allelic differences in regulatory activity.
METHODS: We created an allelic imbalance detection pipeline, AA-ALIGNER, to
remove reference mapping biases influencing allelic imbalance detection and
evaluate accuracy of allelic imbalance predictions in the absence of complete
genotype data. Using the sequence aligner, GSNAP, and varying amounts of genotype
information to remove mapping biases we investigated the accuracy of allelic
imbalance detection (binomial test) in CREB1 ChIP-seq reads from the GM12878 cell
line. Additionally we thoroughly evaluated the influence of experimental and
analytical parameters on imbalance detection.
RESULTS: Compared to imbalances identified using complete genotypes, using
imputed partial sample genotypes, AA-ALIGNER detected >95 % of imbalances with
>90 % accuracy. AA-ALIGNER performed nearly as well using common variants when
genotypes were unknown. In contrast, predicting additional heterozygous sites and
imbalances using the sequence data led to >50 % false positive rates. We
evaluated effects of experimental data characteristics and key analytical
parameter settings on imbalance detection. Overall, total base coverage and
signal dispersion across the genome most affected our ability to detect
imbalances, while parameters such as imbalance significance, imputation quality
thresholds, and alignment mismatches had little effect. To assess the biological 
relevance of imbalance predictions, we used electrophoretic mobility shift assays
to functionally test for predicted allelic differences in CREB1 binding in the
GM12878 lymphoblast cell line. Six of nine tested variants exhibited allelic
differences in binding. Two of these variants, rs2382818 and rs713875, are
located within inflammatory bowel disease-associated loci.
CONCLUSIONS: AA-ALIGNER accurately detects allelic imbalance in quantitative
sequence data using partial genotypes or common variants filling a critical
methodological gap in these analyses, as full genotypes are rarely available.
Importantly, we demonstrate how experimental and analytical features impact
imbalance detection providing guidance for similar future studies.

We examined the modulatory activity of β-caryophyllene (CA) and gene expression
in colitic colon tissues in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model.
Experimental colitis was induced by exposing male BALB/c mice to 5% DSS in
drinking water for 7 days. CA (30 or 300 mg/kg) was administered orally once a
day together with DSS. CA administration attenuated the increases in the disease 
activity index, colon weight/length ratio, inflammation score, and
myeloperoxidase activity in DSS-treated mice. Microarray analysis showed that CA 
administration regulated the expression in colon tissue of inflammation-related
genes including those for cytokines and chemokines (Ccl2, Ccl7, Ccl11, Ifitm3,
IL-1β, IL-28, Tnfrsf1b, Tnfrsf12a); acute-phase proteins (S100a8, Saa3, Hp);
adhesion molecules (Cd14, Cd55, Cd68, Mmp3, Mmp10, Sema6b, Sema7a, Anax13); and
signal regulatory proteins induced by DSS. CA significantly suppressed NF-κB
activity, which mediates the expression of a different set of genes. These
results suggest that CA attenuates DSS-induced colitis, possibly by modulating
the expression of genes associated mainly with colon inflammation through
inhibition of DSS-induced NF-κB activity.

INTRODUCTION: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease in which
cytokines play a pivotal role in the induction and maintenance of inflammation.
Innate cytokine production is genetically determined and varies largely between
individuals; this might impact the severity of inflammation. We aimed to assess
whether ex-vivo endotoxin-stimulated levels of cytokines could be associated with
disease phenotype.
METHODS: Patients with quiescent CD (Harvey-Bradshaw Index ≤ 4 and negative
inflammation markers) who were not using immunomodulating drugs or biologicals
were eligible. Historical disease characteristics (localization, behavior, number
of bowel resections, drug history, extra-intestinal symptoms) were extracted from
medical records. We measured cytokine levels (tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α,
interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and IL-10) in supernatants of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 
-stimulated whole blood cultures and correlated these with disease
characteristics and age- and sex-matched healthy controls. In addition, we
analyzed whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region of
the TNF-α gene were related to TNF-α levels.
RESULTS: We included 75 patients with CD and 24 healthy controls. Six patients
were excluded because of increased inflammation markers resulting in a total of
69 patients. The mean age (SD) of patients with CD was 51.2 (12.3) years with a
mean (SD) disease duration of 24.1 (11.5) years. Disease localization, peri-anal 
involvement and behavior were not related to LPS-stimulated TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 or
IL-10 levels. In addition, combination of localization with behavior to
differentiate mild from severe disease type showed no significant differences.
TNF-α levels were higher in patients with CD (428 pg/ml IQR [267-468]) compared
to healthy controls (459 pg/ml IQR [364-570], p=0.02). We found no associations
between SNPs in the promoter region and TNF-α levels.
CONCLUSION: In this study, innate cytokine production of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and
IL-10 was not related to historical disease characteristics or disease severity
in patients with quiescent CD. These findings suggest that genetically determined
levels of these cytokines obtained from LPS-stimulated whole blood cultures are
not linked with disease behavior or severity.

The pH-sensing receptor ovarian cancer G protein-coupled receptor 1 (OGR1; GPR68)
is expressed in the gut. Inflammatory bowel disease is typically associated with 
a decrease in local pH, which may lead to altered epithelial barrier function and
subsequent gastrointestinal repair involving epithelial cell adhesion and
migration. As the mechanisms underlying the response to pH changes are not well
understood, we have investigated OGR1-mediated, pH-dependent signaling pathways
in intestinal epithelial cells. Caco-2 cells stably overexpressing OGR1 were
created and validated as tools to study OGR1 signaling. Barrier function,
migration, and proliferation were measured using electric cell-substrate
impedance-sensing technology. Localization of the tight junction proteins zonula 
occludens protein 1 and occludin and the rearrangement of cytoskeletal actin were
examined by confocal microscopy. Paracellular permeability and protein and gene
expression analysis using DNA microarrays were performed on filter-grown Caco-2
monolayers. We report that an acidic pH shift from pH 7.8 to 6.6 improved barrier
function and stimulated reorganization of filamentous actin with prominent basal 
stress fiber formation. Cell migration and proliferation during in vitro wound
healing were inhibited. Gene expression analysis revealed significant
upregulation of genes related to cytoskeleton remodeling, cell adhesion, and
growth factor signaling. We conclude that acidic extracellular pH can have a
signaling function and impact the physiology of intestinal epithelial cells. The 
deconstruction of OGR1-dependent signaling may aid our understanding of mucosal
inflammation mechanisms.

Hypoxia is a hallmark of chronically inflamed tissue. Hypoxia develops from
vascular dysfunction and increased oxygen consumption by infiltrating leukocytes.
With respect to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), hypoxia is likely to be of
particular importance: Impairment of the intestinal barrier during IBD allows
anoxia from the lumen of the gut to spread to formerly normoxic tissue. In
addition, disturbed perfusion of inflamed tissue and a higher oxygen demand of
infiltrating immune cells lead to low oxygen levels in inflamed mucosal tissue.
Here, cells become hypoxic and must now adapt to this condition. The hypoxia
inducible factor (HIF)-1 complex is a key transcription factor for cellular
adaption to low oxygen tension. HIF-1 is a heterodimer formed by two subunits:
HIF-α (either HIF-1α or HIF-2α) and HIF-1β. Under normoxic conditions,
hydroxylation of the HIF-α subunit by specific oxygen-dependent prolyl
hydroxylases (PHDs) leads to ubiquitin proteasome-dependent degradation. Under
hypoxic conditions, however, PHD activity is inhibited; thus, HIF-α can
translocate into the nucleus, dimerize with HIF-1β, and bind to
hypoxia-responsive elements of HIF-1 target genes. So far, most studies have
addressed the function of HIF-1α in intestinal epithelial cells and the effect of
HIF stabilization by PHD inhibitors in murine models of colitis. Furthermore, the
role of HIF-1α in immune cells becomes more and more important as T cells or
dendritic cells for which HIF-1 is of critical importance are highly involved in 
the pathogenesis of IBD. This review will summarize the function of HIF-1α and
the therapeutic prospects for targeting the HIF pathway in intestinal mucosal
inflammation.

Rifaximin is a broad-spectrum oral antibiotic, exhibiting limited systemic
absorption, that is used clinically to treat a variety of gastrointestinal
disorders, including traveller's diarrhea, hepatic encephalopathy, irritable
bowel syndrome, and the inflammatory bowel diseases. Rifaximin's antimicrobial
properties, in the context of enteric infections, and its effects on the host's
intestinal microbiota have been well characterized. More recently, it has been
reported that rifaximin can modulate host tissue function through the activation 
of distinct molecular events. Within the gastrointestinal tract, rifaximin is a
selective agonist of the pregnane X receptor (PXR), a nuclear receptor that
regulates the expression of genes related to xenobiotic metabolism and drug
detoxification. The PXR can also elicit immunomodulatory effects through its
interaction with a variety of intracellular signaling cascades, including the
nuclear factor kappa B and c-jun N-terminal kinase pathways. In this review, we
will summarize the clinical uses of rifaximin and discuss its mechanism of action
in relation to the modulation of the intestinal microbiota and the regulation of 
gastrointestinal host cell function, with a specific focus on PXR-dependent
pathways.

BACKGROUND: Over the last decade, a massive amount of well-annotated genomic data
has been accumulated on the pathogenesis and therapies for ulcerative colitis
(UC). However, a comprehensive repository is not available yet.
METHODS: Ulcerative Colitis Database (UCDB) was constructed using text mining
followed by manually curating on the literature to collect the reliable
information of UC-related genes, drugs, and susceptibility loci. UC DNA
microarray data were collected. R packages were used to implement gene expression
analysis toolkit.
RESULTS: UCDB includes 4 separate but closely related components: "UC GENE," "UC 
DRUG," "UC LOCUS," and "UC ANALYSIS." The UC GENE contains comprehensive
information for 1151 UC-related genes manually curated from 2919 publications.
The UC DRUG includes information for 248 drugs manually curated from 2344
publications. "UC LOCUS" includes 110 UC susceptibility SNP loci, which were
collected from 12 Genome-Wide Association Studies. A comprehensive expression
quantitative trait loci browser was also implemented. The UC ANALYSIS is an
expression analysis toolkit for 37 UC expression array data sets, which contains 
1098 samples. The toolkit can be used to do gene expression correlation,
clustering, differentially expressed, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA).
CONCLUSIONS: UCDB provides a comprehensive collection of well-curated UC-related 
genes and drugs, and straightforward interfaces for gene expression analyses.
UCDB is a useful leading resource for both basic and clinical research and will
benefit UC community worldwide. UCDB is freely accessible at
http://seiwertlab.uchicago.edu/UCDB.

The phagocyte oxidative burst, mediated by Nox2 NADPH oxidase-derived reactive
oxygen species, confers host defense against a broad spectrum of bacterial and
fungal pathogens. Loss-of-function mutations that impair function of the Nox2
complex result in a life-threatening immunodeficiency, and genetic variants of
Nox2 subunits have been implicated in pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease 
(IBD). Thus, alterations in the oxidative burst can profoundly impact host
defense, yet little is known about regulatory mechanisms that fine-tune this
response. Here we report the discovery of regulatory nodes controlling oxidative 
burst by functional screening of genes within loci linked to human inflammatory
disease. Implementing a multi-omics approach, we define transcriptional,
metabolic and ubiquitin-cycling nodes controlled by Rbpj, Pfkl and Rnf145,
respectively. Furthermore, we implicate Rnf145 in proteostasis of the Nox2
complex by endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation. Consequently, ablation
of Rnf145 in murine macrophages enhances bacterial clearance, and rescues the
oxidative burst defects associated with Ncf4 haploinsufficiency.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD), IBD
diagnosed at 5 years of age or younger, frequently presents with a different and 
more severe phenotype than older-onset IBD. We investigated whether patients with
VEO-IBD carry rare or novel variants in genes associated with immunodeficiencies 
that might contribute to disease development.
METHODS: Patients with VEO-IBD and parents (when available) were recruited from
the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia from March 2013 through July 2014. We
analyzed DNA from 125 patients with VEO-IBD (age, 3 wk to 4 y) and 19 parents, 4 
of whom also had IBD. Exome capture was performed by Agilent SureSelect V4, and
sequencing was performed using the Illumina HiSeq platform. Alignment to human
genome GRCh37 was achieved followed by postprocessing and variant calling. After 
functional annotation, candidate variants were analyzed for change in protein
function, minor allele frequency less than 0.1%, and scaled combined
annotation-dependent depletion scores of 10 or less. We focused on genes
associated with primary immunodeficiencies and related pathways. An additional
210 exome samples from patients with pediatric IBD (n = 45) or adult-onset
Crohn's disease (n = 20) and healthy individuals (controls, n = 145) were
obtained from the University of Kiel, Germany, and used as control groups.
RESULTS: Four hundred genes and regions associated with primary immunodeficiency,
covering approximately 6500 coding exons totaling more than 1 Mbp of coding
sequence, were selected from the whole-exome data. Our analysis showed novel and 
rare variants within these genes that could contribute to the development of
VEO-IBD, including rare heterozygous missense variants in IL10RA and previously
unidentified variants in MSH5 and CD19.
CONCLUSIONS: In an exome sequence analysis of patients with VEO-IBD and their
parents, we identified variants in genes that regulate B- and T-cell functions
and could contribute to pathogenesis. Our analysis could lead to the
identification of previously unidentified IBD-associated variants.

Protective immunity against enteric parasitic nematodes is dependent on IL-4,
IL-13 activation of their exclusive transcription factor STAT6. The precise
pathways by which enteric parasitic nematodes are recognized by the host is
unclear, but elimination of this important interaction in developed nations is
thought to contribute to the dysregulated immune responses that are a
characteristic of autoimmune diseases. Nematode-derived products are involved in 
evading host defenses to promote their life cycle leading to modulation of host
immune responses. Host protective immunity has adapted to enteric parasitic
nematode infection by elaboration of mucins, increasing intraluminal fluid to
control access to the surface epithelium, increasing cell turnover to maintain an
effective barrier to their invasion, initiating immune responses through
activation of resident immune cells, and recruitment of additional immune cells
to release immune mediators that help orchestrate these responses. Both the
immune and functional outcomes depend largely on IL-4/IL-13 signaling through
STAT6, with a dominant role for IL-13 working through the type 2 IL-4 receptor
(IL-4R). The recent observation that enteric nematode infection prevents the
onset of a number of experimental models of IBD, diabetes, and several
extraintestinal autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis has generated
considerable interest in the identification of worm/egg products involved in the 
generation and maintenance of Th2 cytokines that may mediate the beneficial
effects of nematode infection in autoimmune and inflammatory pathologies.

A common feature of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is the loss of intestinal
epithelial barrier function due to excessive apoptosis of intestinal epithelial
cells (IECs). However, the molecular mechanism underlying increased IEC apoptosis
remains unclear. Here, we investigated the role of PHLPP, a novel family of
protein phosphatases, in regulating inflammation-induced IEC apoptosis in mouse
models of colitis. Both Phlpp1 and Phlpp2 genes were deleted in mice. Compared
with wild-type mice, PHLPP double knockout (DKO) mice were protected from colitis
induced by DSS as demonstrated by lower histopathological scores, and this
reduced susceptibility to colitis was associated with decreased apoptosis and
increased Akt activity in IECs in vivo. In addition, epithelial organoids derived
from PHLPP DKO mice were more resistant to inflammation-induced apoptosis while
inhibition of Akt activity abolished the protective effect of PHLPP-loss.
Furthermore, we found that PHLPP expression was significantly reduced in IECs
following the induction of colitis by DSS and in human IBD patient samples. This 
inflammation-induced downregulation of PHLPP was partially blocked by treating
cells with a proteasome inhibitor. Taken together, our results indicated that
proteasome-mediated degradation of PHLPP at the onset of inflammation plays an
important role in protecting IEC injury by inhibiting apoptosis.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a common inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) producing
intestinal inflammation and tissue damage. The precise aetiology of UC remains
unknown. In this study, we applied a rank-based expression profile comparative
algorithm, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), to evaluate the expression
profiles of UC patients and small interfering RNA (siRNA)-perturbed cells to
predict proteins that might be essential in UC from publicly available expression
profiles. We used quantitative PCR (qPCR) to characterize the expression levels
of those genes predicted to be the most important for UC in dextran sodium
sulphate (DSS)-induced colitic mice. We found that bromo-adjacent homology domain
(BAHD1), a novel heterochromatinization factor in vertebrates, was the most
downregulated gene. We further validated a potential role of BAHD1 as a
regulatory factor for inflammation through the TNF signalling pathway in vitro.
Our findings indicate that computational approaches leveraging public gene
expression data can be used to infer potential genes or proteins for diseases,
and BAHD1 might act as an indispensable factor in regulating the cellular
inflammatory response in UC.

Radiation proctitis is an insidious disease associated with substantial morbidity
and mortality. It may develop following the treatment of several cancers by
radiotherapy when normal colorectal tissues are present in the irradiation field.
There is no unified approach for the assessment and treatment of this disease,
partly due to insufficient knowledge about the mechanism involved in the
development of radiation proctitis. However, unresolved inflammation is
hypothesized to have an important role in late side effects. This study aimed to 
analyse the involvement of specific immunity in colorectal damage developing
after localized irradiation, and evaluate the benefit of immunomodulatory
mesenchymal stromal cells isolated from adipose tissue (Ad-MSCs) for reduction of
late side effects. Our experimental model of colorectal irradiation induced
severe colonic mucosal damage and fibrosis that was associated with T-cell
infiltration. Immune cell activation was investigated; adoptive transfer of T
cells in nude rats showed stronger colonization by T cells isolated from
irradiated rats. The predominant role of T cells in late radiation-induced damage
and regeneration processes was highlighted by in vivo depletion experiments.
Treatments using Ad-MSCs reduced T-cell infiltration in the colon and reduced
established colonic damage as measured by histological score, functional circular
muscle contractibility, and collagen deposition. Here, we have demonstrated for
the first time the predominance of the TH17 population compared to TH1 and TH2 in
radiation-induced bowel disease, and that this is reduced after Ad-MSC treatment.
Additionally, we demonstrated in vitro that IL17 acts directly on colonic smooth 
muscle cells to induce expression of pro-inflammatory genes that could
participate in the development of radiation-induced injury. Our data demonstrate 
that the TH17 population is specifically induced during development of
radiation-induced side effects in the colon. Moreover, Ad-MSC treatment modulates
the TH17 population and reduces the extracellular matrix remodelling process
induced following irradiation.

Simultaneous analysis of the transcripts of thousands of genes by cDNA
microarrays allows the identification of genetic regulatory mechanisms involved
in disease pathophysiology. The circadian clock circuitry controls essential cell
processes and the functioning of organ systems, which are characterized by
rhythmic variations with 24-hour periodicity. The derangement of these processes 
is involved in the basic mechanisms of inflammatory, metabolic, degenerative and 
neoplastic diseases. We evaluated by genome-wide cDNA microarray analysis the
transcriptome of endoscopic mucosal biopsies of patients with inflammatory bowel 
diseases (IBD) focusing on the expression of circadian genes in Crohn's disease
(CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Twenty-nine IBD patients (15 with CD and 14
with UC) were enrolled and mucosal biopsies were sampled at either inflamed or
adjacent non-inflamed areas of the colon. A total of 150 circadian genes involved
in pathways controlling crucial cell processes and tissue functions were
investigated. In CD specimens 50 genes were differentially expressed, and 21
genes resulted up-regulated when compared to healthy colonic mucosa. In UC
specimens 50 genes were differentially expressed, and 27 genes resulted
up-regulated when compared to healthy colonic mucosa. Among the core clock genes 
ARNTL2 and RORA were up-regulated, while CSNK2B, NPAS2, PER1 and PER3 were
down-regulated in CD specimens. Conversely, ARNTL2, CRY1, CSNK1E, RORA and TIPIN 
were up-regulated, while NR1D2 and PER3 were down-regulated in UC. In conclusion,
in CD and UC patients there are differences in the expression of circadian genes 
between normal and diseased intestinal mucosa. The deregulated genes evidenced by
transcriptome analysis in the major IBDs may play a crucial role in the
pathophysiological mechanisms and may suggest novel therapeutic approaches.

Genome-wide association studies of inflammatory bowel disease have identified
several risk loci in genes that regulate autophagy, and studies have provided
insight into the functional effects of these polymorphisms. We review the
mechanisms by which autophagy contributes to intestinal homeostasis, focusing on 
its cell type-specific roles in regulating gut ecology, restricting pathogenic
bacteria, and controlling inflammation. Based on this information, we are
beginning to understand how alterations in autophagy can contribute to intestinal
inflammation.

BACKGROUND: Antibodies (Abs) against adalimumab (ADL) have been associated with
low ADL levels and treatment failure.
AIM: To characterize the temporal characteristics of anti-ADL Ab appearance and
possible disappearance, and determine the clinical significance on drug efficacy 
and disease course.
METHODS: Cohort study including inflammatory bowel disease patients in whom
anti-ADL Abs had been assessed by radioimmunoassay (RIA) and, in case of
disappearance, by enzyme immunoassay, and functional reporter gene assay.
RESULTS: Anti-ADL Abs were evaluated in 133 serum samples from 72 patients.
Seventeen patients (24%) tested positive after median of 194 days, interquartile 
range of 66 to 361. The proportion with anti-ADL Abs was 22% after 1 year, and
32% from 21 months onwards. Anti-ADL Abs generally persisted at repeat
assessments during continued ADL therapy (n=8). Disappearance of anti-ADL Abs
during therapy (n=3) was presumably caused by methodological biases due to
detection of nonfunctional nonpersistent anti-ADL Abs by RIA, or false-negative
measurement at reassessment by RIA and reporter gene assay. Anti-ADL Abs appeared
pharmacologically active as judged by a median ADL concentration below limit of
detection versus 7.4 μg/mL in anti-ADL Ab-negative samples (P<0.0001). Anti-ADL
Abs associated with loss of response (odds ratio estimated 67, P<0.0001), and
shorter treatment duration (P<0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Abs against ADL appear in approximately one fourth of inflammatory
bowel disease patients with decreasing frequency over time and usually within 1
year of therapy. Anti-ADL Abs generally persist during continued ADL therapy, and
are associated with elimination of drug and treatment failure. Therefore, ADL
cessation should be considered when anti-ADL Abs are detected and supported by
clinical observations.

BACKGROUND: Interferon (IFN)-γ is a central pathogenesis factor in inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD) with pleiotropic effects on many different cell types.
However, as yet, the immune modulatory functions of IFN-γ in IBD have been
predominantly investigated. Based on previous studies showing that IFN-γ acts
antiangiogenic in colorectal carcinoma, we investigated the effects of IFN-γ on
the vascular system in IBD.
METHODS: Colon tissues of patients with IBD and dextran sulfate sodium-induced
colitis in mice were subjected to immunohistochemistry, quantitative real-time
polymerase chain reactions, and in situ hybridization to quantify cell
activation, angiogenesis, and immune responses. Vascular structure and
permeability in mice were analyzed by ultramicroscopy and in vivo confocal laser 
endomicroscopy.
RESULTS: We showed a significantly increased blood vessel density in IBD and
dextran sulfate sodium colitis. In mice, this was associated with a disorganized 
blood vessel structure and profound vascular leakage. As compared with genes
associated with angiogenesis, genes associated with inflammatory cell activation 
including IFN-γ were more strongly upregulated in colitis tissues. IFN-γ exerted 
direct effects on endothelial cells in IBD tissues in vivo, as indicated by the
expression of IFN-γ-induced guanylate binding protein 1 (GBP-1). Neutralization
of IFN-γ in the acute dextran sulfate sodium colitis model demonstrated that this
cytokine exerts endogenous angiostatic activity in IBD and contributes to
increased vascular permeability.
CONCLUSIONS: The dissection of the pleiotropic activities of IFN-γ in IBD
provides new insights to the pathological functions of this cytokine and may be
of high relevance for the optimization of combination therapy approaches.

The development of inflammatory diseases depends on complex interactions between 
several genes and various environmental factors. Discovering new genetic risk
factors and understanding the mechanisms whereby they influence disease
development is of paramount importance. We previously reported that deficiency in
Themis1, a new actor of TCR signaling, impairs regulatory T cell (Treg) function 
and predisposes Brown-Norway (BN) rats to spontaneous inflammatory bowel disease 
(IBD). In this study, we reveal that the epistasis between Themis1 and Vav1
controls the occurrence of these phenotypes. Indeed, by contrast with BN rats,
Themis1 deficiency in Lewis rats neither impairs Treg suppressive functions nor
induces pathological manifestations. By using congenic lines on the BN genomic
background, we show that the impact of Themis1 deficiency on Treg suppressive
functions depends on a 117-kb interval coding for a R63W polymorphism that
impacts Vav1 expression and functions. Indeed, the introduction of a 117-kb
interval containing the Lewis Vav1-R63 variant restores Treg function and
protects Themis1-deficient BN rats from spontaneous IBD development. We further
show that Themis1 binds more efficiently to the BN Vav1-W63 variant and is
required to stabilize its recruitment to the transmembrane adaptor LAT and to
fully promote the activation of Erk kinases. Together, these results highlight
the importance of the signaling pathway involving epistasis between Themis1 and
Vav1 in the control of Treg suppressive function and susceptibility to IBD
development.

Low expression of vitamin D receptor (VDR) and dysfunction of vitamin D/VDR
signaling are reported in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD);
therefore, restoration of VDR function to control inflammation in IBD is
desirable. Probiotics have been used in the treatment of IBD. However, the role
of probiotics in the modulation of VDR signaling to effectively reduce
inflammation is unknown. We identified a novel role of probiotics in activating
VDR activity, thus inhibiting inflammation, using cell models and VDR knockout
mice. We found that the probiotics Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG (LGG) and
Lactobacillus plantarum (LP) increased VDR protein expression in both mouse and
human intestinal epithelial cells. Using the VDR luciferase reporter vector, we
detected increased transcriptional activity of VDR after probiotic treatment.
Probiotics increased the expression of the VDR target genes, such as
antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin, at the transcriptional level. Furthermore,
the role of probiotics in regulating VDR signaling was tested in vivo using a
Salmonella-colitis model in VDR knockout mice. Probiotic treatment conferred
physiological and histologic protection from Salmonella-induced colitis in
VDR(+/+) mice, whereas probiotics had no effects in the VDR(-/-) mice. Probiotic 
treatment also enhanced numbers of Paneth cells, which secrete AMPs for host
defense. These data indicate that the VDR pathway is required for probiotic
protection in colitis. Understanding how probiotics enhance VDR signaling and
inhibit inflammation will allow probiotics to be used effectively, resulting in
innovative approaches to the prevention and treatment of chronic inflammation.

Although Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)- and nucleotide-binding oligomerization
domain 2 (NOD2)-mediated signaling mechanisms have been extensively studied
individually, the crosstalk between them in the regulation of intestinal mucosal 
defense and tissue homeostasis has been underappreciated. Here, we uncover some
novel activities of NOD2 by gene expression profiling revealing the global nature
of the cross-regulation between TLR4- and NOD2-mediated signaling. Specifically, 
NOD2 is able to sense the intensity of TLR4-mediated signaling, resulting in
either synergistic stimulation of Interluekin-12 (IL-12) production when the TLR 
signaling intensity is low; or in the inhibition of IL-12 synthesis and
maintenance of intestinal mucosal homeostasis when the TLR signaling intensifies.
This balancing act is mediated through receptor-interacting serine/threonine
kinase 2, and the transcriptional regulator CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α
(C/EBPα) via its serine 248 phosphorylation by Protein Kinase C. Mice deficient
in C/EBPα in the hematopoietic compartment are highly susceptible to chemically
induced experimental colitis in an IL-12-dependent manner. Additionally, in
contrast to the dogma, we find that the major Crohn's disease-associated NOD2
mutations could cause a primarily immunodeficient phenotype by selectively
impairing TLR4-mediated IL-12 production and host defense. To restore the
impaired homeostasis would be a way forward to developing novel therapeutic
strategies for inflammatory bowel diseases.

Arterial smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) undergo phenotypic changes during
development and pathological processes in vivo and during cell culture in vitro. 
Our previous studies demonstrated that retrovirally mediated expression of the
versican V3 splice variant (V3) by ASMCs retards cell proliferation and migration
in vitro and reduces neointimal thickening and macrophage and lipid accumulation 
in animal models of vascular injury and atherosclerosis. However, the molecular
pathways induced by V3 expression that are responsible for these changes are not 
yet clear. In this study, we employed a microarray approach to examine how
expression of V3 induced changes in gene expression and the molecular pathways in
rat ASMCs. We found that forced expression of V3 by ASMCs affected expression of 
521 genes by more than 1.5-fold. Gene ontology analysis showed that components of
the extracellular matrix were the most significantly affected by V3 expression.
In addition, genes regulating the formation of the cytoskeleton, which also serve
as markers of contractile smooth muscle cells (SMCs), were significantly
up-regulated. In contrast, components of the complement system, chemokines,
chemokine receptors, and transcription factors crucial for regulating
inflammatory processes were among the genes most down-regulated. Consistently, we
found that the level of myocardin, a key transcription factor promoting
contractile SMC phenotype, was greatly increased, and the proinflammatory
transcription factors NFκB1 and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β were
significantly attenuated in V3-expressing SMCs. Overall, these findings
demonstrate that V3 expression reprograms ASMCs promoting differentiated and
anti-inflammatory phenotypes.

Emerging evidence reveals that various cytokines and tissue microenvironments
contribute to liver inflammation and autoimmunity, and IL-17 family is one of
highlights acknowledged. Although the implication of IL-17 family in most common 
autoimmune diseases (such as psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, and
rheumatoid arthritis) has been extensively characterized, the role of this
critical family in pathophysiology of autoimmune liver diseases (AILD) still
needs to be clarified. In the review, we look into the intriguing biology of
IL-17 family and further dissect on the intricate role of IL-17-mediated pathway 
in AILD. Considering encouraging data from preclinical and clinical trials, IL-17
targeted therapy has shown promises in several certain autoimmune conditions.
However, blocking IL-17-mediated pathway is just beginning, and more fully
investigation and reflection are required. Taking together, targeting
IL-17-mediated responses may open up new areas of potential clinical treatment
for AILD.

The probiotic yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae var boulardii is widely used as a
low cost and efficient adjuvant against gastrointestinal tract disorders such as 
inflammatory bowel disease and treatment of several types of diarrhea, both in
humans and animals. S. boulardii exerts its protective mechanisms by binding and 
neutralizing enteric pathogens or their toxins, by reducing inflammation and by
inducing the secretion of sIgA. Although several S. cerevisiae strains have
proven probiotic potential in both humans and animals, only S. boulardii is
currently licensed for use in humans. Recently, some researchers started using S.
boulardii as heterologous protein expression systems. Combined with their
probiotic activity, the use of these strains as prophylactic and therapeutic
proteins carriers might result in a positive combined effort to fight specific
diseases. Here, we provide an overview of the current use of S. cerevisiae
strains as probiotics and their mechanisms of action. We also discuss their
potential to produce molecules with biotherapeutic application and the advantages
and hurdles of this approach. Finally, we suggest future directions and
alternatives for which the combined effort of specific immunomodulatory effects
of probiotic S. cerevisiae strains and ability to express desired foreign genes
would find a practical application.

AIM: The etiopathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is unclear and
further understanding of the mechanisms that regulate intestinal barrier
integrity and function could give insight into its pathophysiology and mode of
action of current drugs used to treat human IBD. Therefore, we investigated how
intestinal inflammation affects Map kinase gene expression in rats, and if
current intestinal anti-inflammatory drugs (sulphasalazine, prednisolone and
azathioprine) act on these expressions.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Macroscopic parameters of lesion, biochemical markers
(myeloperoxidase, alkaline phosphatase and glutathione), gene expression of 13Map
kinases, and histologic evaluations (optic, electronic scanning and transmission 
microscopy) were performed in rats with colonic inflammation induced by
trinitrobenzenesulphonic (TNBS) acid.
KEY FINDINGS: The colonic inflammation was characterized by a significant
increase in the expression of Mapk1, Mapk3 and Mapk9 accompanied by a significant
reduction in the expression ofMapk6. Alterations inMapk expression induced by
TNBS were differentially counteracted after treatment with sulphasalazine,
prednisolone and azathioprine. Protective effects were also related to the
significant reduction of oxidative stress, which was related to increase Mapk1/3 
expressions, which were reduced after pharmacological treatment.
SIGNIFICANCE: Mapk1, Mapk3,Mapk6 and Mapk9 gene expressionswere affected by
colonic inflammation induced by TNBS in rats and counteracted by sulphasalazine, 
prednisolone and azathioprine treatments, suggesting that these genes participate
in the pharmacological response produced for these drugs.

Blastocystis is a common single-celled intestinal parasitic genus, comprising
several subtypes. Here, we screened data obtained by metagenomic analysis of
faecal DNA for Blastocystis by searching for subtype-specific genes in
coabundance gene groups, which are groups of genes that covary across a selection
of 316 human faecal samples, hence representing genes originating from a single
subtype. The 316 faecal samples were from 236 healthy individuals, 13 patients
with Crohn's disease (CD) and 67 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). The
prevalence of Blastocystis was 20.3% in the healthy individuals and 14.9% in
patients with UC. Meanwhile, Blastocystis was absent in patients with CD.
Individuals with intestinal microbiota dominated by Bacteroides were much less
prone to having Blastocystis-positive stool (Matthew's correlation coefficient = 
-0.25, P < 0.0001) than individuals with Ruminococcus- and Prevotella-driven
enterotypes. This is the first study to investigate the relationship between
Blastocystis and communities of gut bacteria using a metagenomics approach. The
study serves as an example of how it is possible to retrospectively investigate
microbial eukaryotic communities in the gut using metagenomic datasets targeting 
the bacterial component of the intestinal microbiome and the interplay between
these microbial communities.

The mucosal immune response in the setting of intestinal inflammation contributes
to colorectal cancer. IL10 signaling has a central role in gut homeostasis and is
impaired in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Out of two IL10 receptor subunits, 
IL10R1 and IL10R2, the latter is shared among the IL10 family of cytokines and
activates STAT signaling. STAT3 is oncogenic in colorectal cancer; however,
knowledge about IL10 signaling upstream of STAT3 in colorectal cancer is lacking.
Here, expression of IL10 signaling genes was examined in matched pairs from
normal and tumor tissue from colorectal cancer patients showing overexpression
(mRNA, protein) of IL10R2 and STAT3 but not IL10R1. IL10R2 overexpression was
related to microsatellite stability. Transient overexpression of IL10R2 in HT29
cells increased proliferation upon ligand activation (IL10 and IL22). IL22, and
not IL10, phosphorylated STAT3 along with increased phosphorylation of AKT and
ERK. A significantly higher expression of IL22R1 and IL10R2 was also confirmed in
a separate cohort of colorectal cancer samples. IL22 expression was elevated in
gut mucosa from patients with IBD and colitis-associated cancer, which also
exhibited increased expression of IL22R1 but not its coreceptor IL10R2. Overall, 
these data indicate that overexpression of IL10R2 and STAT3 contributes to
colorectal carcinogenesis in microsatellite-stable tumors through IL22/STAT3
signaling.

Adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) strains are detected more frequently
within mucosal lesions of patients with Crohn's disease (CD). The AIEC phenotype 
consists of adherence and invasion of intestinal epithelial cells and survival
within macrophages of these bacteria in vitro. Our aim was to identify candidate 
transcripts that distinguish AIEC from non-invasive E. coli (NIEC) strains and
might be useful for rapid and accurate identification of AIEC by
culture-independent technology. We performed comparative RNA-Sequence (RNASeq)
analysis using AIEC strain LF82 and NIEC strain HS during exponential and
stationary growth. Differential expression analysis of coding sequences (CDS)
homologous to both strains demonstrated 224 and 241 genes with increased and
decreased expression, respectively, in LF82 relative to HS. Transition metal
transport and siderophore metabolism related pathway genes were up-regulated,
while glycogen metabolic and oxidation-reduction related pathway genes were
down-regulated, in LF82. Chemotaxis related transcripts were up-regulated in LF82
during the exponential phase, but flagellum-dependent motility pathway genes were
down-regulated in LF82 during the stationary phase. CDS that mapped only to the
LF82 genome accounted for 747 genes. We applied an in silico subtractive genomics
approach to identify CDS specific to AIEC by incorporating the genomes of 10
other previously phenotyped NIEC. From this analysis, 166 CDS mapped to the LF82 
genome and lacked homology to any of the 11 human NIEC strains. We compared these
CDS across 13 AIEC, but none were homologous in each. Four LF82 gene loci
belonging to clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats region
(CRISPR)--CRISPR-associated (Cas) genes were identified in 4 to 6 AIEC and absent
from all non-pathogenic bacteria. As previously reported, AIEC strains were
enriched for pdu operon genes. One CDS, encoding an excisionase, was shared by 9 
AIEC strains. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays
for 6 genes were conducted on fecal and ileal RNA samples from 22 inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD), and 32 patients without IBD (non-IBD). The expression of Cas
loci was detected in a higher proportion of CD than non-IBD fecal and ileal RNA
samples (p <0.05). These results support a comparative genomic/transcriptomic
approach towards identifying candidate AIEC signature transcripts.

BACKGROUND: The selenoprotein glutathione peroxidase 2 (GPx2) is highly expressed
in the gastrointestinal epithelium. During inflammatory bowel disease and
colorectal cancer, GPx2 expression is enhanced.
METHODS: We analyzed GPx2 expression and transcriptional regulation during the
different phases of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice and in
cytokine-treated colorectal cancer cells.
RESULTS: In the colon of DSS-treated mice, GPx2 was upregulated during the acute 
and recovery phase. In the latter, it was specifically localized in regenerating 
ki67-positive crypts next to ulcerations. In cultured cells, endogenous GPx2
expression and GPx2 promoter activity were enhanced by the anti-inflammatory
mediators 15-deoxy-Δ(12,14)-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) and interleukin-22
(IL-22), while it was unaffected by classical proinflammatory cytokines like
IL-1β. Induction of GPx2 expression by 15d-PGJ2 was mediated through Nrf2. In
contrast, in DSS-treated Nrf2-KO mice GPx2 expression remained upregulated during
recovery, which appeared to be independent of Nrf2. IL-22 activates transcription
factors of the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) family. 
Therefore, we analyzed the GPx2 promoter for putative STAT-responsive elements
and identified 4 of them. Point mutation of the binding element next to the
transcription start completely abolished promoter activation after IL-22
treatment and after cotransfection of STAT expression plasmids. To show in vivo
relevance of the obtained results, we performed immunohistochemistry for
phospho-STAT3 and GPx2. Especially during acute colitis, GPx2 and nuclear STAT3
colocalized in inflamed areas.
CONCLUSIONS: GPx2 is a novel target of STAT transcription factors. The
upregulation of GPx2 by IL-22 indicates that GPx2 might be important for the
resolution of inflammation.

Microbiome researchers frequently want to know how abundant a particular
microbial gene or pathway is across different human hosts, including its
association with disease and its co-occurrence with other genes or microbial
taxa. With thousands of publicly available metagenomes, these questions should be
easy to answer. However, computational barriers prevent most researchers from
conducting such analyses. We address this problem with MetaQuery, a web
application for rapid and quantitative analysis of specific genes in the human
gut microbiome. The user inputs one or more query genes, and our software returns
the estimated abundance of these genes across 1267 publicly available fecal
metagenomes from American, European and Chinese individuals. In addition, our
application performs downstream statistical analyses to identify features that
are associated with gene variation, including other query genes (i.e. gene
co-variation), taxa, clinical variables (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease and
diabetes) and average genome size. The speed and accessibility of MetaQuery are a
step toward democratizing metagenomics research, which should allow many
researchers to query the abundance and variation of specific genes in the human
gut microbiome.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: http://metaquery.docpollard.org.

BACKGROUND: The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are common, complex disorders
in which genetic and environmental factors are believed to interact leading to
chronic inflammatory responses against the gut microbiota. Earlier genetic
studies performed in mostly adult population of European descent identified 163
loci affecting IBD risk, but most have relatively modest effect sizes, and
altogether explain only ~20% of the genetic susceptibility. Pediatric onset
represents about 25% of overall incident cases in IBD, characterized by distinct 
disease physiology, course and risks. The goal of this study is to compare the
allelic architecture of early onset IBD with adult onset in population of
European descent.
METHODS: We performed a fine mapping association study of early onset IBD using
high-density Immunochip genotyping on 1008 pediatric-onset IBD cases (801 Crohn's
disease; 121 ulcerative colitis and 86 IBD undetermined) and 1633 healthy
controls. Of the 158 SNP genotypes obtained (out of the 163 identified in adult
onset), this study replicated 4% (5 SNPs out of 136) of the SNPs identified in
the Crohn's disease (CD) cases and 0.8% (1 SNP out of 128) in the ulcerative
colitis (UC) cases. Replicated SNPs implicated the well known NOD2 and IL23R. The
point estimate for the odds ratio (ORs) for NOD2 was above and outside the
confidence intervals reported in adult onset. A polygenic liability score weakly 
predicted the age of onset for a larger collection of CD cases (p< 0.03, R2=
0.007), but not for the smaller number of UC cases.
CONCLUSIONS: The allelic architecture of common susceptibility variants for early
onset IBD is similar to that of adult onset. This immunochip genotyping study
failed to identify additional common variants that may explain the distinct
phenotype that characterize early onset IBD. A comprehensive dissection of
genetic loci is necessary to further characterize the genetic architecture of
early onset IBD.

The polymorphism ATG16L1 T300A, associated with increased risk of Crohn's
disease, impairs pathogen defense mechanisms including selective autophagy, but
specific pathway interactions altered by the risk allele remain unknown. Here, we
use perturbational profiling of human peripheral blood cells to reveal that
CLEC12A is regulated in an ATG16L1-T300A-dependent manner. Antibacterial
autophagy is impaired in CLEC12A-deficient cells, and this effect is exacerbated 
in the presence of the ATG16L1(∗)300A risk allele. Clec12a(-/-) mice are more
susceptible to Salmonella infection, supporting a role for CLEC12A in
antibacterial defense pathways in vivo. CLEC12A is recruited to sites of
bacterial entry, bacteria-autophagosome complexes, and sites of sterile membrane 
damage. Integrated genomics identified a functional interaction between CLEC12A
and an E3-ubiquitin ligase complex that functions in antibacterial autophagy.
These data identify CLEC12A as early adaptor molecule for antibacterial autophagy
and highlight perturbational profiling as a method to elucidate defense pathways 
in complex genetic disease.

The association between Interleukin-23R gene polymorphism and Crohn's disease
(CD) in Caucasians is still controversial. Thus, a meta-analysis was performed to
evaluate the correlation between this gene variant and CD risk. We retrieved the 
available data from EMBASE and PUBMED until May 1, 2014, and evaluated the effect
of rs7517847 in Caucasians. The significant associations were confirmed between
rs7517847 and CD risk in dominant models (TT/TG versus GG: OR = 1.652, 95% CI
1.277, 2.137), allelic model (T allele versus G allele: OR = 1.327, 95% CI 1.198,
1.469), homozygote comparison (TT versus GG: OR = 1.890, 95% CI 1.465, 2.437),
heterozygote comparison (TG versus GG: OR = 1.509, 95% CI 1.161, 1.960), and
recessive model (TT versusTG/GG: OR = 1.409, 95% CI 1.279, 1.552). In conclusion,
this meta-analysis demonstrates that rs7517847 is associated with the risk of CD 
in Caucasians. These findings show that IL-23R genes confer susceptibility to CD 
in the Caucasians.

Experimental models of colitis in mice have been used extensively for analyzing
the molecular events that occur during inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
development. However, it is uncertain to what extent the experimental models
reproduce features of human IBD. This is largely due to the lack of precise
methods for direct and comprehensive comparison of mouse and human inflamed colon
tissue at the molecular level. Here, we use global gene expression patterns of
two sets of pediatric IBD and two mouse models of colitis to obtain a direct
comparison of the genome signatures of mouse and human IBD. By comparing the two 
sets of pediatric IBD microarray data, we found 83 genes were differentially
expressed in a similar manner between pediatric Crohn's disease and ulcerative
colitis. Up-regulation of the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) gene that
maps to 17q12, a confirmed IBD susceptibility loci, indicates that our comparison
study can reveal known genetic associations with IBD. In comparing pediatric IBD 
and experimental colitis microarray data, we found common signatures amongst them
including: (1) up-regulation of CXCL9 and S100A8; (2) cytokine-cytokine receptor 
pathway dysregulation; and (3) over-represented IRF1 and IRF2 transcription
binding sites in the promoter region of up-regulated genes, and HNF1A and Lhx3
binding sites were over-represented in the promoter region of the down-regulated 
genes. In summary, this study provides a comprehensive view of transcriptome
changes between different pediatric IBD populations in comparison with different 
colitis models. These findings reveal several new molecular targets for further
study in the regulation of colitis.

We previously identified TNFSF15 as the most significant susceptibility gene at
non-HLA loci for both primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and Crohn's diseases (CD)
in the Japanese population. The aim of this study is to identify further disease 
susceptibility genes shared by PBC and CD. We selected 15 and 33 genetic variants
that were significantly associated with PBC and CD, respectively, based on
previously reported genome-wide association studies of the Japanese population.
Next, an association study was independently performed for these genetic variants
in CD (1312 CD patients and 3331 healthy controls) and PBC (1279 PBC patients and
1015 healthy controls) cohorts. Two CD susceptibility genes, ICOSLG rs2838519 and
IL12B rs6556412, were also nominally associated with susceptibility to PBC
(P=3.85 × 10(-2) and P=8.40 × 10(-3), respectively). Three PBC susceptibility
genes, CXCR5 rs6421571, STAT4 rs7574865 and NFKB1 rs230534, were nominally
associated with susceptibility to CD (P=2.82 × 10(-2), P=3.88 × 10(-2) and P=2.04
× 10(-2), respectively). The effect of ICOSLG and CXCR5 variants were concordant 
but the effect of STAT4, NFKB1 and IL12B variants were discordant for PBC and CD.
TNFSF15 and ICOSLG-CXCR5 might constitute a shared pathogenic pathway in the
development of PBC and CD in the Japanese population, whereas IL12B-STAT4-NFKB1
might constitute an opposite pathogenic pathway, reflecting the different balance
between Th1 and Th17 in the two diseases.

IL23/IL17 pathway plays an important role in the development of inflammatory
bowel diseases (IBD). In general, the genes encoding the cytokines are
genetically polymorphic and polymorphisms in genes IL23R and IL17 have been
proved to be associated with its susceptibility to inflammatory diseases as well 
as cancer including colorectal cancer. Moreover, it has been shown that these
interleukins are involved in anti-tumor or pro-tumor effects of various cancers. 
Previously, we showed that there is a significant association between IL17A,
IL17F and IL23R polymorphisms as well as the occurrence of colorectal cancer and 
the clinical features of the disease. The purpose of the present work is to
investigate an association between IL17A, IL17F and IL23R polymorphisms in 102
Tunisian patients with colorectal cancer treatment. The association was analyzed 
by statistical tools. We found that patients with mutated genotypes of IL17A
G197A SNP could be a risk factor for the inefficiency of chemotherapy and
radiotherapy. Unlike IL17F variant, patients with wild type genotypes require
surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. On the one hand, we found no evidence that
supports a significant association between IL23R polymorphism and the combined
genotypes of these three genes and the colorectal cancer treatment. On the other 
hand, we showed that there is an important interaction between IL17A/IL17F
polymorphisms and the stage of the disease as well as its treatment. Finally,
patients with IL17F wild type genotype highlighted that there is a valid longer
OS without all treatments and with radiotherapy and a neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
In contrast, we observed that there are no relationships between IL17A, IL23R and
the survival of these patients neither with nor without the treatment. Our
results suggest that polymorphisms in IL17A and IL17F genes may be a predictive
source of colorectal cancer therapy type. Therefore, IL17F may serve as an
independent prognostic factor for overall survival in patients with colorectal
cancer.

the year 2010-2014 were enrolled in the study. The proband, male, 26 days old,
weight 3.73 kg, presented with recurrent fever, increased stool frequency since 9
days of age, and was hospitalized at the age of 6 months in 2014. The proband's
brother, male, 6 months old, weight 8 kg, had repeated bloody and mucous diarrhea
for more than five months, recurrent fever five days, and was hospitalized in
2010. The blood samples were collected from the children and their families for
IL-10 receptor genes including IL-10 receptor α subunit (IL-10RA) and β subunit
(IL-10RB) PCR amplification. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) was used to amplify the proband IL-10RA transcripts. Sequencing was
performed on the PCR products forward and reversely. Western blot analysis was
used for protein expression of the proband and normal control's IL-10RA and
P-STAT3 (Tyr705) expression after IL-10 stimulation, TNF-α level was detected
using Human TNF-α ELISA Kit after PBMC was cultured and stimulated.
RESULT: The proband and his brother were IBD patients. Genome sequencing showed
mutation in c.537G>A, namely the exon 4 and intron 4 connections changed CA/GT
for CG/GT. Sequencing of the RT-PCR products and T-A clone showed that the
mutation was (c.519-537del GGTGCCGGGAAACTTCAC, p.LYS173ASNfs*7), as the splice
mutation. Two gene mutations were novel mutation. The parents were the mutations 
carrier. Both of the children were compound heterozygous mutations in IL-10RA.
The Western blot analysis showed that the patient and normal children can express
IL-10RA protein, however, the function of IL-10RA had obvious defects in the
patient, IL-10RA downstream signaling pathways P-STAT3 had no expression. The
average level of TNF-α secreted by PBMC after LPS + IL-10 co-stimulation in
patient was significantly increased as compared with control group ((2 100±356)
vs. (200±50) ng/L, t=9.154, P=0.001), suggesting that interleukin-10-dependent
negative feedback regulation is disrupted in the patient.
CONCLUSION: IL-10 receptor mutations can cause neonatal-IBD, for which common
treatment effect is poor. Early diagnosis and allogeneic stem-cell
transplantation performed may save the children's life.

Arctigenin, the main effective constituent of Arctium lappa L. fruit, has
previously been proven to dramatically attenuate dextran sulfate sodium
(DSS)-induced colitis in mice, a frequently used animal model of inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD). As Th1 and Th17 cells play a crucial role in the
pathogenesis of IBD, the present study addressed whether and how arctigenin
exerted anti-colitis efficacy by interfering with the differentiation and
activation of Th1/Th17 cells. In vitro, arctigenin was shown to markedly inhibit 
the differentiation of Th17 cells from naïve T cells, and moderately inhibit the 
differentiation of Th1 cells, which was accompanied by lowered phosphorylation of
STAT3 and STAT4, respectively. In contrast, arctigenin was lack of marked effect 
on the differentiation of either Th2 or regulatory T cells. Furthermore,
arctigenin was shown to suppress the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1
(mTORC1) pathway in T cells as demonstrated by down-regulated phosphorylation of 
the downstream target genes p70S6K and RPS6, and it functioned independent of two
well-known upstream kinases PI3K/AKT and ERK. Arctigenin was also able to inhibit
the activity of mTORC1 by dissociating raptor from mTOR. Interestingly, the
inhibitory effect of arctigenin on T cell differentiation disappeared under a
status of mTORC1 overactivation via knockdown of tuberous sclerosis complex 2
(TSC2, a negative regulator of mTORC1) or pretreatment of leucine (an agonist of 
mTOR). In DSS-induced mice, the inhibition of Th1/Th17 responses and anti-colitis
effect of arctigenin were abrogated by leucine treatment. In conclusion,
arctigenin ameliorates colitis through down-regulating the differentiation of Th1
and Th17 cells via mTORC1 pathway.

MOTIVATION: Discerning genetic contributions to diseases not only enhances our
understanding of disease mechanisms, but also leads to translational
opportunities for drug discovery. Recent computational approaches incorporate
disease phenotypic similarities to improve the prediction power of disease gene
discovery. However, most current studies used only one data source of human
disease phenotype. We present an innovative and generic strategy for combining
multiple different data sources of human disease phenotype and predicting
disease-associated genes from integrated phenotypic and genomic data.
RESULTS: To demonstrate our approach, we explored a new phenotype database from
biomedical ontologies and constructed Disease Manifestation Network (DMN). We
combined DMN with mimMiner, which was a widely used phenotype database in disease
gene prediction studies. Our approach achieved significantly improved performance
over a baseline method, which used only one phenotype data source. In the
leave-one-out cross-validation and de novo gene prediction analysis, our approach
achieved the area under the curves of 90.7% and 90.3%, which are significantly
higher than 84.2% (P < e(-4)) and 81.3% (P < e(-12)) for the baseline approach.
We further demonstrated that our predicted genes have the translational potential
in drug discovery. We used Crohn's disease as an example and ranked the candidate
drugs based on the rank of drug targets. Our gene prediction approach prioritized
druggable genes that are likely to be associated with Crohn's disease
pathogenesis, and our rank of candidate drugs successfully prioritized the Food
and Drug Administration-approved drugs for Crohn's disease. We also found
literature evidence to support a number of drugs among the top 200 candidates. In
summary, we demonstrated that a novel strategy combining unique disease phenotype
data with system approaches can lead to rapid drug discovery.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2, Tnfrsf1b) regulates
multiple aspects of immune function, but little is known about its role in the
immunopathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We investigated whether
TNFR2 restricts the activity of specific immune cell subtypes to protect against 
the development of colitis in mice.
METHODS: Tnfr2(-/-) mice were crossed with interleukin (Il) 10(-/-) mice, which
spontaneously develop colitis, to generate Il10(-/-)Tnfr2(-/-) mice. Colonic
tissues were collected from Il10(-/-)Tnfr2(-/-) mice along with Il10(-/-) mice
(controls) and analyzed by flow cytometry and histology. Bone marrow
was transplanted into Il10(-/-) and Il10(-/-)Tnfr2(-/-) mice from Il10(-/-) or
Il10(-/-)Tnfr2(-/-) donors by intravenous injection. CD8(+) T cells were
neutralized in Il10(-/-)Tnfr2(-/-) mice by intraperitoneal injection of anti-CD8 
or isotype control antibodies. Colitis was induced in Rag2(-/-) mice by
intravenous injections of naïve CD8(+) T cells isolated from C57BL/6 or
Tnfr2(-/-) mice.
RESULTS: Il10(-/-)Tnfr2(-/-) mice spontaneously developed more severe colitis
compared with Il10(-/-) controls, characterized by selective expansion of colonic
CD8(+) T cells. Transplantation of TNFR2-deficient bone marrow resulted in
significantly increased incidence and severity of colitis. Transcriptome analyses
showed that the expression of genes regulated by TNFR2 were specific to CD8(+) T 
cells and included genes associated with risk for IBD. Depletion of CD8(+) T
cells from Il10(-/-)Tnfr2(-/-) mice prevented colonic inflammation. Adoptive
transfer of TNFR2-null naïve CD8(+) T cells compared with CD8(+) T cells from
control mice increased the severity of colitis that developed in Rag2(-/-) mice.
CONCLUSIONS: TNFR2 protects mice from colitis by inhibiting the expansion of
colonic CD8(+) T cells. TNFR2 regulates expression of genes that regulate CD8(+) 
T cells and have been associated with susceptibility to IBD. Disruption in TNFR2 
signaling might therefore be associated with pathogenesis. Strategies to increase
levels or activity of TNFR2 and thereby reduce the activity of CD8(+) T cells
might be developed to treat IBD patients with CD8(+) T cell dysfunction.

OBJECTIVE: The aims of the study were to characterize the genotype profile of
nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 (NOD2)-associated
autoinflammatory disease (NAID) and to report an extended study of the disease.
METHODS: A total of 143 adult patients presented with clinical phenotypes
suspicious for NAID and all were genotyped for NOD2 sequence variants. The
genotype frequencies were compared between our cohort and literature reports.
These patients were divided into two groups predicated on the presence or absence
of NOD2 variants.
RESULTS: Of the 143 patients, 67 (47%) carry NOD2 variants; the genotype
frequency was significantly higher among our cohort than in the historical
healthy controls. Fifty-four of the 67 carriers of NOD2 variants had NAID, which 
has a genotype profile that is somewhat different from Crohn's disease. All NAID 
patients were non-Jewish whites and 69% were women. The median age at onset was
33.5 years and the median disease duration at diagnosis was 10.7 years. NAID was 
sporadic in 93% of cases. Patients typically presented with periodic fever,
dermatitis and inflammatory arthritis. As compared with the NOD2 variant-negative
patients, the skin disease more typically manifested as erythematous patches or
plaques on the trunk. Oligopolyarthritis/-arthralgia was common, with
characteristic distal lower extremity swelling. Associated NOD2 variants were
primarily IVS8(+158) or compound IVS8(+158) and R702W.
CONCLUSION: This study underscores the NOD2 genotype association with NAID, which
is a genetically complex multisystem disorder. It differs phenotypically from
Crohn's disease with a distinct genotype profile. This disease may be more common
than initially thought.

The commensal Enterococcus faecalis is among the most common causes of nosocomial
infections. Recent findings regarding increased abundance of enterococci in the
intestinal microbiota of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases and induction 
of colitis in IL-10-deficient (IL-10-/-) mice put a new perspective on the
contribution of E. faecalis to chronic intestinal inflammation. Based on the
expression of virulence-related genes in the inflammatory milieu of IL-10-/- mice
using RNA-sequencing analysis, we characterized the colitogenic role of two
bacterial structures that substantially impact on E. faecalis virulence by
different mechanisms: the enterococcal polysaccharide antigen and cell
surface-associated lipoproteins. Germ-free wild type and IL-10-/- mice were
monoassociated with E. faecalis wild type OG1RF or the respective isogenic
mutants for 16 weeks. Intestinal tissue and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) were
collected to characterize tissue pathology, loss of intestinal barrier function, 
bacterial adhesion to intestinal epithelium and immune cell activation. Bone
marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) were stimulated with bacterial lysates and 
E. faecalis virulence was additionally investigated in three invertebrate models.
Colitogenic activity of wild type E. faecalis (OG1RF score: 7.2±1.2) in
monoassociated IL-10-/- mice was partially impaired in E. faecalis lacking
enterococcal polysaccharide antigen (ΔepaB score: 4.7±2.3; p<0.05) and was almost
completely abrogated in E. faecalis deficient for lipoproteins (Δlgt score:
2.3±2.3; p<0.0001). Consistently both E. faecalis mutants showed significantly
impaired virulence in Galleria mellonella and Caenorhabditis elegans. Loss of
E-cadherin in the epithelium was shown for all bacterial strains in inflamed
IL-10-/- but not wild type mice. Inactivation of epaB in E. faecalis reduced
microcolony and biofilm formation in vitro, altered bacterial adhesion to
intestinal epithelium of germ-free Manduca sexta larvae and impaired penetration 
into the colonic mucus layer of IL-10-/- mice. Lipoprotein-deficient E. faecalis 
exhibited an impaired TLR2-mediated activation of BMDCs in vitro despite their
ability to fully reactivate MLN cells as well as MLN-derived colitogenic T cells 
ex vivo. E. faecalis virulence factors accounting for bacterial adhesion to
mucosal surfaces as well as intestinal barrier disruption partially contribute to
colitogenic activity of E. faecalis. Beyond their well-known role in infections, 
cell surface-associated lipoproteins are essential structures for colitogenic
activity of E. faecalis by mediating innate immune cell activation.

BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are inflammatory bowel
diseases involving a genetically determined inappropriate mucosal immune response
towards luminal antigens, including resident bacterial flora. Recent studies
identified susceptibility genes involved in autophagy.
AIMS: We analyzed known autophagic loci (IRGM, ULK1 and AMBRA1) previously
described as associated with inflammatory bowel diseases or with other autoimmune
and/or inflammatory disorders in a sample of Italian inflammatory bowel diseases 
patients in order to confirm their possible involvement and relative contribution
in the disease.
METHODS: We performed a case-control association study, a sub-phenotype
correlation and a haplotype analysis. The analysis included 263 Crohn's disease, 
206 ulcerative colitis patients and 245 matched healthy controls. Five
polymorphisms were genotyped by allelic discrimination assays.
RESULTS: IRGM was the most strongly associated with Crohn's disease
susceptibility [rs13361189: P=0.011, OR=1.66 [95% CI: (1.12-2.45)]; rs4958847:
P=0.05, OR=1.43 [95% CI: (1-2.03)]. The SNP rs13361189 was also found to increase
the risk of Crohn's disease clinical sub-phenotype (fibrostricturing behaviour,
ileal disease, perianal disease, intestinal resection). These findings suggest
that IRGM variants may modulate clinical characteristics of Crohn's disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms IRGM rs13361189 and rs4958847 polymorphisms to be
important for Crohn's disease susceptibility and phenotype modulation, in
accordance with previous findings.

BACKGROUND: Alterations in the intestinal microbiota, characterized by depletion 
of anti-inflammatory bacteria, such as Firmicutes, in patients with ulcerative
colitis (UC) have prompted interest in microbiota-modulating strategies for this 
condition. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of fecal and synthetic 
human microbial ecosystems, low or enriched in Firmicutes, on colitis
susceptibility and host immune responses.
METHODS: The microbiota of selected healthy and UC human donors was characterized
by culture method and 16S rRNA-based sequencing. Germ-free mice were colonized
with fecal or a synthetic ecosystem enriched (healthy donors) or low (UC donors) 
in Firmicutes. Experimental colitis was induced using dextran sodium sulfate.
Colon transcriptome and colon lamina propria cells were evaluated in mice
postcolonization by RNA-seq and flow cytometry, respectively, and T helper (TH)
17 differentiation was assessed in vitro.
RESULTS: Mice colonized with microbiota from patients with UC low in Firmicutes
had increased sensitivity to colitis compared with mice colonized with fecal or
synthetic ecosystems rich in Firmicutes. Microbiota low in Firmicutes increased
expression of TH17-related genes and expansion of interleukin-17A-expressing CD4 
cells in vivo. Supplementation with bacterial isolates belonging to the
Firmicutes phylum abrogated the heightened TH17 responses in vitro.
CONCLUSIONS: A microbiota rich in Firmicutes derived from fecal samples of a
healthy human donor, or assembled synthetically, downregulated colonic
inflammation and TH17 pathways in mice. The results support the use of
ecobiotherapy strategies, enriched in Firmicutes, for the prevention or treatment
of UC.

Beneficial microbes that target molecules and pathways, such as oxidative stress,
which can negatively affect both host and microbiota, may hold promise as an
inflammatory bowel disease therapy. Prior work showed that a five-strain
fermented milk product (FMP) improved colitis in T-bet(-/-) Rag2(-/-) mice. By
varying the number of strains used in the FMP, we found that Lactococcus lactis
I-1631 was sufficient to ameliorate colitis. Using comparative genomic analyses, 
we identified genes unique to L. lactis I-1631 involved in oxygen respiration.
Respiration of oxygen results in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Also, 
ROS are produced at high levels during intestinal inflammation and cause tissue
damage. L. lactis I-1631 possesses genes encoding enzymes that detoxify ROS, such
as superoxide dismutase (SodA). Thus, we hypothesized that lactococcal SodA
played a role in attenuating colitis. Inactivation of the sodA gene abolished L. 
lactis I-1631's beneficial effect in the T-bet(-/-) Rag2(-/-) model. Similar
effects were obtained in two additional colonic inflammation models, Il10(-/-)
mice and dextran sulfate sodium-treated mice. Efforts to understand how a
lipophobic superoxide anion (O2 (-)) can be detoxified by cytoplasmic lactoccocal
SodA led to the finding that host antimicrobial-mediated lysis is a prerequisite 
for SodA release and SodA's extracytoplasmic O2 (-) scavenging. L. lactis I-1631 
may represent a promising vehicle to deliver antioxidant, colitis-attenuating
SodA to the inflamed intestinal mucosa, and host antimicrobials may play a
critical role in mediating SodA's bioaccessibility.

Autophagy is a protective and life-sustaining process in which cytoplasmic
components are packaged into double-membrane vesicles and targeted to lysosomes
for degradation. This process of cellular self-digestion is an essential stress
response and is cytoprotective by removing damaged organelles and proteins that
threaten the cell's survival. Key outcomes include energy generation and
recycling of metabolic precursors. In the immune system, autophagy regulates
processes such as antigen uptake and presentation, removal of pathogens, survival
of short- and long-lived immune cells, and cytokine-dependent inflammation. In
all cases, a window of optimal autophagic activity appears critical to balance
catabolic, reparative, and inflammation-inducing processes. Dysregulation of
autophagosome formation and autophagic flux can have deleterious consequences,
ranging from a failure to "clean house" to the induction of autophagy-induced
cell death. Abnormalities in the autophagic pathway have been implicated in
numerous autoimmune diseases. Genome-wide association studies have linked
polymorphisms in autophagy-related genes with predisposition for
tissue-destructive inflammatory disease, specifically in inflammatory bowel
disease and systemic lupus erythematosus. Although the precise mechanisms by
which dysfunctional autophagy renders the host susceptible to continuous
inflammation remain unclear, autophagy's role in regulating the long-term
survival of adaptive immune cells has recently surfaced as a defect in multiple
sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Efforts are underway to identify
autophagy-inducing and autophagy-suppressing pharmacologic interventions that can
be added to immunosuppressive therapy to improve outcomes of patients with
autoimmune disease.

PURPOSE: The microbiome modulates numerous aspects of human physiology and is a
crucial factor in the development of various human diseases. Vitamin D deficiency
and downregulation of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) are also associated with the
pathogenesis of diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, cancers, obesity,
diabetes, and asthma. VDR is a nuclear receptor that regulates the expression of 
antimicrobial peptides and autophagy regulator ATG16L1. Vitamin D may promote a
balanced intestinal microbiome and improve glucose homeostasis in diabetes.
However, how VDR regulates microbiome is not well known. In the current study, we
hypothesize that VDR status regulates the composition and functions of the
intestinal bacterial community.
METHODS: Fecal and cecal stool samples were harvested from Vdr knockout
(Vdr(-/-)) and wild-type mice for bacterial DNA and then sequenced with 454
pyrosequencing. The sequences were denoised and clustered into operational
taxonomic units, then queried against the National Center for Biotechnology
Information database. Metagenomics were analyzed, and the abundances of genes
involved in metabolic pathways were compared by reference to the Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and Clusters of Orthologous Groups databases.
FINDINGS: In the Vdr(-/-) mice, Lactobacillus was depleted in the fecal stool,
whereas Clostridium and Bacteroides were enriched. Bacterial taxa along the
Sphingobacteria-to-Sphingobacteriaceae lineage were enriched, but no genera
reached statistical significance. In the cecal stool, Alistipes and Odoribacter
were depleted, and Eggerthella was enriched. Notably, all of the taxa upstream of
Eggerthella remained unchanged. A comparison of Vdr(-/-) and wild-type samples
revealed 40 (26 enriched, 14 depleted) and 72 (41 enriched, 31 depleted)
functional modules that were significantly altered in the cecal and fecal
microbiomes, respectively (both, P < 0.05), due to the loss of Vdr. In addition
to phylogenetic differences in gut microbiome with different intestinal origins, 
we identify several important pathways, such as nucleotide-binding
oligomerization domain-like receptor, affected by Vdr status, including amino
acid, carbohydrate, and fatty acid synthesis and metabolism, detoxification,
infections, signal transduction, and cancer and other diseases.
IMPLICATIONS: Our study fills knowledge gaps by having investigated the microbial
profile affected by VDR. Insights from our findings can be exploited to develop
novel strategies to treat or prevent various diseases by restoring VDR function
and healthy microbe-host interactions.

Data on prevalence and phenotypic consequences of nucleotide-binding
oligomerisation domain 2/caspase recruitment domains 15 (NOD2/CARD15) variants in
Crohn's disease (CD) population in Poland and Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&amp;H)
are nonexistent. We aimed to determine the prevalence of NOD2/CARD15 mutations
and their association with disease phenotype in Polish and Bosnian patients with 
CD and in healthy controls. We prospectively recruited 86 CD patients and 83
controls in Poland and 30 CD patients and 30 controls in B&amp;H, 229 in total.
We determined the prevalence of NOD2/CARD15 mutations and their association with 
the disease phenotype according to Montreal classification. Participants were
genotyped for Leu1007fsinsC and Gly908Arg mutations. At least one CD-associated
allele was found in 29/86 (33.7%) of Polish CD patients and in 9/83 (10.8%) of
healthy controls (p&lt;0.001). In both CD patients and controls in Bosnian
sample, at least one NOD2 mutation was found in equal number of patients (3/30;
10%) with all of the NOD2 mutation positive CD patients being homozygous, while
controls being heterozygous. In Polish sample, perianal disease was less frequent
in CD patients with any NOD2 mutation (1/21; 4.8%) compared to those without
(11/41; 26.8%; p=0.046). Higher percentage of patients with NOD2 mutations had
history of CD related surgery when compared with those without mutations (66.7%
vs. 43.3%; p=0.05). The risk for CD is increased in patients with NOD2 mutations 
(Poland) and especially in the presence of homozygous NOD2 mutations (Poland and 
Bosnia). The presence of variant NOD2 alleles is associated with increased need
for surgery and reduced occurrence of perianal disease.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, relapsing and debilitating idiopathic
inflammation, with variable and complex pathophysiologies. Our objective was to
elucidate patterns of gene expression underlying the progression of UC disease.
Single endoscopic pinch FFPE biopsies (n = 41) were sampled at both active and
inactive stages at the same site in individual UC patients and compared with each
other and with non-inflammatory bowel disease healthy controls. Gene expression
results were validated by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (QRT-PCR), and
results at the protein level were validated by immunohistochemistry and western
blot. Analysis of microarray results demonstrated that UC patients in remission
display an intermediate gene expression phenotype between active UC patients and 
controls. It is clear that UC active site recovery does not revert fully back to 
a healthy control phenotype. Both UC active and inactive tissue displayed
evidence, at both the gene expression and protein level, of a positive
precancerous state as indicated by increases in the expression of Chitinase
3-Like-1, and the colorectal cancer metastasis marker MMP1. A key distinguishing 
feature between active and inactive UC, however, was the mobilization of marker
genes and proteins for the Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) pathway only
in active UC. Analysis of the gene expression signatures associated with UC
remission identified multiple pathways which appear to be permanently
dysregulated in UC patients at formerly active sites in spite of clear
histological recovery. Among these pathways, the EMT pathway was specifically
up-regulated only in active UC emphasizing the potential for cancer progression
in these patients.

Canine protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) is associated with severe
gastrointestinal disorders and has a guarded to poor prognosis although little
information is available regarding factors affecting prognosis. The purpose of
this study was to identify the prognostic factors for survival of dogs with PLE. 
Ninety-two dogs diagnosed with PLE from 2006 to 2011 were included in a
retrospective cohort study. Survival analysis was performed using the
Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Variables recorded at the time of
diagnosis were statistically analysed for possible prognostic factors in a
univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard model. In the multivariate
analysis, the predictors for mortality in dogs with PLE were more highly scored
in terms of canine inflammatory bowel disease activity index (CIBDAI)
(P = 0.0003), clonal rearrangement of lymphocyte antigen receptor genes
(P = 0.003), and elevation of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (P = 0.03). Using
histopathological diagnosis, both small- and large-cell lymphomas were associated
with significantly shorter survival times than chronic enteritis (CE) and
intestinal lymphangiectasia (IL). Normalization of CIBDAI and plasma albumin
concentration within 50 days of initial treatment was associated with a longer
survival time. In conclusion, CIBDAI, clonal rearrangement of lymphocyte antigen 
receptor genes, histopathological diagnosis, and response to initial treatments
would be valuable in separating the underlying causes and could be important in
predicting prognosis in dogs with PLE.

To functionally link coronary artery disease (CAD) causal genes identified by
genome wide association studies (GWAS), and to investigate the cellular and
molecular mechanisms of atherosclerosis, we have used chromatin
immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) with the CAD associated transcription
factor TCF21 in human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASMC). Analysis of
identified TCF21 target genes for enrichment of molecular and cellular annotation
terms identified processes relevant to CAD pathophysiology, including "growth
factor binding," "matrix interaction," and "smooth muscle contraction." We
characterized the canonical binding sequence for TCF21 as CAGCTG, identified AP-1
binding sites in TCF21 peaks, and by conducting ChIP-Seq for JUN and JUND in
HCASMC confirmed that there is significant overlap between TCF21 and AP-1 binding
loci in this cell type. Expression quantitative trait variation mapped to target 
genes of TCF21 was significantly enriched among variants with low P-values in the
GWAS analyses, suggesting a possible functional interaction between TCF21 binding
and causal variants in other CAD disease loci. Separate enrichment analyses found
over-representation of TCF21 target genes among CAD associated genes, and linkage
disequilibrium between TCF21 peak variation and that found in GWAS loci,
consistent with the hypothesis that TCF21 may affect disease risk through
interaction with other disease associated loci. Interestingly, enrichment for
TCF21 target genes was also found among other genome wide association phenotypes,
including height and inflammatory bowel disease, suggesting a functional profile 
important for basic cellular processes in non-vascular tissues. Thus, data and
analyses presented here suggest that study of GWAS transcription factors may be a
highly useful approach to identifying disease gene interactions and thus pathways
that may be relevant to complex disease etiology.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a type of inflammatory bowel disease and is considered
a chronic gastrointestinal disorder. Igongsan (IGS) is a Korean herbal medicine, 
which has been used to treat digestive disorders. However, the ameliorative
effect and molecular mechanisms of IGS in intestinal inflammation have not yet
been studied in detail. The present study aimed to investigate the protective
effects of IGS and its constituent, ergosterol, in a mouse model of dextran
sulfate sodium (DSS)‑induced colitis. Colitis was induced in mice by
supplementing their drinking water with 5% (w/v) DSS for 7 days. The effects of
IGS were then determined on DSS‑induced clinical signs of colitis, including
weight loss, colon shortening, diarrhea and obscure/gross bleeding. In addition, 
the effects of IGS were determined on the expression levels of
inflammation‑associated genes in the colon tissue of DSS‑treated mice. The
results of the present study demonstrated that mice treated with DSS exhibited
marked clinical symptoms, including weight loss and reduced colon length.
Treatment with IGS attenuated these symptoms and also suppressed the expression
levels of tumor necrosis factor‑α and interleukin‑6, as well as the expression of
cyclooxygenase‑2 in the colon tissue of DSS‑treated mice. IGS also reduced the
activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor‑κB p65 in the colon tissue 
of DSS‑treated mice. In addition, ergosterol was shown to attenuate the
DSS‑induced clinical symptoms of colitis in mice. In conclusion, the present
study provided experimental evidence that IGS may be a useful therapeutic drug
for patients with UC.

Campylobacter concisus is an oral bacterium that has been shown to be associated 
with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In this study we examined clusters of oral
C. concisus strains isolated from patients with IBD and healthy controls by
analysing six housekeeping genes. In addition, we investigated the population
structure of C. concisus strains. Whether oral and enteric strains form distinct 
clusters based on the sequences of these housekeeping genes was also
investigated. The oral C. concisus strains were found to contain two
genomospecies, which belong to the two genomospecies previously found in enteric 
C. concisus strains. C. concisus clusters formed based on the sequences of a
single aspA gene were the same as that formed by using previously reported MLST
schemes. The analysis of combined oral and enteric C. concisus strains found that
enteric C. concisus strains did not form distinct clusters. Genetic structure
analysis identified five subpopulations of C. concisus and showed that genetic
recombination between C. concisus strains was common. However, genetic
recombination was significantly less in oral strains isolated from patients with 
IBD than from healthy individuals. Previously reported oral and enteric
intestinal epithelial invasive C. concisus strains were in cluster II and
subpopulation III. Furthermore, this study shows that there are no distinct
enteric C. concisus strain clusters or subpopulations.

Previous studies have highlighted the role of genetic predispositions in disease,
and several genes had been identified as important in Crohn's disease (CD).
However, many of these genes are likely rare and not associated with
susceptibility in Chinese CD patients. We found 294 shared identical variants in 
the CD patients of which 26 were validated by Sanger sequencing. Two heterozygous
IFN variants (IFNA10 c.60 T > A; IFNA4 c.60 A > T) were identified as
significantly associated with CD susceptibility. The single-nucleotide changes
alter a cysteine situated before the signal peptide cleavage site to a stop code 
(TGA) in IFNA10 result in the serum levels of IFNA10 were significantly decreased
in the CD patients compared to the controls. Furthermore, the IFNA10 and IFNA4
mutants resulted in an impairment of the suppression of HCV RNA replication in
HuH7 cells, and the administration of the recombinant IFN subtypes restored
DSS-induced colonic inflammation through the upregulation of CD4(+) Treg cells.
We identified heterozygous IFNA10 and IFNA4 variants as a cause of impaired
function and CD susceptibility genes in Chinese patients from multiple center
based study. These findings might provide clues in the understanding of the
genetic heterogeneity of CD and lead to better screening and improved treatment.

Vitamin D deficiency has been recognized as an environmental risk factor for
Crohn's disease since the early 80s. Initially, this finding was correlated with 
metabolic bone disease. Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels have been repeatedly
reported in inflammatory bowel diseases together with a relationship between
vitamin D status and disease activity. Subsequently, low serum vitamin D levels
have been reported in various immune-related diseases pointing to an
immunoregulatory role. Indeed, vitamin D and its receptor (VDR) are known to
interact with different players of the immune homeostasis by controlling cell
proliferation, antigen receptor signalling, and intestinal barrier function.
Moreover, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is implicated in NOD2-mediated expression of
defensin-β2, the latter known to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of
Crohn's disease (IBD1 gene), and several genetic variants of the vitamin D
receptor have been identified as Crohn's disease candidate susceptibility genes. 
From animal models we have learned that deletion of the VDR gene was associated
with a more severe disease. There is a growing body of evidence concerning the
therapeutic role of vitamin D/synthetic vitamin D receptor agonists in clinical
and experimental models of inflammatory bowel disease far beyond the role of
calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism.

BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies have identified tumor necrosis factor
superfamily member 15 (TNFSF15) as a Crohn's disease (CD)-related gene. The aim
of this study was to evaluate the association between five TNFSF15 polymorphisms 
and CD in Korean children and analyze their genotypes in relation to phenotype.
METHODS: Five single-nucleotide polymorphisms of TNFSF15 (rs3810936, rs6478108,
rs6478109, rs7848647, rs7865494) were genotyped in 108 CD patients and in 599
healthy controls. Risk allele, genotype, and haplotype were analyzed in CD
patients and controls, and genotype-phenotype relationships were studied.
RESULTS: There were significant associations of rs3810936, rs6478108, rs6478109, 
rs7848647 with CD in Korean pediatric patients (P = 6.5×10(-8), P = 1.3×10(-8), P
= 3.7×10(-8), P = 2.9×10(-8), respectively). The adjusted OR (aOR) for the
homozygous risk allele genotype was significantly higher than that for the
homozygous genotype for the opposite allele: rs3810936, aOR, 5.36 (95%CI:
2.61-10.98, P = 4.6×10(-6)); rs6478108, aOR, 6.62 (95%CI: 3.03-14.46, P =
2.2×10(-6)); rs6478109, aOR, 6.24 (95%CI: 2.85-13.66, P = 4.6×10(-6)); rs7848647,
aOR, 6.32 (95%CI: 2.89-13.81, P = 3.8×10(-6)). The risk allele of rs3810936 was
associated with later symptom onset, later diagnosis, and the presence of
perianal lesion (P = 0.013, P = 0.016 and P = 0.029).
CONCLUSION: There was a significant association of TNFSF15 with pediatric CD in
Korean patients.

INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression of Wnt 
and Notch signaling pathway-related genes in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
treated with mesenchymal stem cell transplantation (MSCT).
METHODS: TNBS (2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid) was used to establish IBD in 
a rat model. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were transplanted via tail vein
transfusion. Saline water was used in a control group. The expression of Wnt and 
Notch main signaling molecules was screened by gene chips and verified by
quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in the IBD rat model
on day 14 and day 28 after transplantation.
RESULTS: The IBD rat models were successfully established and MSCs were
transplanted into those models. Genome-wide expression profile chips identified a
total of 388 differentially expressive genes, of which 191 were upregulated and
197 were downregulated in the MSC-transplanted group in comparison with the IBD
control group. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction results showed
that the level of Olfm4 mRNA expression in the IBD group (2.54±0.20) was
significantly increased compared with the MSCT group (1.39±0.54) and the normal
group (1.62±0.25) (P <0.05). The Wnt3a mRNA was more highly expressed in IBD rats
(2.92±0.94) and decreased in MSCT rats (0.17±0.63, P <0.05). The expression of
GSK-3β mRNA was decreased in the setting of inflammation (0.65±0.04 versus
1.00±0.01 in normal group, P <0.05) but returned to normal levels after MSCT
(0.81±0.17). The expression of β-catenin was observed to increase in IBD tissues 
(1.76±0.44) compared with normal tissues (1.00±0.01, P <0.05), but no difference 
was found in the MSCT group (1.12±0.36). Wnt11 declined at 14 days and returned
to normal levels at 28 days in the IBD group; in comparison, a significantly
lower expression was found in MSCT rats. There were no differences in the
expression of Fzd3, c-myc, TCF4, and Wnt5a in inflammation, but all of those
genes declined after MSCT treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: The canonical Wnt and Notch signaling pathways are activated in IBD 
and may be suppressed by stem cell transplantation to differentiate into
intestinal epithelium after MSCT. Moreover, the non-canonical Wnt signaling may
be inhibited by canonical Wnt signaling in the setting of inflammation and may
also be suppressed by MSCT.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms underlying
the therapeutic effect of Uygur medicine KJA on UC in a rat model.
METHODS: UC was induced in Wistar rats by application of 2,
4-dinitrochlorobenzene and acetic acid and were then treated with three different
doses of KJA, and normal saline as control. After treatment for 20 days, the gene
expression profile of colonic tissue was analyzed by microarray and verified by
quantitative real-time RT-PCR.
RESULTS: Animals treated with the three different doses of KJA were compared with
normal saline controls, wherein microarray analysis identified 1991, 2163, and
1677 differentially expressed genes respectively, of which 444 genes were raised 
and 670 genes were decrease spliced together in the three doses tested. The KEGG 
pathway analyses found commonly raised genes related to several different
biological functions. Interesting genes included TRL2, IL-1β, TGF-β1, and NF-κB
were confirmed by quantitative PCR.
CONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic effect of KJA on UC is likely explained by specific 
effects on the expression of genes, which are the effector molecules known to be 
involved in the development of UC. Further studies on differentially expressed
genes will help explain the mechanism of action of Uygur medicine KJA.

Although aberrant microRNA (miRNA) expression has frequently been observed in
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), its biological functions and targets remain
largely unknown. Present study found that miR-19b was significantly downregulated
in active Crohn's disease (CD). Using bioinformatics analysis, suppressor of
cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3), a physiological regulator of innate and adaptive
immunity that controls several immuno-inflammatory diseases, was predicted to be 
a potential target of miR-19b. An inverse correlation between miR-19b and SOCS3
protein levels, but not mRNA, was identified in active-CD intestinal tissue
samples. By overexpressing or knocking down miR-19b in Caco2 cells and HT29
cells, it was experimentally validated that miR-19b is a direct regulator of
SOCS3. Using a luciferase reporter assay, it was confirmed that miR-19b directly 
recognizes the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of SOCS3. Furthermore,
overexpression of miR-19b decreased SOCS3 expression, leading to increased
production of macrophage-inflammatory protein-3α (MIP-3α) in Caco2 cells. In
contrast, knockdown of miR-19b increased SOCS3 and decreased MIP-3α. Finally,
intracolonically delivered miR-19b decreased the severity of colitis induced with
2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS). Taken together, our findings suggest
that miR-19b suppresses the inflammatory response by inhibiting SOCS3 to modulate
chemokine production in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and thereby prevents
the pathogenesis of CD.

Inflammatory immune disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease and multiple
sclerosis are major health problems. Currently, the intestinal whipworm Trichuris
suis is being explored in clinical trials to reduce inflammation in these
diseases; however, the mechanisms by which the parasite affects the host immune
system are not known. Here we determined the effects of T. suis soluble products 
(SPs) on Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4)-stimulated human dendritic cells (DCs) using
Illumina bead chip gene arrays. Pathway analysis of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated
DCs with or without T. suis treatment showed that co-stimulation with T. suis SPs
resulted in a downregulation of both the myeloid differentiation primary response
gene 88-dependent and the TIR-domain-containing adaptor-inducing
interferon-β-dependent signalling pathways triggered by TLR4. These data were
verified using quantitative real-time PCR of several key genes within these
pathways and/or defining their protein levels. In addition, T. suis SPs induce
Rab7b, a negative regulator of TLR4 signalling that interferes with its
trafficking, which coincided with a reduced surface expression of TLR4. These
data indicate that the mechanism by which T. suis SPs reduce inflammatory
responses is through suppression of both TLR4 signalling and surface expression
on DCs.

Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) and adherent-invasive
Escherichia coli (AIEC) have been implicated as primary triggers in Crohn's
disease (CD). In this study, we evaluated the prevalence of MAP and E. coli (EC) 
DNA in peripheral blood from 202 inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients at
various disease periods and compared against 24 cirrhotic patients with ascites
(CIR) (non-IBD controls) and 29 healthy controls (HC). MAP DNA was detected by
IS900-specific nested PCR, EC DNA by malB-specific nested PCR and AIEC identity, 
in selected samples, by sequencing of fimH gene. CD patients with active disease 
showed the highest MAP DNA prevalence among IBD patients (68 %). Infliximab
treatment resulted in decreased MAP detection. CIR patients had high individual
and coinfection rates (75 % MAP, 88 % EC and 67 % MAP and EC), whilst HC controls
had lower MAP prevalence (38 %) and EC was undetectable in this control group. EC
DNA prevalence in IBD patients was highly associated with CD, and 80 % of EC from
the selected samples of CD patients analyzed carried the fimH30 allele, with a
mutation strongly associated with AIEC. Our results show that coinfection with
MAP and AIEC is common and persistent in CD, although the high MAP and EC
detection in CIR patients suggested that colonization is, at least, partially
dependent on increased gut permeability. Nevertheless, facilitative mechanisms
between a susceptible host and these two potential human pathogens may allow
their implication in CD pathogenesis.

BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a complex multi-factorial
inflammatory disease with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) being 
the two most common forms. A number of transcriptional profiling studies have
provided compelling evidence that describe the role of protein-coding genes and
microRNAs in modulating the immune responses in IBD.
METHODS: In the present study, we performed a genome-wide transcriptome profiling
of lncRNAs and protein-coding genes in 96 colon pinch biopsies (inflamed and
non-inflamed) extracted from multiple colonic locations from 45 patients (CD =
13, UC = 20, controls = 12) using an expression microarray platform.
RESULTS: In our study, we identified widespread dysregulation of lncRNAs and
protein-coding genes in both inflamed and non-inflamed CD and UC compared to the 
healthy controls. In cases of inflamed CD and UC, we identified 438 and 745
differentially expressed lncRNAs, respectively, while in cases of the
non-inflamed CD and UC, we identified 12 and 19 differentially expressed lncRNAs,
respectively. We also observed significant enrichment (P-value <0.001, Pearson's 
Chi-squared test) for 96 differentially expressed lncRNAs and 154 protein-coding 
genes within the IBD susceptibility loci. Furthermore, we found strong positive
expression correlations for the intersecting and cis-neighboring differentially
expressed IBD loci-associated lncRNA-protein-coding gene pairs. The functional
annotation analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed their involvement 
in the immune response, pro-inflammatory cytokine activity and MHC protein
complex.
CONCLUSIONS: The lncRNA expression profiling in both inflamed and non-inflamed CD
and UC successfully stratified IBD patients from the healthy controls. Taken
together, the identified lncRNA transcriptional signature along with clinically
relevant parameters suggest their potential as biomarkers in IBD.

Biomarkers of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are non-invasive or minimally
invasive tests for IBD diagnosis and/or prognosis as well as assessment of
disease activity and response to therapy. Here, we update the current status of
IBD biomarkers, including serological, fecal, and genetic (DNA and microRNA
[miRNA]) biomarkers. As an update, the classical serological biomarkers,
including ASCA, pANCA, anti-OmpC, anti-Cbir, anti-I2, and other anti-glycan
antibodies, are discussed only briefly. Emphasis in this article is given to
those that have been recently identified or extensively characterized, as well as
to the clinical utilities of biomarkers, with special attention to prediction of 
disease complication and activity assessment, mucosal healing, and response to
therapies. In particular, we discuss the utilities of blood-based biomarkers
predicting therapeutic response to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, such as
anti-anti-TNFα antibodies or anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and trough level of
anti-TNFα. Fecal biomarkers, which have recently attracted substantial attention,
are also discussed extensively, including the well-characterized calprotectin and
lactoferrin, as well as the recently characterized M2-PK, CHI3L1, neopterin,
MMP-9, and HMGB1. Genome and exome sequencing enables the discovery of a number
of rare yet disease-defining IBD-susceptible genes, particularly those involved
in very early onset IBD, providing rare yet extremely useful biomarkers at
genetic levels for IBD diagnosis/prognosis. Finally, we briefly summarize the
discovery, characterization, and potential implications of miRNA as potential IBD
biomarkers.

Pregnane X receptor (PXR) activation exhibits anti-inflammatory effects via
repressing nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB); however, its overactivation may disrupt
homeostasis of various enzymes and transporters. Here we found that ginsenosides 
restore PXR/NF-κB signaling in inflamed conditions without disrupting PXR
function in normal conditions. The effects and mechanisms of ginsenosides in
regulating PXR/NF-κB signals were determined both in vitro and in vivo.
Ginsenosides significantly inhibited NF-κB activation and restored the expression
of PXR target genes in tumor necrosis factor-α-stimulated LS174T cells. Despite
not being PXR agonists, ginsenosides repressed NF-κB activation in a
PXR-dependent manner. Ginsenosides significantly increased the physical
association between PXR and the NF-κB p65 subunit and thereby decreased the
nuclear translocation of p65. Ginsenoside Rb1 and compound K (CK) were major
bioactive compounds in the regulating PXR/NF-κB signaling. Consistently,
ginsenosides significantly attenuated dextran sulfate sodium-induced experimental
colitis, which was associated with restored PXR/NF-κB signaling. This study
indicates that ginsenosides may elicit anti-inflammatory effects via targeting
PXR/NF-κB interaction without disrupting PXR function in healthy conditions.
Ginsenoside Rb1 and CK may serve as leading compounds in the discovery of new
drugs that target PXR/NF-κB interaction in therapy for inflammatory bowel
disease.

INTRODUCTION: Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a progressive cholestatic
disorder that ultimately can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, malignancy and
death. It is strongly associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and
though a rare disease, its incidence is increasing. There are no proven medical
therapies for PSC.
SOURCES OF DATA: Ovid Medline was utilised to search for articles with keywords
'sclerosing cholangitis' and 'cholangiocarcinoma' and containing titles 'primary 
sclerosing cholangitis', and references of these papers were cross-referenced for
further relevant manuscripts.
AREAS OF AGREEMENT: PSC is a rare disease, and there is a strong association with
risk loci within the major histocompatibility complex and other genes common to
other autoimmune diseases. PSC is a premalignant condition, associated with
higher rates of hepatobiliary and colorectal cancer in patients with ulcerative
colitis (UC).
AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: The pathogenesis is unclear, and competing theories exist
surrounding toxic bile acids, enhanced homing of particular T cells from the gut 
to the liver and increased passage of toxins to the liver through a permeable
bowel wall. It is unclear whether the higher rate of colonic cancer in PSC/UC
occurs in PSC/Crohn's disease. Ursodeoxycholic acid therapy reduces liver enzymes
but has not been shown to improve survival. It may reduce the prevalence of bowel
cancer.
GROWING POINTS: Recent genetic studies have revealed new risk loci, pointing to
the importance of the immune system and its interaction with the biome.
AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: On the basis of the genetic studies
discussed earlier, novel agents are being developed and trialled in the treatment
of PSC.

Two main features common to all solid tumors are tissue hypoxia and inflammation,
both of which cause tumor progression, metastasis, therapy resistance and
increased mortality. Chronic inflammation is associated with increased cancer
risk, as demonstrated for inflammatory bowel disease patients developing colon
cancer. However, the interplay between hypoxia and inflammation on the molecular 
level remains to be elucidated. We found that MC-38 mouse colon cancer cells
contain functional hypoxic (HIF-1α) and inflammatory (p65/RelA) signaling
pathways. In contrast to cells of the myeloid lineage, HIF-1α levels remained
unaffected in MC-38 cells treated with LPS, and hypoxia failed to induce NF-κB. A
similar regulation of canonical HIF and NF-κB target genes confirmed these
results. RNA deep sequencing of HIF-1α and p65/RelA knock-down cells revealed
that a surprisingly large fraction of HIF target genes required p65/RelA for
hypoxic regulation and a number of p65/RelA target genes required HIF-1α for
proinflammatory regulation, respectively. Hypoxia attenuated the inflammatory
response to LPS by inhibiting nuclear translocation of p65/RelA independently of 
HIF-1α, which was associated with enhanced IκBα levels and decreased IKKβ
phosphorylation. These data demonstrate that the interaction between hypoxic and 
inflammatory signaling pathways needs to be considered when designing cancer
therapies targeting HIF or NF-κB.

BACKGROUND: Previous research has yielded conflicting data as to whether the
natural history of inflammatory bowel disease follows a seasonal pattern. The
purpose of this study was (1) to determine whether the frequency of onset and
relapse of inflammatory bowel disease follows a seasonal pattern and (2) to
establish a model to predict the frequency of onset, relapse, and severity of
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with meteorological data based on artificial
neural network (ANN).
METHOD: Patients with diagnosis of ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease
(CD) between 2003 and 2011 were investigated according to the occurrence of onset
and flares of symptoms. The expected onset or relapse was calculated on a monthly
basis over the study period. For artificial neural network (ANN), patients from
2003 to 2010 were assigned as training cohort and patients in 2011 were assigned 
as validation cohort. Mean square error (MSE) and mean absolute percentage error 
(MAPE) were used to evaluate the predictive accuracy.
RESULTS: We found no seasonal pattern of onset (P = 0.248) and relapse
(P = 0.394) among UC patients. But, the onset (P = 0.015) and relapse (P = 0.004)
of CD were associated with seasonal pattern, with a peak in July and August. ANN 
had average accuracy to predict the frequency of onset (MSE = 0.076,
MAPE = 37.58%) and severity of IBD (MSE = 0.065, MAPE = 42.15%) but high accuracy
in predicting the frequency of relapse of IBD (MSE = 0.009, MAPE = 17.1%).
CONCLUSION: The frequency of onset and relapse in IBD showed seasonality only in 
CD, with a peak in July and August, but not in UC. ANN may have its value in
predicting the frequency of relapse among patients with IBD.

Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are a family of immune cells that selectively
accumulate in mucosal tissues serving as sentinels at the vanguard of host
protective immunity. However, they are also implicated as cellular mediators of
immune-mediated diseases, most notably IBD. ILCs are subdivided into distinct
lineages based on the expression of effector cytokines and master transcription
factors that programme their differentiation and inflammatory behaviour.
Strikingly, these subsets closely resemble CD4(+) T-cell lineages, including T
helper (TH)1, TH2 and TH17 cells that are similarly implicated in immune-mediated
diseases. However, ILCs that promote the maintenance of intestinal epithelial
cells, mostly through production of IL-22, also exist. ILCs rapidly respond to
environmental cues, including cytokines, metabolic signals and luminal bacteria. 
They are potent and immediate producers of key cytokines linked to IBD
pathogenesis, including TNF, IL-17, IL-22 and IFN-γ. Some subsets are implicated 
as mediators of chronic intestinal inflammation, whereas others might provide
protective functions. They are present in the gut of patients with IBD and,
intriguingly, closer scrutiny of IBD susceptibility loci shows that many of these
genes are either expressed by, or are intimately linked to, ILC function. Looking
forward, targeting ILCs could represent a new IBD treatment paradigm.

Segmental duplications (SDs) comprise about 5% of the human genome and are
enriched for immune genes. SD loci often show copy numbers variations (CNV),
which are difficult to tag with genotyping methods. CNV in the Fcγ receptor
region (FCGR) has been suggested to be associated with rheumatic diseases. The
objective of this study was to delineate association of FCGR-CNV with rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA), coeliac disease and Inflammatory bowel disease incidence. We
developed a method to accurately quantify CNV in SD loci based on the intensity
values from the Immunochip platform and applied it to the FCGR locus. We
determined the method's validity using three independent assays: segregation
analysis in families, arrayCGH, and whole genome sequencing. Our data showed the 
presence of two separate CNVs in the FCGR locus. The first region encodes FCGR2A,
FCGR3A and part of FCGR2C gene, the second encodes another part of FCGR2C, FCGR3B
and FCGR2B. Analysis of CNV status in 4578 individuals with RA and 5457 controls 
indicated association of duplications in the FCGR3B gene in antibody-negative RA 
(P=0.002, OR=1.43). Deletion in FCGR3B was associated with increased risk of
antibody-positive RA, consistently with previous reports (P=0.023, OR=1.23). A
clear genotype-phenotype relationship was observed: CNV polymorphisms of the
FCGR3A gene correlated to CD16A expression (encoded by FCGR3A) on CD8 T-cells. In
conclusion, our method allows determining the CNV status of the FCGR locus, we
identified association of CNV in FCGR3B to RA and showed a functional
relationship between CNV in the FCGR3A gene and CD16A expression.

Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a malignant tumour of bile duct epithelial cells with
dismal prognosis and rising incidence. Chronic inflammation resulting from liver 
fluke infection, hepatitis and other inflammatory bowel diseases is a major
contributing factor to cholangiocarcinogenesis, likely through accumulation of
serial genetic and epigenetic alterations resulting in aberration of oncogenes
and tumour suppressors. Recent studies making use of advances in high-throughput 
genomics have revealed the genetic landscape of CCA, greatly increasing our
understanding of its underlying biology. A series of highly recurrent mutations
in genes such as TP53, KRAS, SMAD4, BRAF, MLL3, ARID1A, PBRM1 and BAP1, which are
known to be involved in cell cycle control, cell signalling pathways and
chromatin dynamics, have led to investigations of their roles, through molecular 
to mouse modelling studies, in cholangiocarcinogenesis. This review focuses on
the landscape genetic alterations in CCA and its functional relevance to the
formation and progression of CCA.

The NOD2 gene plays a fundamental role in initiating the inflammatory and
subsequent immune response. NOD2 was previously identified as a susceptibility
locus for inflammatory bowel diseases in humans. In this study, we detected 2
mutations in exon 12 (A→T, G→A) among 5 cattle breeds (N = 315) and analyzed
their associations with production traits and genetic resistance against bovine
mastitis in Chinese Holstein and Chinese Simmental breeds (N = 218). The
transitions (A→T) at position 114 bp were associated with somatic cell score (P <
0.01). The G→A at position 1594 bp plays a critical role in increasing 305-day
milk yields. In Chinese Holstein and Chinese Simmental breeds, the BB genotype
may contribute to disease susceptibility. Compared to all genotypic combinations,
the A, B, and FF genotypes are beneficial not only for reducing somatic cell
score but also for increasing production.

Although different autoimmune diseases show discrete clinical features, there are
common molecular pathways intimately involved. Here we show that miR-125a is
downregulated in peripheral CD4(+) T cells of human autoimmune diseases including
systemic lupus erythematosus and Crohn's disease, and relevant autoimmune mouse
models. miR-125a stabilizes both the commitment and immunoregulatory capacity of 
Treg cells. In miR-125a-deficient mice, the balance appears to shift from immune 
suppression to inflammation, and results in more severe pathogenesis of colitis
and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The genome-wide target
analysis reveals that miR-125a suppresses several effector T-cell factors
including Stat3, Ifng and Il13. Using a chemically synthesized miR-125a analogue,
we show potential to re-programme the immune homeostasis in EAE models. These
findings point to miR-125a as a critical factor that controls autoimmune diseases
by stabilizing Treg-mediated immune homeostasis.

BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and
ulcerative colitis (UC), are characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation due
to immunological, microbial, and environmental factors in genetically predisposed
individuals. Advances in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of IBD require
the identification of robust biomarkers that can be used for molecular
classification of diverse disease presentations. We previously identified five
genes, RELA, TNFAIP3 (A20), PIGR, TNF, and IL8, whose mRNA levels in colonic
mucosal biopsies could be used in a multivariate analysis to classify patients
with CD based on disease behavior and responses to therapy.
AIM: We compared expression of these five biomarkers in IBD patients classified
as having CD or UC, and in healthy controls.
RESULTS: Patients with CD were characterized as having decreased median
expression of TNFAIP3, PIGR, and TNF in non-inflamed colonic mucosa as compared
to healthy controls. By contrast, UC patients exhibited decreased expression of
PIGR and elevated expression of IL8 in colonic mucosa compared to healthy
controls. A multivariate analysis combining mRNA levels for all five genes
resulted in segregation of individuals based on disease presentation (CD vs. UC) 
as well as severity, i.e., patients in remission versus those with acute colitis 
at the time of biopsy.
CONCLUSION: We propose that this approach could be used as a model for molecular 
classification of IBD patients, which could further be enhanced by the inclusion 
of additional genes that are identified by functional studies, global gene
expression analyses, and genome-wide association studies.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the genetic
polymorphisms of the autophagy-associated genes autophagy-related 16-like 1
(ATG16L1), immunity-related GTPase M (IRGM), Unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1), and
NOD2 with respect to early-onset Crohn disease (CD) among Korean children.
METHODS: A total of 65 patients with CD from the Seoul National University
Children's Hospital, from January 2000 to May 2012, and 72 unaffected controls
were selected. Twelve different single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were
analyzed (TaqMan assay: ATG16L1 rs2241880, IRGM SNPs [rs13361189, rs4958847,
rs1000113, rs10065172, and rs72553867], ULK1 SNPs [rs12303764, rs10902469, and
rs7488085], NOD2 SNPs [Arg702Trp and Gly908Arg]; direct sequencing: NOD2
leu1007fsinsC). The onset age of patients was 8.6 ± 4.7 years. Twelve patients
(18.5%) had an onset age of <1 year.
RESULTS: Two of the 12 SNPs showed significant results. IRGM rs1000113 exhibited 
an association with CD with respect to its minor allele frequency (odds ratio
[OR] 1.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-2.79, P = 0.03) and genotype
distribution (dominant model: OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.07-4.39, P = 0.03). IRGM
rs72553867 exhibited association with CD with respect to its minor allele
frequency (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.27-0.91, P = 0.02) and genotype distribution
(dominant model: OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.23-0.94, P = 0.03). The 3 SNPs of NOD2 existed
only as wild types for both groups. In the genotype-phenotype analysis, the onset
age, disease location, and disease behavior exhibited no association.
CONCLUSIONS: IRGM rs1000113 and IRGM rs72553867 exhibited associations with
early-onset CD as risk loci and defense loci, respectively. This suggests that
the autophagy pathway plays an important role in early-onset CD.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore whether polymorphisms of
intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) are associated with susceptibility to 
Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).
METHODS: The authors conducted a meta-analysis on the associations between the
polymorphisms K469E and G241R of ICAM-1 and susceptibility to CD and UC.
RESULTS: A total of 8 studies with 801 patients with CD, 672 patients with UC,
and 1,828 controls were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis revealed
no association between CD and the ICAM-1 469E allele among the subjects
(OR = 1.175, 95% CI = 0.901-1.533, p = 0.233). However, stratification by
ethnicity indicated an association between the ICAM-1 469E allele and CD in
Europeans (OR = 1.425, 95% CI = 1.013-2.002, p = 0.042). Meta-analysis using the 
homozygosity also showed an association with CD in Europeans (OR = 2.054, 95%
CI = 1.036-4.073, p = 0.039). The meta-analysis revealed no association between
UC and the ICAM-1 K469E polymorphism. No association between CD or UC and the
ICAM-1 G241R polymorphism was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis demonstrates that the ICAM-1 K469E polymorphism
may be associated with susceptibility to CD in Europeans, but no association was 
found between ICAM-1 K469E and UC. In contrast, the G241R polymorphism was not
found to be associated with susceptibility to either CD or UC.

Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have led to the reliable
identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at a number of loci
associated with increased risk of specific common human diseases. Each such locus
implicates multiple possible candidate SNPs for involvement in disease mechanism.
A variety of mechanisms may link the presence of an SNP to altered in vivo gene
product function and hence contribute to disease risk. Here, we report an
analysis of the role of one of these mechanisms, missense SNPs (msSNPs) in
proteins in seven complex trait diseases. Linkage disequilibrium information was 
used to identify possible candidate msSNPs associated with increased disease risk
at each of 356 loci for the seven diseases. Two computational methods were used
to estimate which of these SNPs has a significant impact on in vivo protein
function. 69% of the loci have at least one candidate msSNP and 33% have at least
one predicted high-impact msSNP. In some cases, these SNPs are in
well-established disease-related proteins, such as MST1 (macrophage stimulating
1) for Crohn's disease. In others, they are in proteins identified by GWAS as
likely candidates for disease relevance, but previously without known mechanism, 
such as ADAMTS13 (ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif, 13) for
coronary artery disease. In still other cases, the missense SNPs are in proteins 
not previously suggested as disease candidates, such as TUBB1 (tubulin, beta 1,
class VI) for hypertension. Together, these data support a substantial role for
this class of SNPs in susceptibility to common human disease.

Genome-wide association studies in Crohn's disease (CD) have identified 140
genome-wide significant loci. However, identification of genes driving
association signals remains challenging. Furthermore, genome-wide significant
thresholds limit false positives at the expense of decreased sensitivity. In this
study, we explored gene features contributing to CD pathogenicity, including
gene-based association data from CD and autoimmune (AI) diseases, as well as gene
expression features (eQTLs, epigenetic markers of expression and intestinal gene 
expression data). We developed an integrative model based on a CD reference gene 
set. This integrative approach outperformed gene-based association signals alone 
in identifying CD-related genes based on statistical validation, gene ontology
enrichment, differential expression between M1 and M2 macrophages and a
validation using genes causing monogenic forms of inflammatory bowel disease as a
reference. Besides gene-level CD association P-values, association with AI
diseases was the strongest predictor, highlighting generalized mechanisms of
inflammation, and the interferon-γ pathway particularly. Within the 140
high-confidence CD regions, 598 of 1328 genes had low prioritization scores,
highlighting genes unlikely to contribute to CD pathogenesis. For select regions,
comparably high integrative model scores were observed for multiple genes. This
is particularly evident for regions having extensive linkage disequilibrium such 
as the IBD5 locus. Our analyses provide a standardized reference for prioritizing
potential CD-related genes, in regions with both highly significant and nominally
significant gene-level association P-values. Our integrative model may be
particularly valuable in prioritizing rare, potentially private, missense
variants for which genome-wide evidence for association may be unattainable.

Overwhelming evidences supports the idea that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is
caused by a complex interplay between genetic alterations of multiple genes and
an aberrant interaction with environmental factors. There is growing evidence
that epigenetic factors can play a significant part in the pathogenesis of IBD.
Significant effort has been invested in uncovering genetic and epigenetic
factors, which may increase the risk of IBD, but progress has been slow, and few 
IBD-specific factors have been detected so far. It has been known for decades
that DNA methylation is the most well studied epigenetic modification, and
analysis of DNA methylation is leading to a new generation of cancer biomarkers. 
Therefore, in this review, we summarize the role of DNA methylation alteration in
IBD pathogenesis, and discuss specific genes or genetic loci using recent
molecular technology advances. Here, we suggest that DNA methylation should be
studied in depth to understand the molecular pathways of IBD pathogenesis, and
discuss epigenetic studies of IBD that may have a significant impact on the field
of IBD research.

OBJECTIVE: Takayasu arteritis (TAK) is a systemic vasculitis affecting large
arteries and large branches of the aorta. Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a prevalent 
autoimmune colitis. Since TAK and UC share HLA-B*52:01 and IL12B as genetic
determinants, and since there are case reports of the co-occurrence of these
diseases, we hypothesized that UC is a common complication of TAK. We undertook
this study to perform a large-scale analysis of TAK, both to evaluate the
prevalence of concurrent cases of TAK and UC and to identify and estimate
susceptibility genes shared between the 2 diseases.
METHODS: We analyzed a total of 470 consecutive patients with TAK from 14
institutions. We characterized patients with TAK and UC by analyzing clinical
manifestations and genetic components. Genetic overlapping of TAK and UC was
evaluated with the use of UC susceptibility single-nucleotide polymorphisms by
comparing risk directions and effect sizes between susceptibility to the 2
diseases.
RESULTS: Thirty of 470 patients with TAK had UC (6.4% [95% confidence interval
4.3-9.0]). This percentage was strikingly higher than that expected from the
prevalence of UC in Japan. Patients with TAK complicated with UC developed TAK at
an earlier stage of life (P = 0.0070) and showed significant enrichment of
HLA-B*52:01 compared to TAK patients without UC (P = 1.0 × 10(-5) ) (odds ratio
12.14 [95% confidence interval 2.96-107.23]). The 110 non-HLA markers of
susceptibility to UC significantly displayed common risk directions with
susceptibility to TAK (P = 0.0054) and showed significant departure of
permutation P values from expected P values (P < 1.0 × 10(-10) ).
CONCLUSION: UC is a major complication of TAK. These 2 diseases share a
significant proportion of their genetic background, and HLA-B*52:01 may play a
central role in their co-occurrence.

INTRODUCTION: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)
can profoundly affect quality of life and are influenced by stress and
resiliency. The impact of mind-body interventions (MBIs) on IBS and IBD patients 
has not previously been examined.
METHODS: Nineteen IBS and 29 IBD patients were enrolled in a 9-week relaxation
response based mind-body group intervention (RR-MBI), focusing on elicitation of 
the RR and cognitive skill building. Symptom questionnaires and inflammatory
markers were assessed pre- and post-intervention, and at short-term follow-up.
Peripheral blood transcriptome analysis was performed to identify genomic
correlates of the RR-MBI.
RESULTS: Pain Catastrophizing Scale scores improved significantly
post-intervention for IBD and at short-term follow-up for IBS and IBD. Trait
Anxiety scores, IBS Quality of Life, IBS Symptom Severity Index, and IBD
Questionnaire scores improved significantly post-intervention and at short-term
follow-up for IBS and IBD, respectively. RR-MBI altered expression of more genes 
in IBD (1059 genes) than in IBS (119 genes). In IBD, reduced expression of RR-MBI
response genes was most significantly linked to inflammatory response, cell
growth, proliferation, and oxidative stress-related pathways. In IBS, cell cycle 
regulation and DNA damage related gene sets were significantly upregulated after 
RR-MBI. Interactive network analysis of RR-affected pathways identified TNF, AKT 
and NF-κB as top focus molecules in IBS, while in IBD kinases (e.g. MAPK, P38
MAPK), inflammation (e.g. VEGF-C, NF-κB) and cell cycle and proliferation (e.g.
UBC, APP) related genes emerged as top focus molecules.
CONCLUSIONS: In this uncontrolled pilot study, participation in an RR-MBI was
associated with improvements in disease-specific measures, trait anxiety, and
pain catastrophizing in IBS and IBD patients. Moreover, observed gene expression 
changes suggest that NF-κB is a target focus molecule in both IBS and IBD-and
that its regulation may contribute to counteracting the harmful effects of stress
in both diseases. Larger, controlled studies are needed to confirm this
preliminary finding.

Actions of Adjunctive Nutritional Antioxidants in Periodontitis and Prevalent
Systemic Inflammatory Diseases.

Common risk markers for periodontitis and prevalent systemic comorbidities
indicate similarities in their progression and molecular mechanisms involved.
Resultant pro-oxidant disease profiles provide scope for attenuating their
pathogeneses with appropriate adjunctive antioxidants. Levels of oxidative stress
markers 8-hydroxy-deoxguanosine (8-HOdG) and malondialdehyde (MDA) are
significantly higher in periodontitis and other chronic inflammatory conditions. 
There is a clear link between periodontitis and diseases associated with
significant systemic inflammatory loading, such as metabolic syndrome. Micro- and
macro-nutrients have proven to be effective in curbing molecular mechanisms that 
generate reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. A Mediterranean diet rich in
fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grain, nuts, fish, olive oil and red wine in
moderation, could be attributed to the lower occurrence of cardiovascular
disease, insulin resistance and other inflammatory diseases in this region. A
significant number of naturally occurring flavonoids have been identified in
these products. Flavonoids comprising flavonols, flavones and isoflavones are
potent free radical scavengers, effective in inhibiting lipid peroxidation, with 
anti-atherosclerotic and antihypertensive effects.The phenolic compound
oleocanthal isolated in virgin olive oil has similar anti-inflammatory actions to
that of ibuprofen. The anti-atherogenic effects of MUFA and PUFA in nuts, enhance
endothelial function by reducing total cholesterol, oxidized LDL, hs-CRP, sVCAM-1
levels, lipids, lipoproteins and inflammatory markers. Epigenetics influenced by 
environmental factors and interactions between genes and nutrients, are important
considerations in influencing these effects. Using antioxidants as therapeutic
adjuncts could enhance the antioxidant capacity of an inherent glutathione system
and overcome oxidative effects, thereby mitigating therapeutic side-effects.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Recent evidence suggests that survivin, a member of the
inhibitors of apoptosis family that prevents cell death and regulates cell
division is implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
The aim of the study was to identify a possible association between individual
genetic variation, IBD susceptibility, and response to infliximab (IFX).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The expression levels of survivin were detected in
pathologic areas of fresh tissues and blood samples by real-time reverse
transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from IBD patients.
Polymorphisms were identified using the polymerase chain reaction - Restriction
Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique. Clinical and endoscopic
response to IFX was evaluated by ileocolonoscopy performed at baseline and after 
12-20 weeks of therapy with patients classified as either responders or
nonresponders.
RESULTS: No significant differences were found between survivin mRNA levels
between patients and controls. Significant differences in both allele and
genotype frequencies between Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)
patients and controls were found in -31C/G polymorphism. No association with IBD 
development was found for the -625G/C and -241T/C polymorphisms, since those
polymorphisms were overrepresented in a healthy population. Additionally no
significant association was found between -31C/G polymorphism and the clinical
response of CD patients to IFX.
CONCLUSIONS: Survivin promoter polymorphism -31C/G might influence the
susceptibility to IBD in the Greek population, but not the CD patient's response 
to anti-TNF drugs.

PURPOSE: Epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes is involved in early
transforming events and has a high impact on colorectal carcinogenesis. Likewise,
colon cancers that derive from chronically inflamed bowel diseases frequently
exhibit epigenetic changes. But there is little data about epigenetic aberrations
causing colorectal cancer in chronically inflamed tissue. The aim of the present 
study was to evaluate the aberrant gain of methylation in the gene promoters of
VIM, TFPI2 and ITGA4 as putative early markers in the development from inflamed
tissue via precancerous lesions toward colorectal cancer.
METHODS: Initial screening of different cancer cell lines by using
methylation-specific PCR revealed a putative colon cancer-specific methylation
pattern. Additionally, a demethylation assay was performed to investigate the
methylation-dependent gene silencing of ITGA4. The candidate markers were
analyzed in colonic tissue specimens from patients with colorectal cancer (n =
15), adenomas (n = 76), serrated lesions (n = 13), chronic inflammation (n = 10) 
and normal mucosal samples (n = 9).
RESULTS: A high methylation frequency of VIM (55.6 %) was observed in normal
colon tissue, whereas ITGA4 and TFPI2 were completely unmethylated in controls. A
significant gain of methylation frequency with progression of disease as well as 
an age-dependent effect was detectable for TFPI2. ITGA4 methylation frequency was
high in precancerous and cancerous tissues as well as in inflammatory bowel
diseases (IBD).
CONCLUSION: The already established methylation marker VIM does not permit a
specific and sensitive discrimination of healthy and neoplastic tissue. The
methylation markers ITGA4 and TFPI2 seem to be suitable risk markers for
inflammation-associated colon cancer.

BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) share some
pathogenetic features. To provide new steps on the role of altered gene
expression, and the involvement of gene networks, in the pathogenesis of these
diseases, we performed a genome-wide analysis in 15 patients with CD and 14
patients with UC by comparing the RNA from inflamed and noninflamed colonic
mucosa.
METHODS: Two hundred ninety-eight differentially expressed genes in CD and 520
genes in UC were identified. By bioinformatic analyses, 34 pathways for CD, 6 of 
them enriched in noninflamed and 28 in inflamed tissues, and 19 pathways for UC, 
17 in noninflamed and 2 in inflamed tissues, were also highlighted.
RESULTS: In CD, the pathways included genes associated with cytokines and
cytokine receptors connection, response to external stimuli, activation of cell
proliferation or differentiation, cell migration, apoptosis, and immune
regulation. In UC, the pathways were associated with genes related to metabolic
and catabolic processes, biosynthesis and interconversion processes, leukocyte
migration, regulation of cell proliferation, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition.
CONCLUSIONS: In UC, the pattern of inflammation of colonic mucosa is due to a
complex interaction network between host, gut microbiome, and diet, suggesting
that bacterial products or endogenous synthetic/catabolic molecules contribute to
impairment of the immune response, to breakdown of epithelial barrier, and to
enhance the inflammatory process. In patients with CD, genes encoding a large
variety of proteins, growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion
molecules may lead to uncontrolled inflammation with ensuing destruction of
epithelial cells, inappropriate stimulation of antimicrobial and T cells
differentiation, and inflammasome events.

Autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) for adoptive cell
therapy of luminal Crohn's disease (CD) are being tested in clinical trials.
However, CD is associated with dysregulation of autophagy and its effect on MSC's
immunobiology is unknown. Here, we demonstrate no quantitative difference in
phenotype, in vitro growth kinetics and molecular signatures to IFNγ between MSCs
derived from CD and healthy individuals. CD MSCs were indistinguishable from
those derived from healthy controls at inhibiting T-cell proliferation through an
indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)-dependent mechanism. Upon IFNγ prelicensing,
both MSC populations inhibit T-cell effector functions. Neither a
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7820268 in the IDO gene, nor a widely
reported CD predisposing SNP ATG16L1rs2241880 modulated the suppressive function 
of MSCs carrying these haplotypes. IFNγ stimulation or coculture with activated T
cells upregulated the expression of autophagy genes and/or vacuoles on MSCs.
Pharmacological blockade of autophagy pathway did not reverse the
immunosuppressive properties and IFNγ responsiveness of MSCs confirming the
absence of a functional link between these two cell biochemical properties. We
conclude that autophagy, but not IDO and IFNγ responsiveness, is dispensable for 
MSC's immunosuppressive properties. MSCs from CD subjects are functionally
analogous to those of healthy individuals.

BACKGROUND: Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease (PIBD) is a chronic condition
seen in genetically predisposed individuals. Genome-wide association studies have
implicated >160 genomic loci in IBD with many genes coding for proteins in key
immune pathways. This study looks at autoimmune disease burden in patients
diagnosed with PIBD and interrogates exome data of a subset of patients.
METHODS: Patients were recruited from the Southampton Genetics of PIBD cohort.
Clinical diagnosis of autoimmune disease in these individuals was ascertained
from medical records. For a subset of patients with PIBD and concurrent asthma,
exome data was interrogated to ascertain the burden of pathogenic variants within
genes implicated in asthma. Association testing was conducted between cases and
population controls using the SKAT-O test.
RESULTS: Forty-nine (28.3%) PIBD children (18.49% CD, 8.6% UC, and 21.15% IBDU
patients) had a concurrent clinical diagnosis of at least one other autoimmune
disorder; asthma was the most prevalent, affecting 16.2% of the PIBD cohort. Rare
and common variant association testing revealed 6 significant genes (P < 0.05)
before Bonferroni adjustment. Three of these genes were previously implicated in 
both asthma and IBD (ZPBP2 IL1R1, and IL18R1) and 3 in asthma only (PYHIN1,
IL2RB, and GSTP1).
CONCLUSIONS: One-third of our cohort had a concurrent autoimmune condition. We
observed higher incidence of asthma compared with the overall pediatric
prevalence. Despite a small sample size, SKAT-O evaluated a significant burden of
rare and common mutations in 6 genes. Variant burden suggests that a systemic
immune dysregulation rather than organ-specific could underpin immune dysfunction
for a subset of patients.

The pathogenesis of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is only partially 
understood. Strong evidence implicates a strong genetic component including high 
monozygotic twin concordance and familial disease phenotype concordance rates.
Genome-wide association studies have identified associations between >160 genetic
loci and the risk for developing IBD. The roles of implicated genes are largely
immune-mediated, although other functions include cellular migration, oxidative
stress, and carbohydrate metabolism. Additionally, growing literature describes
monogenic causes of IBD that frequently present as infantile or very early-onset 
IBD. The interplay between IBD risk single nucleotide polymorphisms and rare
genetic variants has yet to be determined. Studying patients with very
early-onset IBD may elicit genetic factors that could be applied to broader
populations of IBD. This review describes what is known about the genetic causes 
of very early-onset IBD and genetic strategies that may unravel more of the
genetic causes of IBD.

BACKGROUND: Identifying specific genes that are differentially expressed during
inflammatory bowel disease flares may help stratify disease activity. The aim of 
this study was to identify panels of genes to be able to distinguish disease
activity in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).
METHODS: Patients were grouped into categories based on disease and severity
determined by histological grading. Whole blood was collected by PAXgene Blood
RNA collection tubes, (PreAnalytiX) and gene expression analysis using messenger 
RNA was conducted. Logistic regression was performed on multiple combinations of 
common probe sets, and data were evaluated in terms of discrimination by
computing the area under the receiving operator characteristic curve (ROC-AUC).
RESULTS: Nine inactive CD, 8 mild CD, 10 moderate-to-severe CD, 9 inactive UC, 8 
mild UC, 10 moderate-to-severe UC, and 120 controls were hybridized to Affymetrix
U133 Plus 2 microarrays. Panels of 6 individual genes discriminated the stages of
disease activity: CD with mild severity {ROC-AUC, 0.89 (95% confidence interval
[CI], 0.84%-0.95%)}, CD with moderate-to-severe severity (ROC-AUC 0.98 [95% CI,
0.97-1.0]), UC with mild severity (ROC-AUC 0.92 [95% CI, 0.87-0.96]), and UC with
moderate-to-severe severity (ROC-AUC 0.99 [95% CI, 0.97-1.0]). Validation by
real-time reverse transcription-PCR confirmed the Affymetrix microarray data.
CONCLUSIONS: The specific whole blood gene panels reliably distinguished CD and
UC and determined the activity of disease, with high sensitivity and specificity 
in our cohorts of patients. This simple serological test has the potential to
become a biomarker to determine the activity of disease.

BACKGROUND: Pouchitis is common after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) surgery
for ulcerative colitis (UC). Similar to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), both
host genetics and the microbiota are implicated in its pathogenesis. We use the
IPAA model of IBD to associate mucosal host gene expression with mucosal
microbiomes and clinical outcomes. We analyze host transcriptomic data and 16S
rRNA gene sequencing data from paired biopsies from IPAA patients with UC and
familial adenomatous polyposis. To achieve power for a genome-wide
microbiome-transcriptome association study, we use principal component analysis
for transcript and clade reduction, and identify significant co-variation between
clades and transcripts.
RESULTS: Host transcripts co-vary primarily with biopsy location and
inflammation, while microbes co-vary primarily with antibiotic use.
Transcript-microbe associations are surprisingly modest, but the most strongly
microbially-associated host transcript pattern is enriched for complement cascade
genes and for the interleukin-12 pathway. Activation of these host processes is
inversely correlated with Sutterella, Akkermansia, Bifidobacteria, and Roseburia 
abundance, and positively correlated with Escherichia abundance.
CONCLUSIONS: This study quantifies the effects of inflammation, antibiotic use,
and biopsy location upon the microbiome and host transcriptome during pouchitis. 
Understanding these effects is essential for basic biological insights as well as
for well-designed and adequately-powered studies. Additionally, our study
provides a method for profiling host-microbe interactions with appropriate
statistical power using high-throughput sequencing, and suggests that
cross-sectional changes in gut epithelial transcription are not a major component
of the host-microbiome regulatory interface during pouchitis.

By aggregating data for complex traits in a biologically meaningful way, gene and
gene-set analysis constitute a valuable addition to single-marker analysis.
However, although various methods for gene and gene-set analysis currently exist,
they generally suffer from a number of issues. Statistical power for most methods
is strongly affected by linkage disequilibrium between markers, multi-marker
associations are often hard to detect, and the reliance on permutation to compute
p-values tends to make the analysis computationally very expensive. To address
these issues we have developed MAGMA, a novel tool for gene and gene-set
analysis. The gene analysis is based on a multiple regression model, to provide
better statistical performance. The gene-set analysis is built as a separate
layer around the gene analysis for additional flexibility. This gene-set analysis
also uses a regression structure to allow generalization to analysis of
continuous properties of genes and simultaneous analysis of multiple gene sets
and other gene properties. Simulations and an analysis of Crohn's Disease data
are used to evaluate the performance of MAGMA and to compare it to a number of
other gene and gene-set analysis tools. The results show that MAGMA has
significantly more power than other tools for both the gene and the gene-set
analysis, identifying more genes and gene sets associated with Crohn's Disease
while maintaining a correct type 1 error rate. Moreover, the MAGMA analysis of
the Crohn's Disease data was found to be considerably faster as well.

Autophagy is a common physiological process in cell homeostasis and regulation.
Autophagy-related gene mutations and autophagy disorders are important in Crohn's
disease (CD). The nucleotide oligomerization domain 2-autophagy genes autophagy
16-like 1 (NOD2-ATG16L1) signaling axis disorder contributes to the dysfunction
of autophagy. This paper is focused on the relationship between contactin
associated protein-like 3 (CNTNAP3) and ATG16L1 expression in Crohn's disease.
The results indicated that the expression of ATG16L1 is higher in some CD
patients compared to normal controls. ATG16L1 was well correlated with the
C-reactive protein (CRP) in some CD patients. In vitro study revealed that
CNTNAP3 could upregulate the expression of ATG16L1 and increase autophagy
vacuoles.

The poultry-associated bacterium Mycoplasma iowae colonizes multiple sites in
embryos, with disease or death resulting. Although M. iowae accumulates in the
intestinal tract, it does not cause disease at that site, but rather only in
tissues that are exposed to atmospheric O2. The activity of M. iowae catalase,
encoded by katE, is capable of rapid removal of damaging H2O2 from solution, and 
katE confers a substantial reduction in the amount of H2O2 produced by Mycoplasma
gallisepticum katE transformants in the presence of glycerol. As
catalase-producing bacteria are often beneficial to hosts with inflammatory bowel
disease, we explored whether M. iowae was exclusively protective against
H2O2-producing bacteria in a Caenorhabditis elegans model, whether its
protectiveness changed in response to O2 levels, and whether expression of genes 
involved in H2O2 metabolism and virulence changed in response to O2 levels. We
observed that M. iowae was in fact protective against H2O2-producing
Streptococcus pneumoniae, but not HCN-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and that 
M. iowae cells grown in 1% O2 promoted survival of C. elegans to a greater extent
than M. iowae cells grown in atmospheric O2. Transcript levels of an M. iowae
gene encoding a homolog of Mycoplasma pneumoniae CARDS toxin were 5-fold lower in
cells grown in low O2. These data suggest that reduced O2, representing the
intestinal environment, triggers M. iowae to reduce its virulence capabilities,
effecting a change from a pathogenic mode to a potentially beneficial one.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is an uncommon noninfectious neutrophilic dermatosis
characterized by recurrent, sterile, necrotic skin ulcers. It is commonly
associated with underlying systemic disease like inflammatory bowel disease,
rheumatoid arthritis and hematological malignancies. Pathogenesis of PG remains
unclear though aberrant immune responses have been implicated. The diagnosis of
PG is of exclusion and management is empirical with local or systemic
immunosuppressive therapy. LAD-I is a rare form of autosomal recessive disorders 
caused by mutations of the gene ITGB2, clinically characterized by recurrent
severe bacterial infection, impaired pus formation, poor wound healing and
persistent neutrophilia. Though skin ulcerations are common, predominant clinical
presentation as PG is unusual in LAD-I. Here we present four Indian patients with
LAD-I from three unrelated families initially diagnosed as PG due to chronic
recurrent skin ulcerations requiring steroids and antibiotics for healing,
associated with atrophic scar formation. All these four patients had persistent
neutrophilia without history of delayed cord separation and showed moderate
expression of CD18 (19 to 68%) on neutrophils. Sequencing of the entire coding
region and intronic splice sites of the ITGB2 gene from the genomic DNA of these 
patients revealed a novel common mutation IVS10+4A>G. LAD-I should be kept in
mind while evaluating patients with PG especially those with persistent
neutrophila in the absence of other rheumatological disorders. Diagnosis of LAD-I
in these cases is extremely important for management as treating these patients
without adequate antibiotic cover may prove fatal and these patients often
require hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for permanent cure.

BACKGROUND: Several studies have reported that polyphenols may exert beneficial
effects on inflammatory bowel disease. This study aimed to evaluate the effects
of preventive consumption of polyphenol-rich red grape pomace extracts (GPEs) on 
dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in rats. Rats were fed for 21 days
with a semi-synthetic diet enriched with a GPE (Alicante-S, Alicante-P or
Pinot-S) and colitis was induced by DSS administration in drinking water
(40 g L(-1) ) during the last 7 days of experimentation.
RESULTS: GPEs attenuated clinical signs and colon shortening and Alicante GPEs
limited histological lesions induced by DSS. GPEs curbed the increase in
myeloperoxidase activity and modulated antioxidant enzyme activities. Moreover,
GPEs prevented the DSS-induced increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and
the up-regulation of various genes implicated in colitis such as intercellular
adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9).
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that polyphenol-rich red GPEs could provide
prevention against colon inflammation.

BACKGROUND: Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection has been reported to be a
cause of refractory ulcerative colitis (UC). Toxic megacolon (TM) is a rare but
severe complication of an acute attack of UC.
OBJECTIVES: Aim of this study is to evaluate in a case-control study the
association between HCMV and TM.
STUDY DESIGN: All patients who were admitted at Medicine Department of V.
Cervello Hospital in Palermo (tertiary referral center) for a severe UC flare-up 
complicated by the onset of TM (diameter of the transverse colon>6 cm) between
January 1990 and November 2011 were identified through the electronic database. A
total of 24 consecutive patients (16 male/8 female) with TM were identified. Each
case of TM were individually matched by sex, age, extent of the underlying
disease to 24 severe UC controls who did not develop TM. A further non matched
control population of 48 severe UC was included. Haematoxilin and eosin stain,
immunohistochemical procedure and nested polymerase chain reaction were performed
to detect HCMV genes and proteins on rectal biopsies or surgical specimens. Pp65 
antigenemia was performed in order to diagnose any possible systemic infection.
HCMV frequency was compared between patients with and without TM during
follow-up, using Fisher's Exact test.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: HCMV was detected in histological specimens of 11
patients (46%) with TM compared to 2 (9%) severe UC matched controls (P = 0.0078)
and 7 (14%) unmatched controls (p = 0,003). In severe colitis the presence of
HCMV is more frequently associated with TM.

Phyllanthus niruri L. belongs to the Euphorbiaceae, and is known by the common
name of 'stonebreaker' in Brazil. Some species within the Phyllanthus genus are
widely used in traditional medicine to counteract different types of
anti-inflammatory diseases.OBJECTIVES: In this study, the preventive intestinal
anti-inflammatory activity of spray-dried extract of P. niruri (SDEPn) was tested
in the model of acetic acid (10%)-induced ulcerative colitis in the rat.
METHODS: Colitis animals were given orally at doses 25, 100 and 200 mg/kg. Colons
tissue was analysed by macroscopic score, by histopathology score, by the
immunohistochemical examination of tumour necrosis factor alpha, p53 and
interferon gamma; by spectroscopic ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry (UV/VIS)
analysis of the levels of myeloperoxidase, malonaldehyde and total glutathione.
KEY FINDINGS/RESULT: Pretreatment of the extract to colitic rats significantly
attenuated colonic macroscopic damage induced by acetic acid (P < 0.01).
Spray-dried extract of P. niruri prevented glutathione depletion (P < 0.001) and 
malondialdehyde levels (P < 0.05) declined. Spray-dried extract of P. niruri
significantly reduced microscopic damage to tissues, such as leukocyte
infiltration accompanied by a significant reduction in myeloperoxidase activity
(P < 0.5). Immunohistochemistry revealed a decline in the TNF-α, IFN-γ and p53
protein (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Spray-dried extract of P. niruri has a beneficial effect in the acute
phase of acetic acid-induced colitis in the rat, which is probably related to its
antioxidant properties.

A systematic review and meta-analyses were undertaken to investigate the
association of SLC11A1 genetic variants with disease occurrence. Literature
searching indentified 109 publications to include in the meta-analyses assessing 
the association of 11 SLC11A1 variants with autoimmune and infectious disease.
The (GT)n promoter alleles 2 and 3 (rs534448891), which alter SLC11A1 expression,
were significantly associated with tuberculosis (OR=1.47 (1.30-1.66), OR=0.76
(0.65-0.89), respectively) and infectious disease (OR=1.25 (1.10-1.42), OR=0.83
(0.74-0.93), respectively). However, although no association was observed with
autoimmune disease, a modest significant association was observed with type 1
diabetes (allele 2 OR=0.94 (0.89-0.98)). On the basis of a stronger association
of (GT)n allele 2 with tuberculosis, compared with the protective effect of
allele 3, we hypothesise that allele 2 is likely the disease-causing variant
influencing disease susceptibility. Significant associations were observed
between the 469+14G/C polymorphism (rs3731865) and autoimmune disease (OR=1.30
(1.04-1.64)) and rheumatoid arthritis (OR=1.60 (1.20-2.13)) and between the
-237C/T polymorphism (rs7573065) and inflammatory bowel disease (OR=0.60
(0.43-0.84)). Further, significant associations were identified between the
469+14G/C, 1730G/A and 1729+55del4 polymorphisms (rs3731865, rs17235409 and
rs17235416, respectively) and both infectious disease per se and tuberculosis.
These findings show a clear association between variants in the SLC11A1 locus and
autoimmune and infectious disease susceptibility.

Despite the success of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in detecting a
large number of loci for complex phenotypes such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
susceptibility, the lack of information on the causal genes leaves important
challenges to interpret GWAS results in the context of the disease biology. Here,
we genetically fine-map the RA risk locus at 19p13 to define causal variants, and
explore the pleiotropic effects of these same variants in other complex traits.
First, we combined Immunochip dense genotyping (n = 23,092 case/control samples),
Exomechip genotyping (n = 18,409 case/control samples) and targeted
exon-sequencing (n = 2,236 case/controls samples) to demonstrate that three
protein-coding variants in TYK2 (tyrosine kinase 2) independently protect against
RA: P1104A (rs34536443, OR = 0.66, P = 2.3 x 10(-21)), A928V (rs35018800, OR =
0.53, P = 1.2 x 10(-9)), and I684S (rs12720356, OR = 0.86, P = 4.6 x 10(-7)).
Second, we show that the same three TYK2 variants protect against systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE, Pomnibus = 6 x 10(-18)), and provide suggestive evidence that
two of the TYK2 variants (P1104A and A928V) may also protect against inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD; P(omnibus) = 0.005). Finally, in a phenome-wide association
study (PheWAS) assessing >500 phenotypes using electronic medical records (EMR)
in >29,000 subjects, we found no convincing evidence for association of P1104A
and A928V with complex phenotypes other than autoimmune diseases such as RA, SLE 
and IBD. Together, our results demonstrate the role of TYK2 in the pathogenesis
of RA, SLE and IBD, and provide supporting evidence for TYK2 as a promising drug 
target for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.

The genetic diversity of loci implicated in glucocorticoid (GC) response has been
associated with interindividual variations in responsiveness to GC in various
diseases, such as asthma and inflammatory bowel disorders. In acute
graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), similar differences of first-line therapy
responsiveness are also observed, with approximately 40% of patients failing to
respond to GC. Here, the distribution of functionally relevant single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNP) belonging to the GC-induced transcript 1 GLCCI1 (rs37972) and
the glucocorticoid receptor (rs41423247, rs6195 and rs6198) gene loci were
analyzed alongside clinical factors for their association with the response to
corticosteroids in aGVHD. The frequencies of variant alleles did not differ
significantly between corticoresistant patients, their donors, and their
corticosensitive peers (P = .10 to 1.00). Severe and early onset of aGVHD, bone
marrow as the stem cell source, and an HLA mismatch were associated with the
failure to respond to GC in logistic regression. After including the single SNPs 
to the model, carriers of the rs41423247 polymorphism had a higher probability of
responding to GC, whereas all other polymorphisms did not affect the likelihood
of response.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an important etiologic factor in the
development of colorectal cancer (CRC). The risk of CRC begins to increase 8 or
10 years after the diagnosis of IBD. This type of cancer is called
colitis-associated CRC (CA-CRC). The molecular pathogenesis of inflammatory
epithelium might play a critical role in the development of CA-CRC. Genetic
alterations detected in CA-CRC such as genetic mutations, microsatellite
instability, and DNA hypermethylation are also recognized in sporadic CRC;
however, there are differences in the timing and frequency of molecular events
between CA-CRC and sporadic CRC. Interaction between gene-environmental factors, 
including inflammation, lifestyle, psychological stress, and prior appendectomy, 
might be associated with the etiopathology of IBD. The mucosal inflammatory
mediators, such as oxidant stress, free radicals, and chemokines, may cause the
genetic alterations. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of CA-CRC might be
important to develop clinical efficacies for patients with IBD. This review
discusses the molecular characteristics of CA-CRC, especially ulcerative
colitis-associated CRC, including clinical features, signaling pathways, and
interactions between genetic alterations and environment involved in inflammatory
carcinogenesis.

AIM: To evaluate variation of the concentration of thiopurine metabolites after
5-aminosalicylate (5-ASA) interruption and the role of genetic polymorphisms of
N-acetyl transferase (NAT) 1 and 2.
METHODS: Concentrations of thioguanine nucleotides (TGN) and methymercaptopurine 
nucleotides (MMPN), metabolites of thiopurines, were measured by high performance
liquid chromatography in 12 young patients (3 females and 9 males, median age 16 
years) with inflammatory bowel disease (6 Crohn's disease and 6 ulcerative
colitis) treated with thiopurines (7 mercaptopurine and 5 azathioprine) and
5-ASA. Blood samples were collected one month before and one month after the
interruption of 5-ASA. DNA was extracted and genotyping of NAT1, NAT2, inosine
triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPA) and thiopurine methyl transferase (TPMT)
genes was performed using PCR assays.
RESULTS: Median TGN concentration before 5-ASA interruption was 270 pmol/8 x
10(8) erythrocytes (range: 145-750); after the interruption of the
aminosalicylate, a 35% reduction in TGN mean concentrations (absolute mean
reduction 109 pmol/8 × 10(8) erythrocytes) was observed (median 221 pmol/8 ×
10(8) erythrocytes, range: 96-427, P value linear mixed effects model 0.0011).
Demographic and clinical covariates were not related to thiopurine metabolites
concentrations. All patients were wild-type for the most relevant ITPA and TPMT
variants. For NAT1 genotyping, 7 subjects presented an allele combination
corresponding to fast enzymatic activity and 5 to slow activity. NAT1 genotypes
corresponding to fast enzymatic activity were associated with reduced TGN
concentration (P value linear mixed effects model 0.033), putatively because of
increased 5-ASA inactivation and consequent reduced inhibition of thiopurine
metabolism. The effect of NAT1 status on TGN seems to be persistent even after
one month since the interruption of the aminosalicylate. No effect of NAT1
genotypes was shown on MMPN concentrations. NAT2 genotyping revealed that 6
patients presented a genotype corresponding to fast enzymatic activity and 6 to
slow activity; NAT2 genotypes were not related to thiopurine metabolites
concentration in this study.
CONCLUSION: NAT1 genotype affects TGN levels in patients treated with thiopurines
and aminosalicylates and could therefore influence the toxicity and efficacy of
these drugs; however the number of patients evaluated is limited and this has to 
be considered a pilot study.

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are a group of chronic gastrointestinal
disorders with alternating relapses and remissions. Two main types within IBD can
be distinguished: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Considering the
epidemiological, immunological and genetic data, it was concluded that IBD
possess multifactorial etiology, where genetic and environmental factors form the
immunological background for the disease. In this review we discuss the most
important genes and their protein products in IBD etiology and their impact on
IBD pharmacotherapy.

Crohn's disease (CD) is a major subtype of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
Herb-partitioned moxibustion (HPM) has been proven to be effective in treating CD
by a large amount of clinical and experimental researches. MiRNAs (microRNAs) are
increasingly recognized as important posttranscriptional regulators of
inflammatory genes. In this study, we established experimental CD rat models and 
investigated the miRNAs associated with the onset of experimental CD; then, we
further identified CD-related miRNAs that were regulated by HPM and explored the 
relationship between CD and the potential target genes of involved miRNAs. We
found that miR-147 and miR-205 were significantly downregulated in colons of
experimental CD rats and may be closely associated with the onset of experimental
CD. HPM may extenuate inflammatory responses in colons and ameliorate colonic
damages in CD via upregulating the expression of miR-147 and miR-205 and then
further downregulating the expression of inflammation-related mRNAs, negatively
regulating inflammatory signal pathways, and reducing the production of
downstream inflammatory cytokines.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Escherichia coli can be isolated from lamina propria
macrophages in Crohn's disease (CD), and their intramacrophage persistence may
provide a stimulus for inflammation. To further determine the contributions of
macrophage dysfunction and E. coli pathogenicity to this, we aimed to compare in 
vitro functioning of macrophages from patients with CD and healthy controls (HC) 
in response to infection with CD-derived adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC) and
less pathogenic E. coli strains.
METHODS: Monocyte-derived macrophages were cultured from patients with CD and HC.
Intramacrophage survival of E. coli strains (CD-derived adherent-invasive [AI]
and non-AI strains and laboratory strain K-12) was compared. Macrophage cytokine 
release (tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNFα], interleukin [IL]-23, IL-8 and IL-10)
and monocyte phagoctyosis and respiratory burst function were measured after E.
coli infection. For CD patients, laboratory data were correlated with clinical
phenotype, use of immunomodulation, and CD risk alleles (NOD2, IL-23R, ATG16L1
and IRGM).
RESULTS: Attenuated TNFα and IL-23 release from CD macrophages was found after
infection with all E. coli strains. There was prolonged survival of CD-derived
AIEC, CD-derived non-AIEC and E. coli K-12 in macrophages from CD patients
compared to within those from HC. No abnormality of monocyte phagocytosis or
respiratory burst function was detected in CD. Macrophage dysfunction in CD was
not influenced by phenotype, use of immunomodulation or genotype.
CONCLUSIONS: CD macrophage responses to infection with E. coli are deficient,
regardless of clinical phenotype, CD genotype or E. coli pathogenicity. This
suggests host immunodeficiency is an important contributor to intramacrophage E. 
coli persistence in CD.

BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases are incurable illnesses of the
gastrointestinal tract, which substantially enhance the risk of developing
colorectal carcinogenesis. Conventional photodynamic therapy is a clinically
approved therapeutic modality used in the treatment of neoplastic diseases.
Recent preclinical and clinical studies have shown that photodynamic therapy with
low doses of photosensitizer and/or light improves inflammatory conditions,
including colitis. This study aims therefore at investigating the therapeutic
potential of low-dose photodynamic therapy (LDPDT) with a liposomal formulation
of meta-tetra(hydroxyphenyl)chlorin (namely Foslip) in the prevention of
colitis-associated cancer in mice.
METHODS: LDPDT efficacy was evaluated by endoscopic, macroscopic, and
histological analysis. Myeloperoxidase levels were quantified by enzyme linked
immunosorbent assay and cytokines expression by quantitative RT-PCR analysis. The
integrity of the intestinal barrier was evaluated by immunostaining, and
bacterial composition of the fecal microbiota was determined by 454
pyrosequencing of V3-V4 region of bacterial 16S rRNA genes.
RESULTS: LDPDT reduced intestinal tumor growth by decreasing the expression of a 
wide range of inflammatory mediators and by lowering neutrophil influx. LDPDT
treatment prevents onset of a dysbiotic microbiota in the colitis-associated
cancer model.
CONCLUSIONS: LDPDT with Foslip could be considered as a novel treatment modality 
to prevent colorectal carcinogenesis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

AIM: To compare the number of regulatory T-cells (Tregs) measured by flow
cytometry with those obtained using a real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) method in
patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
METHODS: Tregs percentages obtained by both flow cytometry and qPCR methods in 35
adult IBD patients, 18 out of them with Crohn´s disease (CD) and 17 with
ulcerative colitis (UC) were compared to each other as well as to scores on two
IBD activity questionnaires using the Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI) for CD patients
and the Simple Colitis Clinical Activity Index (SCCAI) for UC patients. The Treg 
percentages by flow cytometry were defined as CD4(+)CD25(high)CD127(low)FOXP3(+) 
cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, whereas the Treg percentages by qPCR
method were determined as FOXP3 promoter demethylation in genomic DNA.
RESULTS: We found an average of 1.56% ± 0.78% Tregs by using flow cytometry,
compared to 1.07% ± 0.53% Tregs by using qPCR in adult IBD patients. There were
no significant correlations between either the percentages of Tregs measured by
flow cytometry or qPCR and the HBI or SCCAI questionnaire scores in CD or UC
patients, respectively. In addition, there was no correlation between Treg
percentages measured by qPCR and those measured by flow cytometry (r = -0.06, P =
0.73; Spearman Rho). These data suggest that, either Treg-related immune function
or the clinical scores in these IBD patients did not accurately reflect actual
disease activity. Until the cause(s) for these differences are more clearly
defined, the results suggest caution in interpreting studies of Tregs in various 
inflammatory disorders.
CONCLUSION: The two methods did not produce equivalent measures of the percentage
of total Tregs in the IBD patients studied which is consistent with the
conclusion that Tregs subtypes are not equally detected by these two assays.

The aim of this study was to investigate DNA extraction methods and PCR assays
suitable for the detection of Mycobacterium paratuberculosis in bovine tissue.
The majority of methods currently used to detect M. paratuberculosis have been
developed using bovine samples, such as faeces, blood or tissue and, in many
cases, have been based on detection from pooled samples from a herd. However most
studies have not compared PCR results to culture results. In order to address
this problem, four DNA extraction protocols and three PCR assays were employed to
detect M. paratuberculosis in bovine tissue. Given that culture is reliable from 
cows, the results were then compared with the known M. paratuberculosis culture
status. The following DNA extractions were included, two commercial kits, a
boiling method, an in house extraction based on a published method and enrichment
by sonication. The three PCR assays used included single round IS900 and f57
assays and a nested IS900 assay. In addition, another PCR assay was validated for
the detection of any Mycobacterial species and a universal bacterial 16S rRNA
gene assay was used to detect sample inhibition. The in-house DNA extraction was 
the most consistent in extracting good quality DNA compared to all other methods.
The use of two PCR markers, IS900 and f57, and a universal PCR enabled the
correct samples to be identified as M. paratuberculosis positive. In addition,
when compared to the culture result, false-positives did not occur and PCR
inhibition was readily identified. Using an in house DNA extraction coupled with 
the IS900 and f57 PCR markers, this study provides a reliable and simple method
to detect M. paratuberculosis in both veterinary and spill over infections.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Proper interpretation of data from preclinical animal
studies requires thorough knowledge of the pathophysiology of both the human
disease and animal models. In this study, the expression of inflammatory bowel
disease [IBD]-associated genes was characterised in mouse models of colitis to
examine the underlying molecular pathways and assess the similarity between the
experimental models and human disease.
METHODS: RNA sequencing was performed on colon biopsies from Crohn's disease [CD]
patients, ulcerative colitis [UC] patients and non-IBD controls. Genes shown to
be significantly dysregulated in human IBD were used to study gene expression in 
colons from a piroxicam-accelerated colitis interleukin-10 knockout [PAC IL-10
k.o.], an adoptive transfer [AdTr] and a dextran sulfate sodium [DSS] colitis
mouse model.
RESULTS: Of 115 literature-defined genes linked to IBD, 92 were significantly
differentially expressed in inflamed mucosa of CD and/or UC patients compared
with non-IBD controls. The most upregulated genes were shared by both diseases,
including REG1A, LCN2, NOS2, CXCL1-2, and S100A9. Of those 92 IBD-associated
genes, 71 [77%] were significantly dysregulated in PAC IL-10 k.o. mice, whereas
59 [64%] were significantly dysregulated in AdTr mice compared with wild-type
controls. Some of the most upregulated genes, including S100a8-9, Nos2, and Lcn2,
were shared by the colitis models and correlated with disease activity.
CONCLUSIONS: IBD and experimental murine colitis have a high degree of similarity
in the colonic transcriptional profile, probably secondary to non-specific
inflammatory processes. However, differences do exist between models, emphasising
the need for careful selection and interpretation of qualified animal models in
preclinical research.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: In health, TLR signaling protects the intestinal epithelial
barrier and in disease, aberrant TLR signaling stimulates diverse inflammatory
responses. Association of TLR polymorphisms is ethnicity dependent but how they
impact the complex pathogenesis of IBD is not clearly defined. So we propose to
study the status of polymorphisms in TLR family of genes and their effect on
cytokines level in UC patients.
METHODS: The genotypes of the six loci TLR1-R80T, TLR2-R753Q, TLR3-S258G,
TLR5-R392X, TLR5-N592S and TLR6-S249P were determined in 350 controls and 328 UC 
patients by PCR-RFLP and sequencing. Cytokine levels were measured by ELISA in
blood plasma samples. Data were analyzed statistically by SPSS software.
RESULTS: TLR5 variants R392X and N592S showed significant association (p = 0.007,
0.021) with UC patients but TLR 1, 2, 3, 6 variants did not show any association.
Unlike other studies carried out in different ethnic groups, TLR 6 (S249P) SNP
was universally present in our population irrespective of disease.
Genotype-phenotype correlation analysis revealed that the patients having
combination of multiple SNPs both in TLR5 and TLR4 gene suffered from severe
disease condition and diagnosed at an early age. The level of TNFα (p = 0.004),
IL-6 (p = 0.0001) and IFNγ (p = 0.006) significantly increased in patients as
compared to controls having wild genotypes for the studied SNPs. However, there
was decreased level of TNFα (p = 0.014), IL-6 (p = 0.028) and IFNγ (p = 0.001) in
patients carrying TLR5-R392X variant as compared to wild type patients. Patients 
carrying two simultaneous SNPs D299G in TLR4 gene and N592S in TLR5 gene showed
significant decrease in the levels of TNFα (p = 0.011) and IFNγ (p = 0.016).
CONCLUSION: Polymorphisms in TLR 5 genes were significantly associated with the
UC in North Indian population. The cytokine level was significantly modulated in 
patients with different genotypes of TLR4 and TLR5 SNPs.

The complexity of a common inflammatory disease is influenced by multiple genetic
and environmental factors contributing to the susceptibility of disease. Studies 
have reported that these exogenous and endogenous components may perturb the
balance of innate immune response by activating the NLRP3 inflammasome. The
multimeric NLRP3 complex results in the caspase-1 activation and the release of
potent inflammatory cytokines, like IL-1β. Several studies have been performed on
the association of the genetic alterations in genes encoding NLRP3 and CARD8 with
the complex diseases with inflammatory background, like inflammatory bowel
disease, cardiovascular diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, and type 1 diabetes. The 
aim of the present review is therefore to summarize the literature regarding
genetic alterations in these genes and their association with health and disease.

BACKGROUND: Recent genome-wide association studies have identified nearly 100
susceptibility genes for ulcerative colitis (UC). However, the contribution of
susceptibility variants for UC to clinical outcome has scarcely been reported.
The aim of this study was to investigate whether UC-associated genetic variants
confer a risk of clinical relapse.
METHODS: One hundred and nine consecutive Japanese subjects with quiescent UC
were recruited. Four genetic variants of HLA-DRB1*1502, rs6671847 at FCGR2A,
rs17085007 at 13q12, and rs2108225 at SLC26A3 were genotyped by Invader assay.
The clinical courses were followed after blood sampling, and the risk of relapse 
according to these genotypes was calculated by Cox proportional hazard model.
RESULTS: During the mean follow-up period of 35 months (range 1-81 months), 49 of
109 subjects (45 %) relapsed. Carriers of the G allele of rs6671847 showed an
increased risk of relapse compared with non-carriers [adjusted hazard ratio (HR),
2.27; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1.20-4.32; p = 0.01]. Patients with the CT
or TT genotypes of rs17085007 also had an increased risk of relapse compared to
subjects with the CC genotype (for CT: adjusted HR, 2.16; 95 % CI, 1.10-4.23; p =
0.03; for TT: adjusted HR, 3.25; 95 % CI, 1.18-8.95; p = 0.02). These two risk
variants multiplied the risk of relapse by 2.74 times (95 % CI, 1.10-4.23; p =
0.01) in patients with one risk genotype and 5.40 times (95 % CI, 2.06-14.13; p =
0.0006) in patients with both risk genotypes.
CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variants of rs6671847 at FCGR2A and rs17085007 at 13q12
conferred a risk of relapse in patients with UC.

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for many complex diseases, including
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), produced hundreds of disease-associated
loci-the majority of which are noncoding. The number of GWAS loci is increasing
very rapidly, but the process of translating single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) from these loci to genomic medicine is lagging. In this study, we
investigated 4,734 variants from 152 IBD associated GWAS loci (IBD associated 152
lead noncoding SNPs identified from pooled GWAS results + 4,582 variants in
strong linkage-disequilibrium (LD) (r2 ≥0.8) for EUR population of 1K Genomes
Project) using four publicly available bioinformatics tools, e.g. dbPSHP, CADD,
GWAVA, and RegulomeDB, to annotate and prioritize putative regulatory variants.
Of the 152 lead noncoding SNPs, around 11% are under strong negative selection
(GERP++ RS ≥2); and ~30% are under balancing selection (Tajima's D score >2) in
CEU population (1K Genomes Project)--though these regions are positively selected
(GERP++ RS <0) in mammalian evolution. The analysis of 4,734 variants using three
integrative annotation tools produced 929 putative functional SNPs, of which 18
SNPs (from 15 GWAS loci) are in concordance with all three classifiers. These
prioritized noncoding SNPs may contribute to IBD pathogenesis by dysregulating
the expression of nearby genes. This study showed the usefulness of integrative
annotation for prioritizing fewer functional variants from a large number of GWAS
markers.

BACKGROUND: Canine chronic enteropathies (CE) are believed to be caused by an
aberrant immune response towards the intestinal microbiome. Administration of
probiotics can alleviate colitis in people. In vitro effects of the probiotic
Enterococcus faecium NCIMB 10415 E1707 (EF) previously have been evaluated using 
canine cells (e.g., whole blood, intestinal biopsies), but data on in vivo
efficacy are lacking.
HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: Administration of EF to dogs with food-responsive CE will 
improve clinical outcome and decrease the intestinal inflammatory profile.
ANIMALS: Dogs diagnosed with CE were prospectively recruited to receive a
hydrolyzed elimination diet plus either a synbiotic product containing EF or
placebo for 6 weeks. Both veterinary staff and owners were blinded to the
treatment.
METHODS: Clinical severity index (CCECAI), clinicopathological data and gene
expression using intestinal biopsies (TLR2/4/5/9, IL-17A, IL-22, IL-23p19, RORC, 
IL-2, IL-12p35, TNFα, IL-4, IFNy, IL-10, TGFβ, IL-1β, IL-18, NLRP3, casp-1, TFF1,
TFF3 and PPARy) before and after 6 weeks of treatment were analyzed using linear 
mixed modeling.
RESULTS: Of the 45 cases recruited, 12 finished the clinical trial. Seven
received the synbiotic and 5 the placebo product. There was no difference between
groups or treatments regarding clinical efficacy, histology scores or expression 
of any of the investigated genes.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Standard dietary treatment induced rapid
clinical response in all cases. Because the study was underpowered, it was not
possible to determine whether or not EF had an additional effect within the time 
period of 6 weeks.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a disease strongly associated with colorectal
cancer (CRC) as a well-known precancerous condition. Alterations in DNA
methylation and mutation in K-ras are believed to play an early etiopathogenic
role in CRC and may also an initiating event through deregulation of molecular
signaling. Epigenetic silencing of APC and SFRP2 in the WNT signaling pathway may
also be involved in IBD-CRC. The role of aberrant DNA methylation in precancerous
state of colorectal cancer (CRC) is under intensive investigation worldwide. The 
aim of this study was to investigate the status of promoter methylation of
MGMT-B, APC1A and SFRP2 genes, in inflamed and normal colon tissues of patients
with IBD compared with control normal tissues. A total of 52 IBD tissues as well 
as corresponding normal tissues and 30 samples from healthy participants were
obtained. We determined promoter methylation status of MGMT-B, SFRP2 and APC1A
genes by chemical treatment with sodium bisulfite and subsequent MSP. The most
frequently methylated locus was MGMT-B (71%; 34 of 48), followed by SFRP2 (66.6
%; 32 of 48), and APC1A (43.7%; 21 of 48). Our study demonstrated for the first
time that hypermethylation of the MGMT-B and the SFRP2 gene promoter regions
might be involved in IBD development. Methylation of MGMT-B and SFRP2 in IBD
patients may provide a method for early detection of IBD-associated neoplasia.

BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with diseases of the colon including
inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the
functional role of many of these SNPs is largely unknown and tissue-specific
resources are lacking. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping
identifies target genes of disease-associated SNPs. This study provides a
comprehensive eQTL map of distal colonic samples obtained from 40 healthy African
Americans and demonstrates their relevance for GWAS of colonic diseases.
RESULTS: 8.4 million imputed SNPs were tested for their associations with 16,252 
expression probes representing 12,363 unique genes. 1,941 significant cis-eQTL,
corresponding to 122 independent signals, were identified at a false discovery
rate (FDR) of 0.01. Overall, among colon cis-eQTL, there was significant
enrichment for GWAS variants for IBD (Crohn's disease [CD] and ulcerative colitis
[UC]) and CRC as well as type 2 diabetes and body mass index. ERAP2, ADCY3,
INPP5E, UBA7, SFMBT1, NXPE1 and REXO2 were identified as target genes for
IBD-associated variants. The CRC-associated eQTL rs3802842 was associated with
the expression of C11orf93 (COLCA2). Enrichment of colon eQTL near transcription 
start sites and for active histone marks was demonstrated, and eQTL with high
population differentiation were identified.
CONCLUSIONS: Through the comprehensive study of eQTL in the human colon, this
study identified novel target genes for IBD- and CRC-associated genetic variants.
Moreover, bioinformatic characterization of colon eQTL provides a tissue-specific
tool to improve understanding of biological differences in diseases between
different ethnic groups.

Preferential conversion of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine into methylated
metabolites is a major cause of thiopurine resistance. To seek potentially
Mendelian causes of thiopurine hypermethylation, we recruited 12 individuals who 
exhibited extreme therapeutic resistance while taking azathioprine or
6-mercaptopurine and performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) and copy-number
variant analysis by array-based comparative genomic hybridisation (aCGH).
Exome-wide variant filtering highlighted four genes potentially associated with
thiopurine metabolism (ENOSF1 and NFS1), transport (SLC17A4) or therapeutic
action (RCC2). However, variants of each gene were found only in two or three
patients, and it is unclear whether these genes could influence thiopurine
hypermethylation. Analysis by aCGH did not identify any unusual or pathogenic
copy-number variants. This suggests that if causative mutations for the
hypermethylation phenotype exist they may be heterogeneous, occurring in several 
different genes, or they may lie within regulatory regions not captured by WES.
Alternatively, hypermethylation may arise from the involvement of multiple genes 
with small effects. To test this hypothesis would require recruitment of large
patient samples and application of genome-wide association studies.

Inflammatory colorectal polyps (ICRPs) frequently occur in miniature dachshunds
(MDs) in Japan, typically form multiple polyps with severe neutrophil
infiltration. ICRPs are speculated as a novel, breed-specific canine inflammatory
bowel disease. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) play an important role in the
differentiation of pathogens from commensal bacteria and food antigens, and
polymorphisms of various PRRs have been shown to be associated with human and
canine IBD. We recently reported that the reactivity of nucleotide-binding
oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2), toll-like receptor (TLR) 1/2, TLR2, and TLR2/6
are greater in ICRP-affected MDs than that in controls. Therefore, this study was
aimed to investigate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of PRRs associated
with ICRPs in MDs. Mutational analysis of canine NOD2, TLR1, TLR2, and TLR6 genes
was performed with six ICRP-affected MDs, five control MDs, and five healthy
beagles. The mutational analysis identified 13 non-synonymous SNPs in NOD2, TLR1,
TLR2, and TLR6 genes, of which six SNPs in NOD2 exon 3 were further analyzed in
an association study using 63 ICRP-affected MDs, 82 control MDs, and 237 control 
dogs of various breeds. Four of the SNPs (A1532G, T1573C, C1688G, and G1880A of
the NOD2 gene) were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and in complete linkage
disequilibrium in MDs, and their minor allele frequencies were significantly
lower in ICRP-affected MDs than in control MDs (0.016 vs. 0.140, P=0.0002). The
calculated inheritance model was an additive model (odds ratio=0.10, 95%
confidence interval=0.02-0.45, P=0.0001), which indicates that the haplotype with
minor alleles in these SNPs (A, T, C, and G in A1532G, T1573C, C1688G, and
G1880A) possess a protective effect regarding the development of ICRPs. However, 
these SNPs were not specific for MDs, although the minor allele frequencies of
these SNPs in control MDs were significantly lower than in other breed dogs.
These results suggest that the identified four SNPs (A1532G, T1573C, C1688G, and 
G1880A in the NOD2 gene) may play a role in the pathogenesis of ICRPs in MDs.
Because the majority of MDs and other breed dogs do not have the protective
alleles, their absence may not be a specific cause of ICRPs in MDs but rather
contribute to the development of inflammation.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Inflammatory bowel disease is a group of chronic
inflammatory conditions affecting gastrointestinal tract. Lots of genes have been
identified resulting in susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease. Any
polymorphism leading to functional modifications in tyrosine kinase-2 may
precipitate excessive immune response in the intestinal mucosa. The aim of our
study is to investigate the involvement of tyrosine kinase-2 polymorphisms in the
patients with inflammatory bowel disease in Turkish population.
METHODS: Four single nucleotide polymorphisms in tyrosine kinase-2 (rs280523,
rs2304256, rs280519 and rs280496) were genotyped in 60 Crohn's disease, 151
ulcerative colitis patients and 89 unrelated healthy controls. These
polymorphisms were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: The presence of genotype (CC) in rs2304256 and (AA) in rs280519 were
found to increase the susceptibility to ulcerative colitis (P=0.024, 0.025,
respectively). rs2304256 (CA) and rs280519 (AG) have provided protection against 
ulcerative colitis (P=0.021, 0.012, respectively). rs280519 (AG) was protective
against Crohn's disease (P=0.045). rs2304256 (CC) increased the susceptibility to
inflammatory Crohn's disease (P=0.014). The presence of rs2304256 (A) increased
the susceptibility to perianal Crohn's disease (P=0.03). Both rs280519 and
rs2304256 polymorphisms were associated with the requirement of corticosteroid
and immunosuppressive therapy in ulcerative colitis.
CONCLUSION: This study is the first demonstration of the single marker
association of tyrosine kinase-2 polymorphisms with ulcerative colitis and
Crohn's disease in Turkish population. They may be effective in the etiology of
inflammatory bowel disease in our population. Disparity between our study and
others may be related to ethnic differences.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is an inflammatory disease of the newborn bowel, 
primarily affecting premature infants. Early intestinal colonization has been
implicated in the pathogenesis of NEC. The objective of this prospective
case-control study was to evaluate differences in the intestinal microbiota
between infants who developed NEC and unaffected controls prior to disease onset.
We conducted longitudinal analysis of the 16S rRNA genes of 312 samples obtained 
from 12 NEC cases and 26 age-matched controls with a median frequency of 7
samples per subject and median sampling interval of 3 days. We found that the
microbiome undergoes dynamic development during the first two months of life with
day of life being the major factor contributing to the colonization process.
Depending on when the infant was diagnosed with NEC (i.e. early vs. late onset), 
the pattern of microbial progression was different for cases and controls. The
difference in the microbiota was most overt in early onset NEC cases and
controls. In proximity to NEC onset, the abundances of Clostridium sensu stricto 
from Clostridia class were significantly higher in early onset NEC subjects
comparing to controls. In late onset NEC, Escherichia/Shigella among
Gammaproteobacteria, showed an increasing pattern prior to disease onset, and was
significantly higher in cases than controls six days before NEC onset.
Cronobacter from Gammaproteobacteria was also significantly higher in late onset 
NEC cases than controls 1-3 days prior to NEC onset. Thus, the specific
infectious agent associated with NEC may vary by the age of infant at disease
onset. We found that intravenously administered antibiotics may have an impact on
the microbial diversity present in fecal material. Longitudinal analysis at
multiple time points was an important strategy utilized in this study, allowing
us to appreciate the dynamics of the premature infant intestinal microbiome while
approaching NEC at various points.

Increased TGF-β1 and TGF-β1-dependent Collagen I production in intestinal
mesenchymal cells result in fibrosis in patients with Montreal B2 fibrostenotic
Crohn's disease. Numerous cytokines, including IL-6, are produced by activated
mesenchymal cells themselves and activate STAT3. The aim of the current study was
to determine the mechanisms by which STAT-3 activation might result in intestinal
fibrosis. Cytokine levels were measured by ELISA. STAT3 and suppressor of
cytokine signaling 3 protein levels were measured by immunoblot, STAT3-TGFB1
DNA-binding activity by chromatin immunoprecipitation, and TGFB1 transcriptional 
activity by luciferase reporter assay. TGF-β1 (TGFB1), Collagen1α1, and
connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) gene expression was measured by
quantitative RT-PCR. The role of STAT3 activation was determined using STAT3
inhibitor, Stattic, and by transfection of STAT3 mutants. Autocrine production of
cytokines was increased in muscle cells of B2 phenotype patients from strictures 
and normal intestine in the same patient and compared with other Crohn's
phenotypes, ulcerative colitis, and non-Crohn's patients. A unique pattern of
STAT3 phosphorylation emerged: high STAT3(S727) and low STAT3(Y705) in strictures
and the opposite in unaffected intestine. TGFB1 transcriptional activity was
regulated by phospho-STAT3(S727) and was decreased by Stattic or
dominant-negative STAT3(S727A). TGF-β1, COL1A1, and CTGF expression was inhibited
by Stattic or dominant-negative STAT3(S727A). Treatment of normal muscle cells
with IL-6 or expression of constitutively active STAT3(S727E) phenocopied muscle 
cells from strictured intestine. Neutralization of autocrine IL-6 reversed STAT3 
phosphorylation and normalized expression of TGF-β1 in strictured intestinal
muscle. The ability of Stattic to improve development of fibrosis was confirmed
in mice with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced colitis. We observed a
unique phospho-STAT3(S727) response in patients with Montreal B2 Crohn's disease,
particularly in response to IL-6 leading to increased TGF-β1, collagen, and CTGF 
production in ileal strictures.

BACKGROUND: Twenty to 25% of the patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
present the disease before the age of 18 to 20, with worse extent and severity,
compared with adult-onset IBD. We sought to identify the differential expression 
of microRNAs in pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC) and their association with
different clinical phenotypes.
METHODS: MicroRNA expression analysis was performed in colonic tissues derived
from pediatric patients with UC and controls without IBD. MiR-4284 levels were
verified by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction in 2 additional
cohorts of pediatric patients with UC. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to
predict the targets of miR-4284. In vitro experiments using luciferase reporter
assays and real-time polymerase chain reaction evaluated the direct effect of
miR-4284 on CXCL5 mRNA. In vivo experiments were performed in 2 mouse models of
experimental colitis.
RESULTS: A 24-microRNA signature was identified in colonic tissues derived from
pediatric patients with UC. The most downregulated microRNA in the tissue of
pediatric patients UC, relative to non-IBD controls, was miR-4284. In situ
hybridization revealed that miR-4284 is present in colonic epithelial cells, and 
its levels correlate with the disease activity. Furthermore, we found that
miR-4284 regulates CXCL5 mRNA expression through binding to its 3'UTR. CXCL5 had 
increased mRNA levels in colonic tissue from pediatric patients with UC and
correlated with disease activity. Furthermore, we found an inverse correlation
between miR-4284 and CXCL5 levels in the colonic pediatric UC tissues and in 2
mouse models of experimental colitis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data reveal a novel microRNA pediatric UC signature and provide 
evidence that miR-4284 directly regulates CXCL5 and correlates with the disease
activity.

OBJECTIVE: Genome wide association studies (GWAS) and meta-analyses for Crohn's
disease (CD) have not fully explained the heritability of CD, suggesting that
additional loci are yet to be found and that the known loci may contain high
effect rare risk variants that have thus far gone undetected by GWAS. While the
cost of deep sequencing remains too high to analyse many samples, targeted
sequencing of pooled DNA samples allows the efficient and cost effective capture 
of all variations in a target region.
DESIGN: We performed pooled sequencing in 500 Korean CD cases and 1000 controls
to evaluate the coding exon and 5' and 3' untranslated regions of 131 CD
associated genes. The identified genetic variants were validated using genotyping
in an independent set of 500 CD cases and 1000 controls.
RESULTS: Pooled sequencing identified 30 common/low single nucleotide variants
(SNVs) in 12 genes and 3 rare SNVs in 3 genes. Our results confirmed a
significant association of CD with the following previously reported risk loci:
rs3810936 in TNFSF15 (OR=1.83, p<2.2×10(-16)), rs76418789 in IL23R (OR=0.47,
p=1.14×10(-8)) and rs2241880 in ATG16L1 (OR=1.30, p=5.28×10(-6)). In addition,
novel loci were identified in TNFSF8 (rs3181374, OR=1.53, p=1.03×10(-14)), BTNL2 
(rs28362680, OR=1.47, p=9.67×10(-11)), HLA-DQA2 (rs3208181, OR=1.36,
p=4.66×10(-6)), STAT3 (rs1053004, OR=1.29, p=2.07×10(-5)), NFKBIA (rs2273650,
OR=0.80, p=3.93×10(-4)), NKX2-3 (rs888208, OR=0.82, p=6.37×10(-4)) and DNAH12
(rs4462937, OR=1.13, p=3.17×10(-2)). A novel rare SNV, rs200735402 in CARD9, was 
shown to have a protective effect (OR=0.09, p=5.28×10(-5)).
CONCLUSIONS: Our deep resequencing of 131 CD associated genes confirmed 3
reported risk loci and identified 8 novel risk loci for CD in Koreans, providing 
new insights into the genetic architecture of CD.

Trichuris suis ova (TSO) have shown promising results in the treatment of
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) but the mechanisms which underlies this
therapeutic effect cannot be studied in mice and rats as T. suis fails to
colonize the rodent intestine, whilst hatching in humans and rabbits. As a
suitable rabbit IBD model is currently not available, we developed a rabbit
colitis model by administration of dextran sodium sulphate (DSS). White Himalayan
rabbits (n = 12) received 0.1% DSS in the daily water supply for five days.
Clinical symptoms were monitored daily, and rabbits were sacrificed at different 
time points. A genomewide expression analysis was performed with RNA isolated
from caecal lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) and intestinal epithelial
cells (IEC). The disease activity index of DSS rabbits increased up to 2.1 ± 0.4 
(n = 6) at day 10 (controls <0.5). DSS induced a caecum-localized pathology with 
crypt architectural distortion, stunted villous surface and inflammatory
infiltrate in the lamina propria. The histopathology score reached a peak of
14.2 ± 4.9 (n = 4) at day 10 (controls 7.7 ± 0.9, n = 5). Expression profiling
revealed an enrichment of IBD-related genes in both LPMC and IEC. Innate
inflammatory response, Th17 signalling and chemotaxis were among the pathways
affected significantly. We describe a reproducible and reliable rabbit model of
DSS colitis. Localization of the inflammation in the caecum and its similarities 
to IBD make this model particularly suitable to study TSO therapy in vivo.

Arg72Pro polymorphism of p53 may predict poor response to medical treatment in
ulcerative colitis.

Vietri MT, Riegler G, Pellino G, Molinari AM, Cioffi M.

AIM: Arg72Pro is a polymorphism commonly occurring in the proline-rich domain of 
Tp53. It can determine the development of different types of cancers, such as
breast, lung, cervical, colorectal and hepatocellular carcinoma. Previous studies
reported a correlation between Pro72 homozygosity and the clinical course of
ulcerative colitis (UC). Our aim was to evaluate Arg72Pro genotype in patients
who underwent proctocolectomy with ileo-pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) for UC
compared with those who did not need surgery.
MATERIAL OF STUDY: The distribution of the different genotype of Arg72Pro was
studied in 264 (234 medically treated [MT] and 30 IPAA) patients affected with UC
observed between 2008 and 2011. IPAA patients underwent restorative
proctocolectomy for refractory UC; MT ones were managed medically. Blood samples 
for genotyping were collected from all patients. Arg72Pro genotype analysis was
carried out by polymerase chain reaction confronting two-pair primers (PCR-CTPP).
RESULTS: In MT patients (n=234) Arg/Arg, Arg/Pro and Pro/Pro frequencies were
51.28%, 41.02% and 7.7%, respectively, while in IPAA patients (n=30) were 53.4%, 
23.3% and 23.3%, respectively. A statistically significant association was found 
between Pro/Pro and need for surgery (p=<0.0059, χ =7.59).
CONCLUSION: Our results showed that the Pro/Pro genotype was higher in IPAA
(23.3%) than in MT (7.7%) patients. In UC patients the proline homozygosity
identifies likeliness to resist to any standard pharmacologic therapy. It could
potentially identify patients who would benefit from early surgical treatment,
thereby reducing the rate of emergency colectomies and complications related to
them.

Publisher: dominio ricco di proline del gene Tp53. Tale polimorfismo può
determinare lo sviluppo di diversi tipi di cancro, quali il tumore della
mammella, del polmone, della cervice, del colon-retto e del fegato. Studi
precedenti hanno riportato un’associazione tra omozigosi Pro72 ed il decorso
clinico della Colite Ulcerosa (CU).Nostro obiettivo è stato valutare il genotipo 
Arg72Pro in pazienti sottoposti a proctocolectomia restaurativa (PR) con pouch
ileale pelvica ed anastomosi ileopouch anale per CU e di confrontare tali dati
con quelli di pazienti affetti da CU responsivi alla terapia medica.Le
distribuzioni dei diversi genotipi di Arg72Pro sono state esaminate in 264
pazienti (234 trattati con terapia medica [TM] e 30 sottoposti a PR).osservati
tra il 2008 ed il 2011. Nei pazienti operati la PR è stata effettuata per
refrattarietà alla terapia medica. In tutti i pazienti sono stati prelevati
campioni ematici ed è stata eseguita l’analisi del genotipo Arg72Pro mediante
polymerase chain reaction con due primer appaiati (PCR-CTPP).Nei pazienti
sottoposti con successo a TM (n=234) abbiamo riscontrato tali distribuzioni:
Arg/Arg 51.28%; Arg/Pro 41.02%; Pro/Pro 7.7%. Nei pazienti che hanno richiesto PR
(n=30) le distribuzioni erano le seguenti Arg/arg 53.4%; Arg/Pro 23.3%; Pro/Pro
23.3%. L’associazione tra Pro/Pro e necessità di chirurgia è risultata
statisticamente significativa (p=<0.0059, χ2=7.59).I nostri risultati dimostrano 
che il genotipo Pro/Pro è maggiormente riscontrato in pazienti sottoposti a PR
(23.3%) che in quelli responsivi a TM (7.7%). Nei pazienti affetti da CU tale
omozigosi identifica verosimile resistenza alla TM, e portebbe essere utilizzata 
per selezionare pazienti che potrebbero beneficiare di un approccio chirurgico
precoce, riducendo – in ultima analisi – il tasso di colectomie d’urgenza e le
relative complicanze.

BACKGROUND: In recent years, an increasing incidence of inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD) has been reported, mainly as Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative
colitis (UC). The individual susceptibility, the disease's course and response to
the applied therapy is likely due to genetic factors such as ABCB1 gene
mutations, exemplified by C3435T polymorphism. The aim of the study was to
evaluate the distribution of C3435T polymorphism regarding the gender in IBD
patients and control subjects from Lower Silesia region and its possible
association with IBD susceptibility.
METHODS: The research was conducted in groups of 61 IBD patients and 101 healthy 
subjects from the Lower Silesia region. Polymorphism of C3435T was determined
using PCR-RFLP method.
RESULTS: Frequency distributions of C3435T genotype and of 3435T or 3435C gene
alleles of IBD, CD or UC patients were compared to control group; each treated as
a whole or split further by gender. The statistically significant correlation was
discovered between gender and C3435T genotype both for IBD and CD patients, with 
3435CT heterozygote prevailing in IBD and CD males. Odds ratio calculations
revealed statistically significant difference for the 3435CT genotype between
control and: IBD group considered as a whole; IBD males; CD males; and for 3435TT
variant between control and IBD males. Conclusions. The 3435CT genotype could be 
a risk factor for IBD and CD in men. The 3435TT genotype in males seems to be
associated with the lower chance of IBD presence.

AIM: To see if SNPs could help predict response to biological therapy using
adalimumab (ADA) in Crohn's disease (CD).
MATERIALS & METHODS: IBDQ index and CRP levels were used to monitor therapy
response. We genotyped 31 CD-associated genes in 102 Slovenian CD patients.
RESULTS: The strongest association for treatment response defined as decrease in 
CRP levels was found for ATG16L1 SNP rs10210302. Additional SNPs in 7 out of 31
tested CD-associated genes (PTGER4, CASP9, IL27, C11orf30, CCNY, IL13, NR1I2)
showed suggestive association with ADA response.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest ADA response in CD patients is genetically
predisposed by SNPs in CD risk genes and suggest ATG16L1 as most promising
candidate gene for drug response in ADA treatment. Original submitted 24

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Defects in colonic epithelial barrier defenses are associated 
with ulcerative colitis (UC). The proteins that regulate bacterial clearance in
the colonic epithelium have not been completely identified. The Drosophila
chromosome-associated protein D3 (dCAP-D3) regulates responses to bacterial
infection. We examined whether CAP-D3 promotes bacterial clearance in human
colonic epithelium.
METHODS: Clearance of Salmonella or adherent-invasive Escherichia coli LF82 was
assessed by gentamycin protection assays in HT-29 and Caco-2 cells expressing
small hairpin RNAs against CAP-D3. We used immunoblot assays to measure levels of
CAP-D3 in colonic epithelial cells from patients with UC and healthy individuals 
(controls). RNA sequencing identified genes activated by CAP-D3. We analyzed the 
roles of CAP-D3 target genes in bacterial clearance using gentamycin protection
and immunofluorescence assays and studies with pharmacologic inhibitors.
RESULTS: CAP-D3 expression was reduced in colonic epithelial cells from patients 
with active UC. Reduced CAP-D3 expression decreased autophagy and impaired
intracellular bacterial clearance by HT-29 and Caco-2 colonic epithelial cells.
Lower levels of CAP-D3 increased transcription of genes encoding SLC7A5 and
SLC3A2, the products of which heterodimerize to form an amino acid transporter in
HT-29 cells after bacterial infection; levels of SLC7A5-SLC3A2 were increased in 
tissues from patients with UC compared with controls. Reduced CAP-D3 in HT-29
cells resulted in earlier recruitment of SLC7A5 to Salmonella-containing
vacuoles, increased activity of mTORC1, and increased survival of bacteria.
Inhibition of SLC7A5-SLC3A2 or mTORC1 activity rescued the bacterial clearance
defects of CAP-D3-deficient cells.
CONCLUSIONS: CAP-D3 down-regulates transcription of genes that encode amino acid 
transporters (SLC7A5 and SLC3A2) to promote bacterial autophagy by colon
epithelial cells. Levels of CAP-D3 protein are reduced in patients with active
UC; strategies to increase its levels might restore mucosal homeostasis to
patients with active UC.

Claudins constitute a family of at least 27 proteins with four transmembrane
domains, and play a pivotal role in maintaining tight-junctions seals in diverse 
epithelial tissues. The expression of claudin-4 often changes in intestinal
tissues of inflammatory bowel disease and various human cancers. Therefore,
claudin-4 is a promising target for treatment of these diseases. In our previous 
study, we established a reporter cell line to monitor claudin-4 expression on the
basis of a functional claudin-4 promoter. Using this cell line, we have performed
a cell-based screen of a library containing 2642 biologically active
small-molecule compounds to identify modulators of claudin-4 expression. The
screen identified 24 potential modulators of the claudin-4 promoter activity.
Fourteen of these compounds (12 of them novel) induced endogenous claudin-4
expression. The identified compounds might serve as lead compounds targeting
aberrant gene expression in inflammatory bowel disease.

Genetic alterations in the TGFβ signaling pathway in combination with oncogenic
alterations lead to cancer development in the intestines. However, the mechanisms
of TGFβ signaling suppression in malignant progression of intestinal tumors have 
not yet been fully understood. We have examined Apc(Δ716) Tgfbr2(ΔIEC) compound
mutant mice that carry mutations in Apc and Tgfbr2 genes in the intestinal
epithelial cells. We found inflammatory microenvironment only in the invasive
intestinal adenocarcinomas but not in noninvasive benign polyps of the same mice.
We thus treated simple Tgfbr2(ΔIEC) mice with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) that
causes ulcerative colitis. Importantly, these Tgfbr2(ΔIEC) mice developed
invasive colon cancer associated with chronic inflammation. We also found that
TGFβ signaling is suppressed in human colitis-associated colon cancer cells. In
the mouse invasive tumors, macrophages infiltrated and expressed MT1-MMP, causing
MMP2 activation. These results suggest that inflammatory microenvironment
contributes to submucosal invasion of TGFβ signaling-repressed epithelial cells
through activation of MMP2. We further found that regeneration was impaired in
Tgfbr2(ΔIEC) mice for intestinal mucosa damaged by DSS treatment or X-ray
irradiation, resulting in the expansion of undifferentiated epithelial cell
population. Moreover, organoids of intestinal epithelial cells cultured from
irradiated Tgfbr2(ΔIEC) mice formed "long crypts" in Matrigel, suggesting
acquisition of an invasive phenotype into the extracellular matrix. These
results, taken together, indicate that a simple genetic alteration in the TGFβ
signaling pathway in the inflamed and regenerating intestinal mucosa can cause
invasive intestinal tumors. Such a mechanism may play a role in the colon
carcinogenesis associated with inflammatory bowel disease in humans.

Primary gastrointestinal (GI) lymphomas are uncommon diseases that can involve
the whole GI tract. The etiologies of the disease remain unclear, and potential
risk factors include celiac disease, Helicobacter pylori infection, use of
immunosuppressive agents, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or Epstein-Barr
virus (EBV) infection and inflammatory bowel disease, etc. Diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma (DLBCL) and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma are the
most common subtypes of GI lymphomas. B-cell lymphomas of the GI tract are more
common in Western countries, while in Asia-Pacific region T-cell lymphomas are
more frequently reported. In this review, lymphomas in the esophagus, stomach and
intestine are described, including their epidemiology, histology, clinical
manifestations, endoscopic findings, radiological features and treatment.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the interaction of the polymorphisms of
cyclooxygenase-2-1195G/A (COX-2-1195G/A) and manganese superoxide dismutase
9Ala/Val (MnSOD9Ala/Val) genes and the high-fat diets and its potential
correlation with ulcerative colitis (UC).
METHODS: The genetic polymorphisms of COX-2-1195G/A and MnSOD9Ala/Val were
analyzed by polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in peripheral blood
leukocytes obtained from 750 UC patients (UC group) and 750 healthy subjects
(control group).
RESULTS: The frequencies of COX-2-1195G/A(A/A) and MnSOD9Ala/Val(V/V) were 49.07%
and 50.13% in UC group and 21.20% and 22.40% in control group, respectively
(P<0.01). The risk of UC significantly increased in subjects with
COX-2-1195G/A(A/A) genotype (OR=3.5808,95%CI=1.8062-5.3478) and in those with
MnSOD9Ala/Val(V/V) genotype(OR=3.4828,95%CI=1.9137-5.5496). Pooled analysis of
the polymorphisms showed that distribution frequency of
COX-2-1195G/A(A/A)/MnSOD9Ala/Val (V/V) was 40.67% in UC group and 8.40% in
control group (P<0.01). Subjects with COX-2-1195G/A(A/A)/MnSOD9Ala/Val(V/V) had a
significantly higher risk of UC (OR=7.5655,95% CI=4.1849-11.2037). The rate of
high-fat diets was significantly higher in the UC group than in the control
group(49.73 vs.20.13%,P<0.01),and statistic analysis suggested an interaction
between high-fat diet and COX-2-1195G/A(A/A)(Γ=11.81821)and MnSOD9Ala/Val
(V/V)(Γ=9.0107), which increase risk of UC.
CONCLUSIONS: COX-2-1195G/A(A/A),MnSOD9Ala/Val (V/V), and high-fat diet are the
risk factors of UC. The interaction between the genetic polymorphisms of
COX-2-1195G/A and MnSOD9Ala/Val and the high-fat diet increases the risk of UC.

OBJECTIVE: While it's widely accepted that the etiology of ulcerative colitis
(UC) involves both genetic and environmental factors, the pathogenesis of
ulcerative colitis is still poorly understood. Intestinal epithelial apoptosis is
one of the most common histopathological changes of UC and the expression of a
number of apoptosis genes may contribute to the progression of UC. MicroRNAs have
recently emerged as powerful regulators of diverse cellular processes and have
been shown to be involved in many immune-mediated disorders such as psoriasis,
rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and asthma. A unique microRNA expression profile has
been identified in UC, suggesting that, microRNAs play an important role in the
pathogenesis of UC. We investigated the role of miR-29a in intestinal epithelial 
apoptosis in UC.
METHODS: The expression of miR-29a and Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family
member, was evaluated in both UC patients and UC mice model induced by dextran
sodium sulfate (DSS). The apoptosis rate of intestinal epithelial cells was also 
evaluated.
RESULTS: In UC patients and DSS-induced UC in mice, the expression of miR-29a and
Mcl-1, were up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively. We identified a
miR-29a binding site (7 nucleotides) on the 3'UTR of mcl-1 and mutation in this
binding site on the 3'UTR of mcl-1 led to mis-match between miR-29a and mcl-1.
Knockout of Mcl-1 caused apoptosis of the colonic epithelial HT29 cells. In
addition, miR-29a regulated intestinal epithelial apoptosis by down-regulating
the expression of Mcl-1.
CONCLUSION: miR-29a is involved in the pathogenesis of UC by regulating
intestinal epithelial apoptosis via Mcl-1.

Nrf2, a master regulator of detoxification and also antioxidant,
anti-inflammatory and other cytoprotective mechanisms, is raised by health
promoting factors.

The transcription factor Nrf2, nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2,
activates the transcription of over 500 genes in the human genome, most of which 
have cytoprotective functions. Nrf2 produces cytoprotection by detoxification
mechanisms leading to increased detoxification and excretion of both organic
xenobiotics and toxic metals; its action via over two dozen genes increases
highly coordinated antioxidant activities; it produces major anti-inflammatory
changes; it stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis and otherwise improves
mitochondrial function; and it stimulates autophagy, removing toxic protein
aggregates and dysfunctional organelles. Health-promoting nutrients and other
factors act, at least in part by raising Nrf2 including: many phenolic
antioxidants; gamma- and delta-tocopherols and tocotrienols; long chain omega-3
fatty acids DHA and EPA; many carotenoids of which lycopene may be the most
active; isothiocyanates from cruciferous vegetables; sulfur compounds from allium
vegetables; terpenoids. Other health promoting, Nrf2 raising factors include low 
level oxidative stress (hormesis), exercise and caloric restriction. Raising Nrf2
has been found to prevent and/or treat a large number of chronic inflammatory
diseases in animal models and/or humans including various cardiovascular
diseases, kidney diseases, lung diseases, diseases of toxic liver damage, cancer 
(prevention), diabetes/metabolic syndrome/obesity, sepsis, autoimmune diseases,
inflammatory bowel disease, HIV/AIDS and epilepsy. Lesser evidence suggests that 
raising Nrf2 may lower 16 other diseases. Many of these diseases are probable
NO/ONOO(-) cycle diseases and Nrf2 lowers effects of NO/ONOO(-) cycle elements.
The most healthful diets known, traditional Mediterranean and Okinawan, are rich 
in Nrf2 raising nutrients as apparently was the Paleolithic diet that our
ancestors ate. Modern diets are deficient in such nutrients. Nrf2 is argued to be
both lifespan and healthspan extending. Possible downsides to too much Nrf2 are
also discussed. Nrf2 is not a magic bullet but is likely to be of great
importance in health promotion, particularly in those regularly exposed to toxic 
chemicals.

The contribution of rare coding sequence variants to genetic susceptibility in
complex disorders is an important but unresolved question. Most studies thus far 
have investigated a limited number of genes from regions which contain common
disease associated variants. Here we investigate this in inflammatory bowel
disease by sequencing the exons and proximal promoters of 531 genes selected from
both genome-wide association studies and pathway analysis in pooled DNA panels
from 474 cases of Crohn's disease and 480 controls. 80 variants with evidence of 
association in the sequencing experiment or with potential functional
significance were selected for follow up genotyping in 6,507 IBD cases and 3,064 
population controls. The top 5 disease associated variants were genotyped in an
extension panel of 3,662 IBD cases and 3,639 controls, and tested for association
in a combined analysis of 10,147 IBD cases and 7,008 controls. A rare coding
variant p.G454C in the BTNL2 gene within the major histocompatibility complex was
significantly associated with increased risk for IBD (p = 9.65x10-10, OR =
2.3[95% CI = 1.75-3.04]), but was independent of the known common associated CD
and UC variants at this locus. Rare (<1%) and low frequency (1-5%) variants in 3 
additional genes showed suggestive association (p<0.005) with either an increased
risk (ARIH2 c.338-6C>T) or decreased risk (IL12B p.V298F, and NICN p.H191R) of
IBD. These results provide additional insights into the involvement of the
inhibition of T cell activation in the development of both sub-phenotypes of
inflammatory bowel disease. We suggest that although rare coding variants may
make a modest overall contribution to complex disease susceptibility, they can
inform our understanding of the molecular pathways that contribute to
pathogenesis.

AIM: To investigate IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-1R , IL-4RA, TGF-β, TNF-α and IFN-γ, genes
polymorphism in Turkish patients with ucerative colitis (UC).
METHODS: An analysis was carried out at Trabzon Karadeniz Technical University
Medicine Faculty Gastroenterology polyclinics between March 2005 and May 2011 on 
51 patient with UC (cases) and 100 healthy individuals (controls). PCR-SSP and
cytokine gene panel (Helderberg kits) based techniques for analysis of gene
polymorphisms were used.
RESULTS: Changes in allelic frequencies of each of the investigated eight
cytokine genes polymorphisms in patient with ulcerative colitis were found. Among
the allelic genes analyzed here, the highest statistically significant change was
observed in the position TNF-α -308 G/A (339.7%). The following increases were
observed in IL-IR mspa T/C variation (179.4%), IFN-γ 5644A/T variation (77.4%),
and in IL-1β -511T/C SNPs (35.9% ). In other analyzed genes, allelic changes were
found to be decreasing for TGF- β codon10C / T (-71.9%), IL4RA + 1902G / A (-47.3
%), and for IL- 1α -889T / C (-37.7%). The lowest negative change (-25.9%) was
observed in the allele frequency in IL- 1β 3962T / C (p les than 0.000). In
addition, there were changes in genotypic frequencies investigated seven gene
polymophic site and only one of cytokine gene IL-1β 3962TT/TC/CC was not changed.
CONCLUSION: Genes polymorphism is not itself the only determining factor for
clinical diagnoses. However, it can be used in the clinical diagnosis of UC in
order to determine the low level or high level variations in cytokine gene
polymorphisms.

Ileal lesions of patients with Crohn's disease are colonized by adherent-invasive
Escherichia coli (AIEC), which is able to adhere to and to invade intestinal
epithelial cells (IEC), to replicate within macrophages, and to form biofilms on 
the surface of the intestinal mucosa. Previous analyses indicated the involvement
of the σ(E) pathway in AIEC-IEC interaction, as well as in biofilm formation,
with σ(E) pathway inhibition leading to an impaired ability of AIEC to colonize
the intestinal mucosa and to form biofilms. The aim of this study was to
characterize the σ(E) regulon of AIEC strain LF82 in order to identify members
involved in AIEC phenotypes. Using comparative in silico analysis of the σ(E)
regulon, we identified the waaWVL operon as a new member of the σ(E) regulon in
reference AIEC strain LF82. We determined that the waaWVL operon is involved in
AIEC lipopolysaccharide structure and composition, and the waaWVL operon was
found to be essential for AIEC strains to produce biofilm and to colonize the
intestinal mucosa.IMPORTANCE: An increased prevalence of adherent-invasive
Escherichia coli (AIEC) bacteria was previously observed in the intestinal mucosa
of Crohn's disease (CD) patients, and clinical observations revealed bacterial
biofilms associated with the mucosa of CD patients. Here, analysis of the σ(E)
regulon in AIEC and commensal E. coli identified 12 genes controlled by σ(E) only
in AIEC. Among them, WaaWVL factors were found to play an essential role in
biofilm formation and mucosal colonization by AIEC. In addition to identifying
molecular tools that revealed a pathogenic population of E. coli colonizing the
mucosa of CD patients, these results indicate that targeting the waaWVL operon
could be a potent therapeutic strategy to interfere with the ability of AIEC to
form biofilms and to colonize the gut mucosa.

BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is typically diagnosed at 20 to 40
years of age. However, very young versus elderly patients with IBD may have
different mechanisms of disease that may affect prognosis and care.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this work was to identify single nucleotide
polymorphisms associated with age of onset of Crohn's disease and ulcerative
colitis.
DESIGN: Patients were genotyped using a custom microarray chip containing 332
IBD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms. Age at diagnosis as a continuous 
variable was assessed using linear regression. Patients were then subgrouped by
age at diagnosis and compared by the Fisher exact test. Bonferroni correction was
used in all of the analyses.
SETTINGS: This study was conducted at a tertiary academic hospital.
PATIENTS: Sixty patients with Crohn's disease and 26 with ulcerative colitis were
≤ 16 years old, 259 patients with Crohn's disease and 248 with ulcerative colitis
were 17-60 years old, and 10 patients with Crohn's disease and 20 with ulcerative
colitis were >60 years old at diagnosis and included in this study.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Age at diagnosis and single nucleotide polymorphism
correlations were measured in this study.
RESULTS: The NOD2 single nucleotide polymorphism rs2076756 was associated with
younger age at Crohn's disease diagnosis (p = 0.0002). Patients with the
AA/wild-type genotype were diagnosed at 31.9 ± 1.23 years, AG heterozygotes at
25.6 ± 0.99 years, and GG/at-risk allele homozygotes at 22.6 ± 1.32 years.
Depending on age categories compared, single nucleotide polymorphisms in POU5F1, 
TNFSF15, and HLA DRB1*501 were associated with age of Crohn's disease diagnosis. 
No genetic associations were seen between ulcerative colitis and linear age at
diagnosis; however, the G allele of the LAMB1 single nucleotide polymorphism
rs886774 was found to be associated with ulcerative colitis diagnosed at ≤ 16
versus >17 years old (p = 0.008).
LIMITATIONS: This study was limited to known IBD single nucleotide polymorphisms.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis reaffirms the association between NOD2, a molecule of 
innate immunity, and early Crohn's disease onset. This is the first report of a
possible association between early Crohn's disease and the POU5F1, TNFSF15, and
HLA DRB1*501 genes. The LAMB1 gene, associated with mucosal basement membrane
integrity, was associated with early onset ulcerative colitis and, thus, suggests
a fundamentally different mechanism of early disease pathogenesis in ulcerative
colitis versus Crohn's disease.

A total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is considered
the surgery of choice for definitive management of familial adenomatous polyposis
(FAP) and some patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). However, this surgical
treatment is often associated with pouchitis, a long-term complication that
occurs mostly in UC patients. The purpose of this study was to better define the 
molecular background of pouchitis. A microarray-based survey was performed using 
pouch mucosal samples collected from 28 and 8 patients undergoing surgery for UC 
and FAP, respectively. There were 4,770 genes that significantly differentiated
uninflamed from inflamed mucosal samples, and their functional features were
represented mostly by metabolic and cell proliferation pathways. In contrast,
functional analyses of aberrantly expressed genes between UC and FAP samples,
irrespective of mucosal inflammation status, revealed multiple pathways and terms
that were linked to changes in immune response. Interestingly, the comparison of 
uninflamed UC and FAP samples identified a set of 29 altered probe sets,
including an inflammation-related transcript encoding a Charcot-Leyden crystal
(CLC) protein. The most distinct changes in gene expression profiles
differentiating uninflamed UC and FAP pouch mucosal samples were attributed to
the Gene Ontology category innate immune response. Our study confirmed that
alterations in immune responses can be found between patients who underwent
surgery for UC and FAP, independent of the pouch inflammation status. This
observation may be important when managing IPAA patients.

NCX1 is a Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger, which is believed to provide a key route for
basolateral Ca(2+) efflux in the renal epithelia, thus contributing to renal
Ca(2+) reabsorption. Altered mineral homeostasis, including intestinal and renal 
Ca(2+) transport may represent a significant component of the pathophysiology of 
the bone mineral density loss associated with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD). 
The objective of our research was to investigate the effects of TNBS and DSS
colitis and related inflammatory mediators on renal Ncx1 expression. Colitis was 
associated with decreased renal Ncx1 expression, as examined by real-time RT-PCR,
Western blotting, and immunofluorescence. In mIMCD3 cells, IFNγ significantly
reduced Ncx1 mRNA and protein expression. Similar effects were observed in cells 
transiently transfected with a reporter construct bearing the promoter region of 
the kidney-specific Ncx1 gene. This inhibitory effect of IFNγ is mediated by
STAT1 recruitment to the proximal promoter region of Ncx1. Further in vivo study 
with Stat1(-/-) mice confirmed that STAT1 is indeed required for the IFNγ
mediated Ncx1 gene regulation. These results strongly support the hypothesis that
impaired renal Ca(2+) handling occurs in experimental colitis. Negative
regulation of NCX1- mediated renal Ca(2+) absorption by IFNγ may significantly
contribute to the altered Ca(2+) homeostasis in IBD patients and to
IBD-associated loss of bone mineral density.

Humans have coevolved with their microbes over thousands of years, but this
relationship, is now being dramatically affected by shifts in the collective
human microbiome resulting from changes in the environment and societal norms.
Resulting perturbations of intestinal host-microbe interactions can lead to
miscues and altered host responses that increase the risk of pathogenic processes
and promote "western" disorders such as inflammatory bowel diseases, cancers,
obesity, diabetes, autism, and asthma. Given the current challenges and
limitations in gene therapy, approaches that can reshape the gut microbiome
represent a reasonable strategy for restoring the balance between host and
microbes. In this review and commentary, we highlight recent progress in our
understanding of the intestinal microbiome in the context of health and diseases,
focusing on mechanistic concepts that underlie the complex relationships between 
host and microbes. Despite these gains, many challenges lie ahead that make it
difficult to close the gap between the basic sciences and clinical application.
We will discuss the potential therapeutic strategies that can be used to
manipulate the gut microbiota, recognizing that the promise of pharmabiotics
("bugs to drugs") is unlikely to be completely fulfilled without a greater
understanding of enteric microbiota and its impact on mammalian physiology. By
leveraging the knowledge gained through these studies, we will be prepared to
enter the era of personalized medicine where clinical inventions can be
custom-tailored to individual patients to achieve better outcomes.

INTRODUCTION: Cystic Fibrosis (CF), Ulcerative Colitis (UC), and Crohn's Disease 
(CD) manifest as various, multiple symptoms from malfunctioning and/or damaged
gastrointestinal tract, which plague the patients. These symptoms result from the
dysfunctional expression products of the specific mutations of the genes, which
either manifest upon birth (CF) or later in life in immuno-genetically
susceptible individuals as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). They all may
potentially lead to malnutrition of the patients. Since only correcting the
mutated genes, may cure these diseases permanently, the works on the future safe 
gene therapies continue vigorously. However, provision of the necessary nutrients
to the suffering patients is the requirement for an effective, supportive care at
present. In this realm, we have developed a model of the diseased
gastrointestinal tract aimed to guide designing and testing various nutritional
therapies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: It is well known that inflammatory bowel diseases induce
crypts within the patients' gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, we have
bioengineered, a novel, three-dimensional model of the gastrointestinal tract to 
evaluate the rheology of different types of nutrients. The model was assembled
out of the bio-inert polymer tube with openings leading to vials of different
shapes and sizes, as the simulation of the gastrointestinal tract altered by the 
diseases to contain multiple crypts.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The newly developed three-dimensional model effectively 
simulates the structure and functions of the gastrointestinal tract of the
patients with mild and severe Ulcerative Colitis, Crohn's Disease, and Cystic
Fibrosis. This model should allow us to design and test different nutritional
supplements, with properties complementing the pathologically altered by the
diseases functionalities of the patients' gastrointestinal tracts. Therefore, it 
should help us to design the effective supportive therapies; thus to prevent the 
patients' malnutrition.

Within each bacterial species, different strains may vary in the set of genes
they encode or in the copy number of these genes. Yet, taxonomic characterization
of the human microbiota is often limited to the species level or to previously
sequenced strains, and accordingly, the prevalence of intra-species variation,
its functional role, and its relation to host health remain unclear. Here, we
present a comprehensive large-scale analysis of intra-species copy-number
variation in the gut microbiome, introducing a rigorous computational pipeline
for detecting such variation directly from shotgun metagenomic data. We uncover a
large set of variable genes in numerous species and demonstrate that this
variation has significant functional and clinically relevant implications. We
additionally infer intra-species compositional profiles, identifying population
structure shifts and the presence of yet uncharacterized variants. Our results
highlight the complex relationship between microbiome composition and functional 
capacity, linking metagenome-level compositional shifts to strain-level
variation.

[Epidemiology, risk factors and factors associated with disabling course in
inflammatory bowel disease].

[Article in French]

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are not rare and would affect near of 5 million
of patients in the world (including 2.5 in North America and 2.5 in Europe with
at least 200,000 in France). These are chronic relapsing disorders affecting
young patients (peak of incidence in patients aged from 20 to 30 years),
particularly the young females (sex ratio F/M: 1.3). Their cause is unknown and
there is no curative treatment. Although many research studies have isolated more
than 160 genes whose variants are associated with these diseases, the weight of
genetics remains low in their occurrence. Significant time and space variations
in incidence of IBD have been reported. Firstly, an increase of IBD incidence has
been reported overtime worldwide. Secondly, a space variation in IBD incidence
has been noted with a dramatic increase in emerging countries. Even within a same
geographical area through a prospective population-based dataset since 27 years
(EPIMAD Registry), a spatial heterogeneity of incidence has been reported,
suggesting the important role of the environment in the occurrence of these
diseases. Smoking and appendectomy are the only environmental factors clearly
involved in the development and progression of IBD and cannot explain spatial and
temporal heterogeneity in the IBD observed incidence worldwide. New
multidisciplinary basic and epidemiological studies are needed to identify the
factors involved in the onset of IBD.

BACKGROUND: Muc2-deficient mice show no signs of ileal pathology but the
mechanisms remained unknown.
METHODS: Wild-type (WT), Muc2, and Muc2 mice were killed at 2, 4, and 8 weeks of 
age. Total RNA from ileum was used for full genome transcriptome analysis and
qPCR. Microbiota composition was determined using a mouse intestinal chip
(MITChip). Morphological and immunohistological studies were performed on
segments of ileum.
RESULTS: The ileum was colonized by more diverse microbiota in young (week 4) WT 
than in Muc2 mice, and composition was influenced by genotype. Weaning was
associated with major changes in the transcriptome of all mice, and the highest
number of differentially expressed genes compared with adults, reflecting
temporal changes in microbiota. Although the spatial compartmentalization of
bacteria was compromised in Muc2 mice, gene set enrichment analysis revealed a
downregulation of Toll-like receptor, immune, and chemokine signaling pathways
compared to WT mice. The predicted effects of enhanced IL-22 signaling were
identified in the Muc2 transcriptome as the upregulation of epithelial cell
proliferation altered expression of mitosis and cell-cycle control pathways. This
is consistent with increased villus length and number of Ki67 epithelial cells in
Muc2 mice. Additionally, expression of the network of IL-22 regulated defense
genes, including Fut2, Reg3β, Reg3γ, Relmb, and the Defensin Defb46 were
increased in Muc2 mice.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight a role for the IL-22-STAT3 pathway in
maintaining ileal homeostasis when the mucus barrier is compromised and its
potential as a target for novel therapeutic strategies in inflammatory bowel
disease.

Although predominantly associated with health benefits, the gut microbiota has
also been shown to harbor genes that promote inflammation. In this work, we
report a method for the direct detection and quantification of these
pro-inflammatory bacterial genes by PCR and qPCR in DNA extracted from human
stool samples. PCR reactions were performed to detect (i) the pks island genes,
(ii) tcpC, which is present in some strains of Escherichia coli and (iii) gelE
presented in some strains of Enterococcus faecalis. Additionally, we screened for
the presence of the following genes encoding cyclomodulins that disrupted
mammalian cell division: (iv) cdt (which encodes the cytolethal distending toxin)
and (v) cnf-1 (which encodes the cytotoxic necrotizing factor-1). Our results
show that 20% of the samples (N = 41) tested positive for detectable amounts of
pks island genes, whereas 10% of individuals were positive for tcpC or gelE and
only one individual was found to harbor the cnf-1 gene. Of the 13 individuals
that were positive for at least one of the pro-inflammatory genes, 5 were found
to harbor more than one. A quantitative version of the assay, which used
real-time PCR, revealed the pro-inflammatory genes to be in high copy numbers: up
to 1.3 million copies per mg of feces for the pks island genes. Direct detection 
of specific genes in stool could prove useful toward screening for the presence
of pro-inflammatory bacterial genes in individuals with inflammatory bowel
diseases or colorectal cancer.

Sleep deprivation (SD) is an epidemic phenomenon in modern countries, and its
harmful effects are well known. SD acts as an aggravating factor in inflammatory 
bowel disease. Melatonin is a sleep-related neurohormone, also known to have
antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in the gastrointestinal tract; however,
the effects of melatonin on colitis have been poorly characterized. Thus, in this
study, we assessed the measurable effects of SD on experimental colitis and the
protective effects of melatonin. For this purpose, male imprinting control region
(ICR) mice (n = 24) were used; the mice were divided into 4 experimental groups
as follows: the control, colitis, colitis with SD and colitis with SD and
melatonin groups. Colitis was induced by the administration of 5% dextran sulfate
sodium (DSS) in the drinking water for 6 days. The mice were sleep-deprived for 3
days. Changes in body weight, histological analyses of colon tissues and the
expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and genes were evaluated. SD
aggravated inflammation and these effects were reversed by melatonin in the mice 
with colitis. In addition, weight loss in the mice with colitis with SD was
significantly reduced by the injection of melatonin. Treatment with melatonin led
to high survival rates in the mice, in spite of colitis with SD. The levels of
pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-17,
interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α, in the serum of mice were significantly
increased by SD and reduced by melatonin treatment. The melatonin-treated group
showed a histological improvement of inflammation. Upon gene analysis, the
expression of the inflammatory genes, protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ) and calmodulin 3
(CALM3), was increased by SD, and the levels decreased following treatment with
melatonin. The expression levels of the apoptosis-related inducible nitric oxide 
synthase (iNOS) and wingless-type MMTV integration site family, member 5A (Wnt5a)
genes was decreased by SD, but increased following treatment with melatonin.
Treatment with melatonin reduced weight loss and prolonged survival in mice with 
colitis with SD. Melatonin exerted systemic anti-inflammatory effects. Gene
analysis revealed a possible mechanism of action of melatonin in inflammation and
sleep disturbance. Thus, melatonin may be clinically applicable for patients with
inflammatory bowel disease, particularly those suffering from sleep disturbances.

Different mechanisms contribute to the development of sporadic, hereditary and
colitis-associated colorectal cancer. Inhibitor of DNA binding/differentiation
(Id) proteins act as dominant-negative antagonists of basic helix-loop-helix
transcription factors. Id1 is a promising target for cancer therapy, but little
is known about its role in the development of colon cancer. We used
immunohistochemistry to demonstrate that Id1 is overexpressed in human colorectal
adenomas and carcinomas, whether sporadic or syndromic. Furthermore, elevated Id1
levels were found in dysplasia and colon cancer arising in patients with
inflammatory bowel disease. Because levels of PGE2 are also elevated in both
colitis and colorectal neoplasia, we determined whether PGE2 could induce Id1.
PGE2 via EP4 stimulated protein kinase A activity resulting in enhanced
pCREB-mediated Id1 transcription in human colonocytes. To determine the role of
Id1 in carcinogenesis, two mouse models were used. Consistent with the findings
in humans, Id1 was overexpressed in tumors arising in both Apc(Min) (/+) mice, a 
model of familial adenomatous polyposis, and in experimental colitis-associated
colorectal neoplasia. Id1 deficiency led to significant decrease in the number of
intestinal tumors in Apc(Min) (/+) mice and prolonged survival. In contrast, Id1 
deficiency did not affect the number or size of tumors in the model of
colitis-associated colorectal neoplasia, likely due to exacerbation of colitis
associated with Id1 loss. Collectively, these results suggest that Id1 plays a
role in gastrointestinal carcinogenesis. Our findings also highlight the need for
different strategies to reduce the risk of colitis-associated colorectal cancer
compared with sporadic or hereditary colorectal cancer.

[The phenomenon of vitamin D].

[Article in Polish]

The receptor of vitamin D (VDR) is present in most non-skeletal human cells,
suggesting its role beyond the bone and calcium metabolism. The relationship
between vitamin D and the respiratory tract is a consequence of its activity in
the immune system. Some gastrointestinal diseases, such as inflammatory bowel
disease, coeliac disease, liver, pancreas or cardiac diseases, lead to vitamin D 
deficiency. Many studies indicate a correlation between vitamin D and diabetes.
VDR and 1α-hydroxylase have been detected in the cutaneous capillary vessels,
endothelium, vascular smooth muscles, myocytes and cardiac fibroblasts. The
influence of vitamin D on the expression of genes related to the vascular walls
implies its role in the pathomechanisms of vascular diseases and the
cardiovascular system. Due to the VDR detected in most immunocompetent cells,
calcitriol can modulate the congenital and acquired immune system. The
correlation between vitamin D and cancer development is also not surprising
because of many functions which vitamin D has in the organism. The vitamin
D-regulated genes encode the proteins which participate in differentiation,
proliferation or apoptosis. This paper aims to focus on the less well known roles
of vitamin D in the organism, especially considering that most "sun consumers"
know only its antirachitic and bone reinforcing action. So, this article may be
surprising, and first of all it should convince everyone to vitamin D
supplemention.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the most lethal human cancers, but the mechanism
of the cancer is still unclear enough. We aimed to explore the key genes in CRC
progression. The gene expression profile (GSE4183) of CRC was obtained from Gene 
Expression Omnibus database which included 8 normal samples, 15 adenoma samples, 
15 CRC samples and 15 inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) samples. Thereinto, 8
normal, 15 adenoma, and 15 CRC samples were chosen for our research. The
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in normal vs. adenoma, normal vs. CRC, and 
adenoma vs. CRC, were identified using the Wilcoxon test method in R
respectively. The interactive network of DEGs was constructed to select the
significant modules using the Pearson's correlation. Meanwhile, transcriptional
network of DEGs was also constructed using the g: Profiler. Totally, 2,741 DEGs
in normal vs. adenoma, 1,484 DEGs in normal vs. CRC, and 396 DEGs in adenoma vs. 
CRC were identified. Moreover, function analysis of DEGs in each group showed
FcR-mediated phagocytosis pathway in module 1, cardiac muscle contraction pathway
in module 6, and Jak-STAT signaling pathway in module 19 were also enriched.
Furthermore, MZF1 and AP2 were the transcription factor in module 6, with the
target SP1, while SP1 was also a transcription in module 20. DEGs like NCF1, AKT,
SP1, AP2, MZF1, and TPM might be used as specific biomarkers in CRC development. 
Therapy targeting on the functions of these key genes might provide novel
perspective for CRC treatment.

Polymorphisms attenuating IL-10 signalling confer genetic risk for inflammatory
bowel disease. Yet, how IL-10 prevents mucosal autoinflammation is incompletely
understood. We demonstrate using lineage-specific deletions of IL-10Rα that IL-10
acts primarily through macrophages to limit colitis. Colitis depends on IL-6 to
support pathologic Th17 cell generation in wild-type mice. However, specific
ablation of macrophage IL-10Rα provokes excessive IL-1β production that overrides
Th17 IL-6 dependency, amplifying the colonic Th17 response and disease severity. 
IL-10 not only inhibits pro-IL-1β production transcriptionally in macrophages,
but suppresses caspase-1 activation and caspase-1-dependent maturation of
pro-IL-1β to IL-1β. Therefore, lineage-specific effects of IL-10 skew the
cytokine dependency of Th17 cell development required for colitis pathogenesis.
Coordinated interventions may be needed to fully suppress Th17-mediated
immunopathology.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is the common name for numerous relapsing
inflammatory conditions, and is the collective name for Crohn's disease (CD) and 
ulcerative colitis (UC). The activation of the inflammasome in the pathogenesis
of IBD has recently been identified, however the underlying mechanisms remain
unclear. An activator of the inflammasome is double-stranded RNA-dependent
protein kinase R, also termed EIF2AK2. A genetic alteration in the EIF2AK2 gene
has previously been shown to be associated with Alzheimer's disease. The present 
study genotyped samples from a Swedish cohort of patients with IBD and healthy
controls for an EIF2AK2 polymorphism. The rs2254958 polymorphism in the
5'‑untranslated region of the EIF2AK2 gene was genotyped by TaqMan® single
nucleotide polymorphism genotyping, followed by allelic discrimination. However, 
no significant association was determined between the rs2254958 polymorphism and 
the development of IBD, or clinical outcome. In conclusion, the results of the
present study suggest that the rs2254958 polymorphism has a limited effect on the
onset or progression of IBD.

AIM: To evaluate the association of known copy number variations (CNVs) in
ulcerative colitis (UC) progressing to colorectal cancer.
METHODS: Microsatellite instability analysis using the National Cancer
Institute's panel of markers, and CNV association studies using Agilent 2 × 105 k
arrays were done in tissue samples from four patient groups with UC: those at low
risk (LR) or high risk of developing colorectal cancer, those with premalignant
dysplastic lesions, and those with colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC).
DNA from tissue samples of these groups were independently hybridized on arrays
and analyzed. The data obtained were further subjected to downstream
bioinformatics enrichment analysis to examine the correlation with CAC
progression.
RESULTS: Microarray analysis highlighted a progressive increase in the total
number of CNVs [LR (n = 178) vs CAC (n = 958), 5.3-fold], gains and losses [LR (n
= 37 and 141) vs CAC (n = 495 and 463), 13.4- and 3.3-fold, respectively], size
[LR (964.2 kb) vs CAC (10540 kb), 10.9-fold] and the number of genes in such
regions [LR (n = 119) vs CAC (n = 455), 3.8-fold]. Chromosome-wise analysis of
CNVs also showed an increase in the number of CNVs across each chromosome. There 
were 38 genes common to all four groups in the study; 13 of these were common to 
cancer genes from the Genetic Disease Association dataset. The gene set
enrichment analysis and ontology analysis highlighted many cancer-associated
genes. All the samples in the different groups were microsatellite stable.
CONCLUSION: Increasing numbers of CNVs are associated with the progression of UC 
to CAC, and warrant further detailed exploration.

A critical step in the life cycle of all organisms is the duplication of the
genetic material during cell division. Ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) are
essential enzymes for this step because they control the de novo production of
the deoxyribonucleotides required for DNA synthesis and repair.
Enterobacteriaceae have three functional classes of RNRs (Ia, Ib, and III), which
are transcribed from separate operons and encoded by the genes nrdAB, nrdHIEF,
and nrdDG, respectively. Here, we investigated the role of RNRs in the virulence 
of adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) isolated from Crohn's disease (CD)
patients. Interestingly, the LF82 strain of AIEC harbors four different RNRs (two
class Ia, one class Ib, and one class III). Although the E. coli RNR enzymes have
been extensively characterized both biochemically and enzymatically, little is
known about their roles during bacterial infection. We found that RNR expression 
was modified in AIEC LF82 bacteria during cell infection, suggesting that RNRs
play an important role in AIEC virulence. Knockout of the nrdR and nrdD genes,
which encode a transcriptional regulator of RNRs and class III anaerobic RNR,
respectively, decreased AIEC LF82's ability to colonize the gut mucosa of
transgenic mice that express human CEACAM6 (carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell
adhesion molecule 6). Microarray experiments demonstrated that NrdR plays an
indirect role in AIEC virulence by interfering with bacterial motility and
chemotaxis. Thus, the development of drugs targeting RNR classes, in particular
NrdR and NrdD, could be a promising new strategy to control gut colonization by
AIEC bacteria in CD patients.

Aicardi-Goutières syndrome is an inflammatory disease occurring due to mutations 
in any of TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, RNASEH2C, SAMHD1, ADAR or IFIH1. We report
on 374 patients from 299 families with mutations in these seven genes. Most
patients conformed to one of two fairly stereotyped clinical profiles; either
exhibiting an in utero disease-onset (74 patients; 22.8% of all patients where
data were available), or a post-natal presentation, usually within the first year
of life (223 patients; 68.6%), characterized by a sub-acute encephalopathy and a 
loss of previously acquired skills. Other clinically distinct phenotypes were
also observed; particularly, bilateral striatal necrosis (13 patients; 3.6%) and 
non-syndromic spastic paraparesis (12 patients; 3.4%). We recorded 69 deaths
(19.3% of patients with follow-up data). Of 285 patients for whom data were
available, 210 (73.7%) were profoundly disabled, with no useful motor, speech and
intellectual function. Chilblains, glaucoma, hypothyroidism, cardiomyopathy,
intracerebral vasculitis, peripheral neuropathy, bowel inflammation and systemic 
lupus erythematosus were seen frequently enough to be confirmed as real
associations with the Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome phenotype. We observed a robust 
relationship between mutations in all seven genes with increased type I
interferon activity in cerebrospinal fluid and serum, and the increased
expression of interferon-stimulated gene transcripts in peripheral blood. We
recorded a positive correlation between the level of cerebrospinal fluid
interferon activity assayed within one year of disease presentation and the
degree of subsequent disability. Interferon-stimulated gene transcripts remained 
high in most patients, indicating an ongoing disease process. On the basis of
substantial morbidity and mortality, our data highlight the urgent need to define
coherent treatment strategies for the phenotypes associated with mutations in the
Aicardi-Goutières syndrome-related genes. Our findings also make it clear that a 
window of therapeutic opportunity exists relevant to the majority of affected
patients and indicate that the assessment of type I interferon activity might
serve as a useful biomarker in future clinical trials.

BACKGROUND: Although the pathogenesis of pouchitis is incompletely understood,
steroid and FK506 therapy are significantly associated with pouchitis. These
medical treatments are regulated by the FK506-binding protein (FKBP) 4 and FKBP5 
genes.
AIM: This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between pouchitis and FKBP4
and FKBP5 mRNA expression in ileal mucosa at the time of colectomy.
METHODS: Ileal mucosa specimens were collected from 71 patients who underwent
ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis. FKBP4 and FKBP5 mRNA
expression was evaluated. The relationship between mRNA expression and
clinicopathological factors, including developed pouchitis, was investigated.
RESULTS: Of these 71 patients, 25 (35.2 %) patients developed pouchitis in a mean
duration of 20.2 months (range 0-68 months). FKBP4 mRNA levels in patients who
received an immunomodulator were significantly higher than those in untreated
patients (0.167 ± 0.060 vs 0.131 ± 0.065, p = 0.009). However, FKBP5 mRNA levels 
in patients who received a three-stage operation were significantly lower than
those in the other patients (1.97 ± 1.15 vs 2.70 ± 1.12, p = 0.02). A total dose 
of prednisolone >9.4 g (HR 2.84, p = 0.02) before colectomy and FKBP5 mRNA level 
higher than the median (HR 4.49, p = 0.01) were identified as factors related to 
pouchitis.
CONCLUSIONS: FKBP5 mRNA levels in ileal mucosa at the time of colectomy are
significantly associated with pouchitis and may be a predictive factor for
developing pouchitis.

The acquired somatic JAK2-V617F mutation is present in >80% of patients with
myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Stat3 plays a role in hematopoietic
homeostasis and might influence the JAK2-V617F-driven MPN phenotype. We crossed
our transgenic SclCre;V617F mice with a conditional Stat3 knockout strain and
performed bone marrow transplantations into lethally irradiated recipient mice.
The deletion of Stat3 increased the platelet numbers in SclCre;V617F;Stat3(fl/fl)
mice compared with SclCre;V617F;Stat3(fl/+) or SclCre;V617F;Stat3(+/+) mice.
Stat3 deletion also normalized JAK2-V617F-induced neutrophilia. Megakaryocyte
progenitors were elevated, especially in the spleen, and a slight increase in
myelofibrosis was noted. We observed increased mRNA expression levels of Stat1
and Stat1 target genes and augmented phosphorylation of Stat1 protein in bone
marrow and spleen of JAK2-V617F mice after Stat3 deletion. The survival of
Stat3-deficient mice expressing JAK2-V617F was reduced. Inflammatory bowel
disease, previously associated with shortened survival of Stat3-deficient mice,
was less prominent in the bone marrow transplantation setting, possibly by
limiting deletion of Stat3 to hematopoietic tissues only. In conclusion, deletion
of Stat3 in hematopoietic cells from JAK2-V617F mice did not ameliorate the
course of MPN, but rather enhanced thrombocytosis and shortened the overall
survival.

BACKGROUND: Human genetics and host-associated microbial communities have been
associated independently with a wide range of chronic diseases. One of the
strongest associations in each case is inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but
disease risk cannot be explained fully by either factor individually. Recent
findings point to interactions between host genetics and microbial exposures as
important contributors to disease risk in IBD. These include evidence of the
partial heritability of the gut microbiota and the conferral of gut mucosal
inflammation by microbiome transplant even when the dysbiosis was initially
genetically derived. Although there have been several tests for association of
individual genetic loci with bacterial taxa, there has been no direct comparison 
of complex genome-microbiome associations in large cohorts of patients with an
immunity-related disease.
METHODS: We obtained 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences from intestinal
biopsies as well as host genotype via Immunochip in three independent cohorts
totaling 474 individuals. We tested for correlation between relative abundance of
bacterial taxa and number of minor alleles at known IBD risk loci, including fine
mapping of multiple risk alleles in the Nucleotide-binding oligomerization
domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) gene exon. We identified host polymorphisms
whose associations with bacterial taxa were conserved across two or more cohorts,
and we tested related genes for enrichment of host functional pathways.
RESULTS: We identified and confirmed in two cohorts a significant association
between NOD2 risk allele count and increased relative abundance of
Enterobacteriaceae, with directionality of the effect conserved in the third
cohort. Forty-eight additional IBD-related SNPs have directionality of their
associations with bacterial taxa significantly conserved across two or three
cohorts, implicating genes enriched for regulation of innate immune response, the
JAK-STAT cascade, and other immunity-related pathways.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest complex interactions between genetically
altered host functional pathways and the structure of the microbiome. Our
findings demonstrate the ability to uncover novel associations from paired
genome-microbiome data, and they suggest a complex link between host genetics and
microbial dysbiosis in subjects with IBD across independent cohorts.

Recognition of microbial nucleic acid initiates host immune defenses against
pathogens. Impaired recognition of nucleic acid is involved in the pathogenesis
of inflammatory bowel diseases. In contrast to the relatively well-established
mechanism of microbial RNA sensing and associated signaling cascades, very little
is known on how microbial DNA activates intracellular DNA sensors and controls
the function of antigen-presenting cells (especially dendritic cells) to shape
mucosal immune responses in intestine. In this review, we will introduce mucosal 
dendritic cell population, describe various putative DNA sensors, emphasize on
newly identified cGAS-cGAMP-STING complex, and discuss how the detection of
foreign DNA by mucosal dendritic cells activates innate and adaptive immune
responses in intestine. Finally, we will identify certain inflammatory bowel
disease-susceptibility genes that associate with impaired microbial DNA
recognition in human.

AIM: To analyze the cellular immune response towards microsatellite-instability
(MSI)-induced frameshift-peptides (FSPs) in patients suffering from inflammatory 
bowel disease (IBD) with and without thiopurine-based immunosuppressive
treatment.
METHODS: Frequencies of peripheral blood T cell responses of IBD patients (n =
75) against FSPs derived from 14 microsatellite-containing candidate genes were
quantified by interferon-γ enzyme-linked immunospot. T cells derived from 20
healthy individuals served as controls.
RESULTS: Significant T cell reactivities against MSI-induced FSPs were observed
in 59 of 75 IBD patients (78.7%). This was significantly more as we could observe
in 20 healthy controls (P = 0.001). Overall, the reactivity was significantly
influenced by thiopurine treatment (P = 0.032) and duration of disease (P =
0.002) but not by duration or cumulative amount of thiopurine therapy (P =
0.476). Unexpected, 15 of 24 (62.5%) IBD patients without prior thiopurine
treatment also showed increased FSP-specific immune responses (P = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: These findings propose FSPs as potential novel class of
inflammation-associated antigens and this in turn may have implications for
screening, diagnosis as well as clinical management of patients suffering from
IBD and other inflammatory conditions.

Giardia duodenalis is the most common cause of parasitic diarrhea worldwide and a
well-established risk factor for postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome. We
hypothesized that Giardia-induced disruptions in host-microbiota interactions may
play a role in the pathogenesis of giardiasis and in postgiardiasis disease.
Functional changes induced by Giardia in commensal bacteria and the resulting
effects on Caenorhabditis elegans were determined. Although Giardia or bacteria
alone did not affect worm viability, combining commensal Escherichia coli
bacteria with Giardia became lethal to C. elegans. Giardia also induced killing
of C. elegans with attenuated Citrobacter rodentium espF and map mutant strains, 
human microbiota from a healthy donor, and microbiota from inflamed colonic sites
of ulcerative colitis patient. In contrast, combinations of Giardia with
microbiota from noninflamed sites of the same patient allowed for worm survival. 
The synergistic lethal effects of Giardia and E. coli required the presence of
live bacteria and were associated with the facilitation of bacterial colonization
in the C. elegans intestine. Exposure to C. elegans and/or Giardia altered the
expression of 172 genes in E. coli. The genes affected by Giardia included
hydrogen sulfide biosynthesis (HSB) genes, and deletion of a positive regulator
of HSB genes, cysB, was sufficient to kill C. elegans even in the absence of
Giardia. Our findings indicate that Giardia induces functional changes in
commensal bacteria, possibly making them opportunistic pathogens, and alters
host-microbe homeostatic interactions. This report describes the use of a novel
in vivo model to assess the toxicity of human microbiota.

BACKGROUND: Many genetic risk loci have been identified for inflammatory bowel
disease and colorectal cancer; however, identifying the causal genes for each
association signal remains a challenge. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL)
studies have identified common variants that induce differential gene expression 
and eQTLs can be cross-referenced with disease association signals for gene
prioritization. However, the genetics of gene expression are highly
tissue-specific, and further eQTL datasets from primary tissues are needed.
METHODS: We have conducted an eQTL discovery study using tissue extracted
endoscopically from the terminal ileum and 4 colonic locations of non-inflamed
bowel from 65 controls and patients with quiescent inflammatory bowel disease. A 
genome-wide cis-eQTL analysis was performed on >3,600,000 variants and 13,558
expressed probes.
RESULTS: We identified 1312 independent eQTLs associated with the differential
expression of 1222 genes in rectal mucosa. One hundred seventy-one, 211, 168, and
102 independent eQTLs were identified in the sigmoid, descending colon, ascending
colon, and terminal ileum, respectively. Twenty-six percent of genes with rectal 
eQTLs were novel and unique compared with 7 published eQTL datasets. Rectal eQTLs
were significantly enriched for genes expressed in the colon. Examining 163
inflammatory bowel disease risk loci identified 11 tag single-nucleotide
polymorphisms that were rectal eQTLs. A colorectal cancer locus at 11q23
contained a rectal eQTL for COLCA2, a protein implicated in colon cancer
pathogenesis.
CONCLUSIONS: This study defines a catalog of ileal and colonic eQTLs. Our data
reaffirm the tissue specificity of eQTLs and support the notion that
identification of functional variants in relevant tissue can be effective in
fine-mapping genetic risk loci.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of (-2578C/A) and (+936C/T) single
nucleotide polymorphism(SNPs) of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene
with the susceptibility to ulcerative colitis (UC).
METHODS: A total of 373 UC patients and 503 healthy controls were recruited. The 
(-2578C/A) and (+936C/T) polymorphism of VEGF gene were detected using a
mini-sequencing technique.
RESULTS: By an unconditional logistic regression analysis, the frequencies of the
mutant allele T and genotype CT+TT of VEGF gene (+936C/T) were significantly
decreased in patients with severe UC compared to the controls (10.4% vs 19.3%, OR
= 0.487, 95%CI 0.248-0.954, P = 0.036; 18.8% vs 33.8%, OR = 0.452, 95%CI
0.214-0.955, P = 0.037, respectively). Moreover, patients with severe UC had
significant lower rates of mutant allele T and genotype CT+TT compared with
patients with mild and moderate UC (10.4% vs 20.5%, OR = 0.452, 95%CI
0.229-0.894, P = 0.022; 18.8% vs 36.9%, OR = 0.394, 95%CI 0.185-0.842, P = 0.016,
respectively). The frequencies of mutant allele A and genotype CA+AA of VEGF
(-2578C/A) gene were not statistically different between UC patients and the
controls. Moreover, they were not significantly associated with the
clinicopathologic features in UC patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The mutation of VEGF (+936C/T) gene is correlated with the severity 
of UC. However, the polymorphism of VEGF (-2578C/A) gene is not significantly
related to the susceptibility to UC.

Recent scientific results underline the importance of the intestinal microbiome, 
the totality of all intestinal microbes and their genes, for the health of the
host organism. The intestinal microbiome can therefore be considered as a kind of
"external organ". It has been shown that the intestinal microbiota is a complex
and dynamic ecosystem that influences host immunity and metabolism beyond the
intestine. The composition and functionality of the intestinal microbiota is of
major importance for the development and maintenance of intestinal functions.
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are characterized by dysregulated interactions 
between the host and its microbiota.The present contribution summarizes current
knowledge of the composition and development of the intestinal microbiome and
gives an overview of the bidirectional interaction between host and microbiota.
The contribution informs about insights regarding the role of the intestinal
microbiota in IBD and finally discusses the protective potential of microbial
therapies in the context of IBD.

Macrophages activated by the TLR4 agonist LPS undergo dramatic changes in their
metabolic activity. We here show that LPS induces expression of the key metabolic
regulator Pyruvate Kinase M2 (PKM2). Activation of PKM2 using two
well-characterized small molecules, DASA-58 and TEPP-46, inhibited LPS-induced
Hif-1α and IL-1β, as well as the expression of a range of other Hif-1α-dependent 
genes. Activation of PKM2 attenuated an LPS-induced proinflammatory M1 macrophage
phenotype while promoting traits typical of an M2 macrophage. We show that
LPS-induced PKM2 enters into a complex with Hif-1α, which can directly bind to
the IL-1β promoter, an event that is inhibited by activation of PKM2. Both
compounds inhibited LPS-induced glycolytic reprogramming and succinate
production. Finally, activation of PKM2 by TEPP-46 in vivo inhibited LPS and
Salmonella typhimurium-induced IL-1β production, while boosting production of
IL-10. PKM2 is therefore a critical determinant of macrophage activation by LPS, 
promoting the inflammatory response.

OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to investigate the association between the interferon 
regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) gene polymorphisms and the onset of Crohn's disease
(CD) in a Malaysian cohort.
METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples collected from 91 CD
patients and 100 healthy individuals via a conventional phenol-chloroform
extraction method. Screening of the four target single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs), including rs3807306, rs4728142, rs10954213 and rs11770589 was carried out
in a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) thermal cycler using TaqMan
genotyping assay. The genetic data obtained was subsequently subjected to
statistical analysis to relate the SNPs to the onset of CD in the Malaysian
population. The genotyping assay and data were further validated selectively by
conventional PCR amplification of the SNP sites and DNA sequencing.
RESULTS: The rs3807306 G allele was a risk factor for CD (OR 2.3630, P =
0.00004), whereas the homozygous T genotype was protective against the disease
(OR 0.2038, P = 0.00004). The heterozygous A/G genotype of rs10954213 was
significantly associated with CD (OR 4.319, P = 0.0377). On the other hand, the
homozygous A and heterozygous A/G genotypes of the rs11770589 were significant in
the controls (OR 0.4242, P = 0.0166) and patients (OR 2.000, P = 0.0179),
respectively. In the ethnic-stratification analysis, the rs11770589 homozygous A 
genotype was protective in Indians (OR 0.1551, P = 0.0112).
CONCLUSION: IRF5 gene polymorphisms may play a role in the development of CD in
the Malaysian population.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether caspase recruitment
domain-containing protein 8 (CARD8) rs2043211 polymorphism was associated with
susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
METHODS: Relevant studies were searched using PubMed and Embase up to February
2014. A meta-analysis was conducted on the association between rs2043211
polymorphism and IBD using: (1) allele contrast, (2) the dominant model, (3) the 
recessive model, and (4) homozygote contrast. The pooled estimated of risk was
obtained by random-effects model or fixed-effects model. Publication bias was
assessed by Egger's test.
RESULTS: Eight relevant articles with a total of 10 534 IBD patients [6785
Crohn's disease (CD), 3713 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 36 indeterminate colitis
(IC)] and 6755 healthy controls were included in the meta-analysis, which
consisted of 12 studies, 12 for CD, 10 for UC, 2 for IC. There was no significant
association between rs2043211 polymorphism and IBD, CD, and IC in overall
population. However, stratified meta-analysis by ethnicity showed significant
association between rs2043211 polymorphism and CD in the European population
under the dominant model [odds ratio (OR) = 1.210, 95% confidence interval
(CI) = 1.013-1.445, p = 0.036] and homozygote contrast (OR = 1.212, 95%
CI = 1.005-1.461, p = 0.044).
CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis results indicated significant association between 
rs2043211 polymorphism and the susceptibility to CD under the dominant model and 
homozygote contrast in the European population.

Genome-wide association studies of the related chronic inflammatory bowel
diseases (IBD) known as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis have shown strong 
evidence of association to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). This
region encodes a large number of immunological candidates, including the
antigen-presenting classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules. Studies in 
IBD have indicated that multiple independent associations exist at HLA and
non-HLA genes, but they have lacked the statistical power to define the
architecture of association and causal alleles. To address this, we performed
high-density SNP typing of the MHC in >32,000 individuals with IBD, implicating
multiple HLA alleles, with a primary role for HLA-DRB1*01:03 in both Crohn's
disease and ulcerative colitis. Noteworthy differences were observed between
these diseases, including a predominant role for class II HLA variants and
heterozygous advantage observed in ulcerative colitis, suggesting an important
role of the adaptive immune response in the colonic environment in the
pathogenesis of IBD.

Farnesoid x receptor in human metabolism and disease: the interplay between gene 
polymorphisms, clinical phenotypes and disease susceptibility.

INTRODUCTION: Farnesoid x receptor (FXR) belongs to the group of nuclear
receptors (NRs), which regulate the expression of various genes by binding to DNA
either as a monomer or a heterodimer with retinoid x receptor.
AREAS COVERED: FXR affects several metabolic pathways through its specific target
genes, regulating bile acid (BA) synthesis and homeostasis, glucose and lipid
metabolism, also exhibiting a crucial role in intestinal bacterial growth and
liver regeneration. Additionally, FXR is involved in the pathogenesis of
different cholestatic diseases, as well as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease,
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and primary idiopathic BA malabsorption.
EXPERT OPINION: Analyses of certain FXR polymorphisms revealed associations with 
clinical phenotypes and susceptibility to various human diseases. FXR
single-nucleotide polymorphisms seem to be correlated with differences in glucose
homeostasis, gallstone formation, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, IBD and 
therapeutic response to hypolipidemic therapy, among studied populations.
Unfortunately, little data are still available and more studies remain to be done
to determine the contribution of FXR polymorphisms in estimating risk factors and
clinical outcomes for several diseases.

During a course of colitis, production of the gaseous mediator hydrogen sulfide
(H2S) is markedly up-regulated at sites of mucosal damage and contributes
significantly to healing and resolution of inflammation. The signaling mechanisms
through which H2S promotes resolution of colitis are unknown. We hypothesized
that the beneficial effects of H2S in experimental colitis are mediated via
stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α. The hapten dinitrobenzene
sulfonic acid was used to induce colitis in rats and mice. This resulted in an
elevated expression of the H2S-producing enzyme, cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE), and
HIF-1α at sites of mucosal ulceration, and the expression of these 2 enzymes
followed a similar pattern throughout the course of colitis. This represented a
functionally important relationship because the loss of CSE-derived H2S
production led to decreased HIF-1α stabilization and exacerbation of colitis.
Furthermore, application of an H2S-releasing molecule, diallyl disulfide (DADS), 
stabilized colonic HIF-1α expression, up-regulated hypoxia-responsive genes, and 
reduced the severity of disease during peak inflammation. Importantly, the
ability of DADS to promote the resolution of colitis was abolished when
coadministered with an inhibitor of HIF-1α in vivo (PX-478). DADS was also able
to maintain HIF-1α expression at a later point in colitis, when HIF-1α levels
would have normally returned to control levels, and to enhance resolution.
Finally, we found that HIF-1α stabilization inhibited colonic H2S production and 
may represent a negative feedback mechanism to prevent prolonged HIF-1α
stabilization. Our findings demonstrate an important link between H2S and HIF-1α 
in the resolution of inflammation and injury during colitis and provide
mechanistic insights into the therapeutic value of H2S donors.

The annual incidence of the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) ulcerative colitis
and Crohn's disease has increased at an alarming rate. Although the specific
pathophysiology underlying IBD continues to be elusive, it is hypothesized that
IBD results from an aberrant and persistent immune response directed against
microbes or their products in the gut, facilitated by the genetic susceptibility 
of the host and intrinsic alterations in mucosal barrier function. In this
review, we will describe advances in the understanding of how the interaction of 
host genetics and the intestinal microbiome contribute to the pathogenesis of
IBD, with a focus on bacterial metabolites such as short chain fatty acids
(SCFAs) as possible key signaling molecules.  In particular, we will describe
alterations of the intestinal microbiota in IBD, focusing on how genetic loci
affect the gut microbial phylogenetic distribution and the production of their
major microbial metabolic product, SCFAs. We then describe how enteroendocrine
cells and myenteric nerves express SCFA receptors that integrate networks such as
the cholinergic and serotonergic neural systems and the glucagon-like peptide
hormonal pathway, to modulate gut inflammation, permeability, and growth as part 
of an integrated model of IBD pathogenesis.  Through this integrative approach,
we hope that novel hypotheses will emerge that will be tested in reductionist,
hypothesis-driven studies in order to examine the interrelationship of these
systems in the hope of better understanding IBD pathogenesis and to inform novel 
therapies.

BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is associated with differential colonic
expression of genes involved in immune response (e.g. IL8) and barrier integrity 
(e.g. cadherins). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are regulators of gene expression and are
involved in various immune-related diseases. In this study, we investigated (1)
if miRNA expression in UC mucosa is altered and (2) if any of these changes
correlate with mucosal mRNA expression. Integration of mRNA and miRNA expression 
profiling may allow the identification of functional links between dysregulated
miRNAs and their target mRNA.
METHODOLOGY: Colonic mucosal biopsies were obtained from 17 UC (10 active and 7
inactive) patients and 10 normal controls. Total RNA was used to analyze miRNA
and mRNA expression via Affymetrix miRNA 2.0 and Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0ST
arrays, respectively. Both miRNA and gene expression profiles were integrated by 
correlation analysis to identify dysregulated miRNAs with their corresponding
predicted target mRNA. Microarray data were validated with qRT-PCR. Regulation of
IL8 and CDH11 expression by hsa-miR-200c-3p was determined by luciferase reporter
assays.
RESULTS: When comparing active UC patients vs. controls, 51 miRNAs and 1543 gene 
probe sets gave significantly different signals. In contrast, in inactive UC vs. 
controls, no significant miRNA expression differences were found while 155 gene
probe sets had significantly different signals. We then identified potential
target genes of the significantly dysregulated miRNAs and genes in active UC vs. 
controls and found a highly significant inverse correlation between
hsa-miR-200c-3p and IL8, an inflammatory marker, and between hsa-miR-200c-3p and 
CDH11, a gene related to intestinal epithelial barrier function. We could
demonstrate that hsa-miR-200c-3p directly regulates IL8 and CDH11 expression.
CONCLUSION: Differential expression of immune- and barrier-related genes in
inflamed UC mucosa may be influenced by altered expression of miRNAs. Integrated 
analysis of miRNA and mRNA expression profiles revealed hsa-miR-200c-3p for use
of miRNA mimics as therapeutics.

BACKGROUND: The ability to measure the expression of proinflammatory cytokines
from intestinal biopsies in patients with Crohn's disease in an accurate and
reproducible way is critical for proof-of-concept and mechanism-of-action trials;
however, the number of biopsies from a segment of the ileum or colon required to 
yield reproducible results has not been rigorously evaluated. We examined
intestinal biopsies from patients with Crohn's disease to validate methods for
detecting changes in inflammatory gene expression.
METHODS: To evaluate the reproducibility of gene expression measurements,
intestinal biopsies were obtained from designated segments from 6 healthy
controls, 6 patients with active Crohn's disease, and 6 patients with inactive
Crohn's disease. Disease activity was based on the simple endoscopic score for
Crohn's disease. Expression of 7 proinflammatory genes was measured from each
biopsy using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Using a linear mixed effects
model, the power to detect transcriptional changes corresponding to active and
inactive Crohn's disease was calculated.
RESULTS: Total simple endoscopic score for Crohn's disease score corresponds with
expression of most inflammatory biomarkers. For most genes, 2 to 5 biopsies are
needed to reduce sampling error to <25% for most genes. To measure changes in
mRNA expression corresponding to active versus inactive Crohn's disease, 1 to 2
intestinal biopsies from 3 patients before and after treatment are needed to
yield power of at least 80%.
CONCLUSIONS: Measuring proinflammatory gene expression from mucosal biopsies from
patients with Crohn's disease is practicable and provides objective biomarkers
that can be used in proof-of-concept and mechanism-of-action trials to assess
response to therapy.

BACKGROUND: Pharmacological induction of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), a global
transcriptional regulator of the hypoxic response, by prolyl hydroxylase
inhibitors (PHDi) is protective in murine models of colitis, and epithelial cells
are critical for the observed therapeutic efficacy. Because systemic HIF
activation may lead to potentially negative off-target effects, we hypothesized
that targeting epithelial HIF through oral delivery of PHDi would be sufficient
to protect against colitis in a mouse model.
METHODS: Using a chemically induced trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid murine model of
colitis, we compared the efficacy of oral and intraperitoneal (i.p.) delivery of 
the PHDi; AKB-4924 in preventing colitis, as measured by endoscopy, histology,
barrier integrity, and immune profiling. Furthermore, we measured potential
off-target effects, examining HIF and HIF target genes in the heart and kidney,
as well as erythropoietin and hematocrit levels.
RESULTS: Oral administration of AKB-4924 exhibited mucosal protection comparable 
i.p. dosing. Oral delivery of PHDi led to reduced colonic epithelial HIF
stabilization compared with i.p. delivery, but this was still sufficient to
induce transcription of downstream HIF targets. Furthermore, oral delivery of
PHDi led to reduced stabilization of HIF and activation of HIF targets in
extraintestinal organs.
CONCLUSIONS: Oral delivery of PHDi therapies to this intestinal mucosa protects
against colitis in animal models and represents a potential therapeutic strategy 
for inflammatory bowel disease, which also precludes unwanted extraintestinal
effects.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a complex immunological disorder
characterized by chronic inflammation caused mainly by unknown factors. The
interleukin-10 knockout (IL-10 KO) mouse is a well-established murine model of
IBD which develops spontaneous intestinal inflammation that resembles Crohn's
disease. In the present study, human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells
(hAMSCs) were administrated to IL-10 KO mice to evaluate the anti-inflammatory
effects of hAMSCs that may attenuate the progress of or treat IBD. After IBD was 
induced by feeding the IL-10 KO mouse a 125-250 ppm piroxicam mixed diet for 1
week, 2×10(6) hAMSCs were injected into the peritoneum and the mice were switched
to a normal diet. After 1 week, the mice were sacrificed and tissue samples were 
harvested. Tissue scores for inflammation and inflammation-related genes
expression were determined. The hAMSC-treated group showed significantly reduced 
inflammatory changes in histological analysis. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis
showed that RANTES, Toll-like receptor 9, and IL-4 expression levels were not
significantly different between the groups while IL-12, INF-γ, and TNF-α levels
were significantly decreased in the hAMSC treated group. hAMSC attenuated IBD in 
the IL-10 KO mice by suppressing inflammatory cytokine expression, was mediated
by the type 1 helper T cell pathway. Even though only a single injection of
hAMSCs was delivered, the effect influenced chronic events associated with
inflammatory changes and demonstrated that hAMSCs are a powerful candidate for
IBD therapy.

BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the
gastrointestinal tract. Genetic polymorphisms can confer CD risk and influence
disease phenotype. Indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase-1 (IDO1) is one of the most
over-expressed genes in CD and mediates potent anti-inflammatory effects via
tryptophan metabolism along the kynurenine pathway. We aimed to determine whether
non-synonymous polymorphisms in IDO1 or IDO2 (a gene paralog) are important
either as CD risk alleles or as modifiers of CD phenotype.
METHODS: Utilizing a prospectively collected database, clinically phenotyped CD
patients (n = 734) and non-IBD controls (n = 354) were genotyped for established 
IDO1 and IDO2 non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and novel
genetic variants elucidated in the literature. Allelic frequencies between CD and
non-IBD controls were compared. Genotype-phenotype analysis was conducted. IDO1
enzyme activity was assessed by calculating the serum kynurenine to tryptophan
ratio (K/T).
RESULTS: IDO1 SNPs were rare (1.7% non-IBD vs 1.1% CD; p = NS) and not linked to 
Crohn's disease diagnosis in this population. IDO1 SNPs did however associate
with a severe clinical course, presence of perianal disease, extraintestinal
manifestations and a reduced serum K/T ratio during active disease suggesting
lower IDO1 function. IDO2 minor allele variants were common and one of them,
rs45003083, associated with reduced risk of Crohn's disease (p = 0.025). No IDO2 
SNPs associated with a particular Crohn's disease clinical phenotype.
CONCLUSIONS: This work highlights the functional importance of IDO enzymes in
human Crohn's disease and establishes relative rates of IDO genetic variants in a
US population.

BACKGROUND: Serotonin (5-HT) release and serotonin reuptake transporter (5-HTT)
expression have been reported to be decreased in experimental colitis, in
interleukin-10 knockout-associated colitis, and in patients with ulcerative
colitis. Serotonin is known to play an important role in the pathogenesis of
colitis, but individual genetic variants of 5-HTT gene in microscopic colitis and
ulcerative colitis are not known.
AIM: This study aimed to evaluate the association between the serotonin
transporter gene promoter polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) and 5-HT concentration in
microscopic colitis (MC) and ulcerative colitis (UC) patients.
METHOD: This prospective case-control study included 41 patients with microscopic
colitis (age 19-82 years, mean 35 ± 13.6), 75 patients with ulcerative colitis
(age 16-65 years, mean 38.5 ± 11.6), and 100 controls (age 20-64 years, mean 38 ±
11). 5-HTTLPR gene polymorphism was studied by polymerase chain reaction-based
assay. 5-HT levels were measured by ELISA.
RESULTS: The frequency of the 5-HTTLPR (SS) genotype was significantly lower in
MC (12 %) patients compared to controls (30 %) (p < 0.05). When the L/L and L/S
genotypes were combined into one group, the frequencies of the non-S genotype
were significantly higher than those of S/S genotype between the MC patients and 
the controls (p < 0.05). 5-HT levels were significantly higher in UC and MC
patients compared to healthy controls (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: A significant association was observed between LL genotype of
5-HTTLPR polymorphism and microscopic colitis, suggesting that 5-HTTLPR is a
potential candidate gene involved in the pathogenesis of microscopic colitis.
Serotonin levels were significantly higher in microscopic colitis and ulcerative 
colitis patients compared to healthy controls.

Idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a common cause of chronic
gastrointestinal (GI) disease in dogs. The combination of an underlying host
genetic susceptibility, an intestinal dysbiosis, and dietary/environmental
factors are suspected as main contributing factors in the pathogenesis of canine 
IBD. However, actual mechanisms of the host-microbe interactions remain elusive. 
The aim of this study was to compare the fecal microbiota and serum metabolite
profiles between healthy dogs (n = 10) and dogs with IBD before and after 3 weeks
of medical therapy (n = 12). Fecal microbiota and metabolite profiles were
characterized by 454-pyrosequencing of 16 S rRNA genes and by an untargeted
metabolomics approach, respectively. Significantly lower bacterial diversity and 
distinct microbial communities were observed in dogs with IBD compared to the
healthy control dogs. While Gammaproteobacteria were overrepresented,
Erysipelotrichia, Clostridia, and Bacteroidia were underrepresented in dogs with 
IBD. The functional gene content was predicted from the 16 S rRNA gene data using
PICRUSt, and revealed overrepresented bacterial secretion system and
transcription factors, and underrepresented amino acid metabolism in dogs with
IBD. The serum metabolites 3-hydroxybutyrate, hexuronic acid, ribose, and
gluconic acid lactone were significantly more abundant in dogs with IBD. Although
a clinical improvement was observed after medical therapy in all dogs with IBD,
this was not accompanied by significant changes in the fecal microbiota or in
serum metabolite profiles. These results suggest the presence of oxidative stress
and a functional alteration of the GI microbiota in dogs with IBD, which
persisted even in the face of a clinical response to medical therapy.

The contribution of epigenetic alterations to disease pathogenesis is emerging as
a research priority. In this study, we aimed to seek DNA methylation changes in
peripheral blood and tissue biopsies from patients with inflammatory bowel
disease. The promoter methylation status of genes involved in inflammation and
autoimmunity was profiled using the Human Inflammatory Response and Autoimmunity 
EpiTect Methyl II Signature PCR Array profiles. Methylation was considered to be 
hypermethylated if >20% according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The
microarrays were validated with Quantitative Real-time PCR. Regarding Crohn
disease (CD) no gene appeared hypermethylated compared to healthy controls. In
ulcerative colitis (UC) 5 genes (CXCL14, CXCL5, GATA3, IL17C, and IL4R) were
hypermethylated compared to healthy controls. Some of the examined genes show
different methylation patterns between CD and UC. Concerning tissue samples we
found that all hypermethylated genes appear the same methylation pattern and
confirmed a moderate-strong correlation between methylation levels in colon
biopsies and peripheral blood (Pearson coefficients r=0.089-0.779, and
r=0.023-0.353, respectively). The epigenetic changes observed in this study
indicate that CD and UC exhibit specific DNA methylation signatures with
potential clinical applications in IBD non-invasive diagnosis and prognosis.

Contentious host-microbiota relationship in inflammatory bowel disease--can foes 
become friends again?

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic debilitating disorders of unknown 
etiology, consisting of two main conditions, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's
disease. Major advances have recently taken place in human genetic studies of IBD
and over 160 risk loci for these two diseases have been uncovered. These genetic 
data highlight a key role for genes that code for immunological and epithelial
barrier functions. Environmental factors also make substantial contributions to
the pathogenesis of IBD and account for the growing incidence of the diseases
around the world. Intestinal microbiota creates resistance to infection, provides
nutrients, and educates the immune system and in many ways has a significant
impact on human health. Aberrant microbiota composition and decreased diversity
(dysbiotic microbiota) are key etiopathological events in IBD. Dysbiotic
microbiota can lead to loss of normal, regulatory immune effects in the gut
mucosa. This may play a central role in the development and perpetuation of
chronic inflammation. Further, the expression of specific innate immune receptors
that recognize microbes is altered in the IBD epithelium. Therefore, the
combination of host side epithelial barrier functions and the presence of
dysbiotic microbiota in the gut together promote inflammation. New therapeutic
options targeting microbiota are currently considered for IBD and they may, in
the future, provide means to reverse the pathogenic host-microbiota relationship 
into a symbiotic one. In this review, the focus is on the intestinal microbiota
and host-microbe interactions in IBD.

The innate immune system and inflammatory bowel disease.

The innate immune system is a key factor in understanding the pathogenesis of
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and in the hopes of improving its treatment.
NOD2, a pattern recognition receptor, was one of the first major susceptibility
genes identified in Crohn's disease (CD). This discovery has been followed by
genome-wide association studies that have identified other genes involved in
innate immune responses. Most notably, polymorphisms in the interleukin (IL)-23
receptor have also been linked to IBD - both CD and ulcerative colitis. At the
core of the innate immune defects associated with IBD is a lack of generating a
robust response to control invasive commensal or pathogenic bacteria. The defect 
sometimes lies in a failure of the epithelium to express antimicrobial peptides
or in defective control of intracellular bacteria by phagocytic cells such as
dendritic cells, macrophages, or neutrophils. The recent identification of innate
lymphoid cells that express the IL-23 receptor and generate both proinflammatory 
and protective or regulatory responses to commensal or pathogenic bacteria
provides another layer of complexity to the interplay of host protection and
dysregulated inflammation. Although inhibition of tumor necrosis factor has been 
highly successful as a strategy in treating IBD, we must better understand the
nuanced role of other innate cytokines before we may incorporate these in the
treatment of IBD.

The two major subtypes of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ulcerative colitis
(UC, MIM#191390) and Crohn's disease (CD, MIM#266600), are chronic
relapsing-remitting inflammatory disorders affecting primarily the
gastrointestinal tract. Prevalence rates in North America and Europe range from
21 to 246 per 100,000 for UC and 8 to 214 per 100,000 for CD. Although CD and UC 
share some clinical and pathological features, they can be distinguished by
localization, endoscopic appearance, histology and behavior, which suggest
differences in the underlying pathophysiology. The importance of genetic risk
factors in disease etiology is high and has been documented more clearly for CD
than for UC (relative sibling risks λ(s): 15-35 for CD, 6-9 for UC). The most
recent and largest genetic association study for IBD, which employed genome-wide 
association data for over 75,000 patients and controls, established the
association of 163 susceptibility loci with IBD. Although the disease variance
explained by the 163 loci only amounts to 13.6% for CD and 7.5% for UC, the
identified loci and the candidate genes within yielded valuable insights into the
pathogenesis of IBD and the relevant disease pathways. We here review the current
research on the genetics of IBD and provide insights into on current efforts as
well as suggest topics for future research.

Pharmacogenetic studies have been performed for almost all classes of drugs that 
have been used in IBD but very few have generated consistent findings or have
been replicated. The genetic test that has been approved for clinical practice is
TPMT testing prior to starting treatment with thiopurine drugs. Research in IBD
pharmacogenetics has focused on prediction of drug efficacy and toxicity by
identifying polymorphisms in the genes encoding enzymes that are involved in
metabolic pathways. Recent research has mainly focused on therapeutic agents such
as azathioprine, methotrexate, aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, infliximab and 
adalimumab. Future pharmaceutical trials should include pharmacogenetic research 
to test appropriate candidate genes in a prospective manner and correlate genetic
associations with trial outcomes and relevant functional data.

genes in the gut microbiome of inflammatory bowel disease and type 2 diabetic
patients. We used publicly available metagenomic datasets from the Human
Microbiome Project and the MetaHIT consortium, and determined the abundance of
bile salt hydrolase gene (bsh), 7 alpha-dehydroxylase gene (adh) and 7-alpha
hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase gene (hsdh) in fecal bacteria in diseased
populations of Crohn's disease (CD), Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM). Phylum level abundance analysis showed a significant reduction
in Firmicute-derived bsh in UC and T2DM patients but not in CD patients, relative
to healthy controls. Reduction of adh and hsdh genes was also seen in UC and T2DM
patients, while an increase was observed in the CD population as compared to
healthy controls. A further analysis of the bsh genes showed significant
differences in the correlations of certain Firmicutes families with disease or
healthy populations. From this observation we proceeded to analyse BSH protein
sequences and identified BSH proteins clusters representing the most abundant
strains in our analysis of Firmicute bsh genes. The abundance of the bsh genes
corresponding to one of these protein clusters was significantly reduced in all
disease states relative to healthy controls. This cluster includes bsh genes
derived from Lachospiraceae, Clostridiaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae and
Ruminococcaceae families. This metagenomic analysis provides evidence of the
importance of bile acid modifying enzymes in health and disease. It further
highlights the importance of identifying gene and protein clusters, as the same
gene may be associated with health or disease, depending on the strains
expressing the enzyme, and differences in the enzymes themselves.

The association of pyoderma gangrenosum, acne, and suppurative hidradenitis
(PASH) has recently been described and suggested to be a new entity within the
spectrum of autoinflammatory syndromes, which are characterized by recurrent
episodes of sterile inflammation, without circulating autoantibodies and
autoreactive T-cells. We conducted an observational study on 5 patients with PASH
syndrome, analyzing their clinical features, genetic profile of 10 genes already 
known to be involved in autoinflammatory diseases (AIDs), and cytokine expression
pattern both in lesional skin and serum. In tissue skin samples, the expressions 
of interleukin (IL)-1β and its receptors I and II were significantly higher in
PASH (P = 0.028, 0.047, and 0.050, respectively) than in controls. In PASH
patients, chemokines such as IL-8 (P = 0.004), C-X-C motif ligand (CXCL) 1/2/3 (P
= 0.028), CXCL 16 (P = 0.008), and regulated on activation, normal T cell
expressed and secreted (RANTES) (P = 0.005) were overexpressed. Fas/Fas ligand
and cluster of differentiation (CD)40/CD40 ligand systems were also overexpressed
(P = 0.016 for Fas, P = 0.006 for Fas ligand, P = 0.005 for CD40, and P = 0.004
for CD40 ligand), contributing to tissue damage and inflammation. In peripheral
blood, serum levels of the main proinflammatory cytokines, that is, IL-1β, tumor 
necrosis factor-α, and IL-17, were within the normal range, suggesting that in
PASH syndrome, the inflammatory process is mainly localized into the skin. Four
out of our 5 PASH patients presented genetic alterations typical of well-known
AIDs, including inflammatory bowel diseases, and the only patient lacking genetic
changes had clinically evident Crohn disease. In conclusion, overexpression of
cytokines/chemokines and molecules amplifying the inflammatory network, along
with the genetic changes, supports the view that PASH syndrome is
autoinflammatory in origin.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an idiopathic disease thought to be caused by
a dysregulated immune response to host intestinal microflora. The role of genetic
factors is indicated by familial clustering of cases and higher incidence in
monozygotic twins. An interaction between genetic and environmental factors is
thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of these disorders. Changes in diet,
antibiotic use and intestinal colonization have likely contributed to increased
prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease in the past century. Environmental
factors or infections are thought to alter the barrier function of the
epithelium, leading to loss of immune tolerance to intestinal antigens. This loss
of tolerance activates dendritic cells, triggering their transport to mesenteric 
lymph nodes, where they promote differentiation of naïve T cells to TH-1, TH-2,
TH-17 cells or T regulatory cells. Production of proinflammatory cytokines and
chemokines then follows. Circulating effector and regulatory cells enter the
intestine through a highly selective mechanism that involves interaction with the
vascular endothelium, diapedesis through the vessel wall and migration to the
lamina propria. There are several genes implicated in IBD. Mutations in certain
genes can cause defective down regulation of the innate immune response,
ineffective clearance of intracellular bacteria and proliferation of both luminal
and mucosal-adherent commensal bacteria. IBD is a chronic relapsing inflammatory 
condition that is immune mediated. Results from research in animal models, human 
genetics, basic science and clinical trials provide evidence that it is
heterogeneous, characterized by various genetic abnormalities, leading to a
dysregulated and overly aggressive T cell response to commensal enteric bacteria.
Different genetic abnormalities can be characterized as causing defects in
mucosal barrier function, immunoregulation or bacterial clearance. Advances in
our understanding of the interplay between components of innate and adaptive
immune response will be central to future progress.

BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is an intractable inflammatory bowel disease of 
unknown cause. Recent genome-wide association studies of CD in Korean and
Japanese populations suggested marginal sharing of susceptibility loci between
Caucasian and Asian populations. As the 7 identified loci altogether explain
5.31% of the risk for CD, the objective of this study was to identify additional 
CD susceptibility loci in the Korean population.
METHODS: Using the ImmunoChip custom single-nucleotide polymorphism array
designed for dense genotyping of 186 loci identified through GWAS, we analyzed
722 individuals with CD and 461 controls for 96,048 SNP markers in the discovery 
stage, followed by validation in an additional 948 affected individuals and 977
controls.
RESULTS: We confirmed 6 previously reported loci in Caucasian: GPR35 at 2q37
(rs3749172; P = 5.30 × 10, odds ratio [OR] = 1.45), ZNF365 at 10q21 (rs224143; P 
= 2.20 × 10, OR = 1.38), ZMIZ1 at 10q22 (rs1250569; P = 3.05 × 10, OR = 1.30),
NKX2-3 at 10q24 (rs4409764; P = 7.93 × 10, OR = 1.32), PTPN2 at 18p11 (rs514000; 
P = 9.00 × 10, OR = 1.33), and USP25 at 21q11 (rs2823256; P = 2.49 × 10, OR =
1.35), bringing the number of known CD loci (including 3 in the HLA) in Koreans
to 15. The 6 additional loci increased the total genetic variance for CD risk
from 5.31% to 7.27% in Koreans.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the different genetic backgrounds of CD between Asian and
Western countries has been well established for the major susceptibility genes,
our findings of overlapping associations offer new insights into the genetic
architecture of CD.

Many complex human diseases are highly sexually dimorphic, suggesting a potential
contribution of the X chromosome to disease risk. However, the X chromosome has
been neglected or incorrectly analyzed in most genome-wide association studies
(GWAS). We present tailored analytical methods and software that facilitate
X-wide association studies (XWAS), which we further applied to reanalyze data
from 16 GWAS of different autoimmune and related diseases (AID). We associated
several X-linked genes with disease risk, among which (1) ARHGEF6 is associated
with Crohn's disease and replicated in a study of ulcerative colitis, another
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Indeed, ARHGEF6 interacts with a gastric
bacterium that has been implicated in IBD. (2) CENPI is associated with three
different AID, which is compelling in light of known associations with AID of
autosomal genes encoding centromere proteins, as well as established autosomal
evidence of pleiotropy between autoimmune diseases. (3) We replicated a previous 
association of FOXP3, a transcription factor that regulates T-cell development
and function, with vitiligo; and (4) we discovered that C1GALT1C1 exhibits
sex-specific effect on disease risk in both IBDs. These and other X-linked genes 
that we associated with AID tend to be highly expressed in tissues related to
immune response, participate in major immune pathways, and display differential
gene expression between males and females. Combined, the results demonstrate the 
importance of the X chromosome in autoimmunity, reveal the potential of extensive
XWAS, even based on existing data, and provide the tools and incentive to
properly include the X chromosome in future studies.

Interactions of neurons with microglia may play a dominant role in sleep
regulation. TNF may exert its somnogeneic effects by promoting attraction of
microglia and their processes to the vicinity of dendrites and synapses. We found
TNF to stimulate neurons (i) to produce CCL2, CCL7 and CXCL10, chemokines acting 
on mononuclear phagocytes and (ii) to stimulate the expression of the macrophage 
colony stimulating factor (M-CSF/Csf1), which leads to elongation of microglia
processes. TNF may also act on neurons by affecting the expression of genes
essential in sleep-wake behavior. The neuronal expression of Homer1a mRNA,
increases during spontaneous and enforced periods of wakefulness. Mice with a
deletion of Homer1a show a reduced wakefulness with increased non-rapid eye
movement (NREM) sleep during the dark period. Recently the TNF-dependent increase
of NREM sleep in the dark period of mice with CD40-induced immune activation was 
found to be associated with decreased expression of Homer1a. In the present study
we investigated the effects of TNF and IL-1β on gene expression in cultures of
the neuronal cell line HT22 and cortical neurons. TNF slightly increased the
expression of Homer1a and IL-1β profoundly enhanced the expression of Early
growth response 2 (Egr2). The data presented here indicate that the decreased
expression of Homer1a, which was found in the dark period of mice with
CD40-induced increase of NREM sleep is not due to inhibitory effects of TNF and
IL-1β on the expression of Homer1a in neurons.

Notoginsenoside R1 (R1) is the main bioactive component in Panax notoginseng, an 
old herb medicine widely used in Asian countries in the treatment of
microcirculatory diseases. However, little is known about the effect of R1 on
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The present study demonstrated that R1
alleviated the severity of dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in mice by
decreasing the activity of myeloperoxidase, the production of cytokines, the
expression of proinflammatory genes, and the phosphorylation of IκB kinase, IκBα,
and p65 in the colon. Further studies indicated that R1 dose-dependently
activated human/mouse pregnane X receptor (PXR), a known target for decreasing
inflammation in IBD, and upregulated the expression of genes involved in
xenobiotic metabolism in colorectal cells and the colon. Ligand pocket-filling
mutant (S247W/C284W or S247W/C284W/S208W) of the human PXR abrogated the effect
of R1 on PXR activation. Time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer PXR
competitive binding assay confirmed R1 (ligand) binding affinity. In addition,
PXR overexpression inhibited nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-luciferase activity, which
was potentiated by R1 treatment. PXR knockdown by small interfering RNA
demonstrated the necessity of PXR in R1-induced upregulation of the expression of
xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes and downregulation of NF-κB activity. Finally,
the anti-inflammatory effect of R1 was confirmed in trinitrobenzene sulfonic
acid-induced colitis in mice. These findings suggest that R1 attenuates
experimental IBD possibly via the activation of intestinal PXR signaling.

Extensive genetic studies have identified more than 140 loci predisposing to
Crohn disease (CD). Several major CD susceptibility genes have been shown to
impair biological function with regard to immune response to recognizing and
clearance of bacterial infection. Recent human microbiome studies suggest that
the gut microbiome composition is differentiated in carriers of many risk
variants of major CD susceptibility genes. This interplay between host genetics
and its associated gut microbiome may play an essential role in the pathogenesis 
of CD. The ongoing microbiome research is aimed to investigate the detailed host 
genetics-microbiome interacting mechanism.

The human microbiome consist of the composite genome of native flora that have
evolved with humanity over millennia and which contains 150-fold more genes than 
the human genome. A "healthy" microbiome plays an important role in the
maintenance of health and prevention of illness, inclusive of autoimmune disease 
such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IBD is a prevalent spectrum of
disorders, most notably defined by Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis
(UC), which are associated with considerable suffering, morbidity, and cost. This
review presents an outline of the loss of a normal microbiome as an etiology of
immune dysregulation and IBD pathogenesis initiation. We, furthermore, summarize 
the knowledge on the role of a healthy microbiome in terms of its diversity and
important functional elements and, lastly, conclude with some of the therapeutic 
interventions and modalities that are now being explored as potential
applications of microbiome-host interactions.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this study is to provide an overview of the
role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR)
in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
RECENT FINDINGS: Human genetic studies have identified several UPR-related genes 
and autophagy-related genes as IBD risk loci. Impairment of each branch of the
UPR causes spontaneous enteritis or creates higher susceptibility for intestinal 
inflammation in model systems. Deficiency of either UPR or autophagy in small
intestinal epithelial cells promotes each other's compensatory engagement, which 
is especially prominent in Paneth cells such that, in the absence of both, severe
spontaneous enteritis emerges.
SUMMARY: Interactions between the UPR and autophagy exhibit critical synergistic 
interactions within the intestinal epithelium and especially Paneth cells that
are of considerable importance to the maintenance of homeostasis. When
dysfunctional in the Paneth cell, spontaneous inflammation can emerge that may
extend beyond the epithelium providing direct experimental evidence that subsets 
of Crohn's disease may emanate from primary Paneth cell disturbances.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and relapsing inflammatory disorder
of the gut. Although the precise cause of IBD remains unknown, the most accepted 
hypothesis of IBD pathogenesis to date is that an aberrant immune response
against the gut microbiota is triggered by environmental factors in a genetically
susceptible host. The advancement of next-generation sequencing technology has
enabled identification of various alterations of the gut microbiota composition
in IBD. While some results related to dysbiosis in IBD are different between
studies owing to variations of sample type, method of investigation, patient
profiles, and medication, the most consistent observation in IBD is reduced
bacterial diversity, a decrease of Firmicutes, and an increase of Proteobacteria.
It has not yet been established how dysbiosis contributes to intestinal
inflammation. Many of the known IBD susceptibility genes are associated with
recognition and processing of bacteria, which is consistent with a role of the
gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBD. A number of trials have shown that
therapies correcting dysbiosis, including fecal microbiota transplantation and
probiotics, are promising in IBD.

BACKGROUND: Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified
hundreds of variants associated with a risk for autoimmune and immune-related
disorders (AID), our understanding of the disease mechanisms is still limited. In
particular, more than 90% of the risk variants lie in non-coding regions, and
almost 10% of these map to long non-coding RNA transcripts (lncRNAs). lncRNAs are
known to show more cell-type specificity than protein-coding genes.
METHODS: We aimed to characterize lncRNAs and protein-coding genes located in
loci associated with nine AIDs which have been well-defined by Immunochip
analysis and by transcriptome analysis across seven populations of peripheral
blood leukocytes (granulocytes, monocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, B cells,
memory T cells, naive CD4(+) and naive CD8(+) T cells) and four populations of
cord blood-derived T-helper cells (precursor, primary, and polarized (Th1, Th2)
T-helper cells).
RESULTS: We show that lncRNAs mapping to loci shared between AID are
significantly enriched in immune cell types compared to lncRNAs from the whole
genome (α <0.005). We were not able to prioritize single cell types relevant for 
specific diseases, but we observed five different cell types enriched (α <0.005) 
in five AID (NK cells for inflammatory bowel disease, juvenile idiopathic
arthritis, primary biliary cirrhosis, and psoriasis; memory T and CD8(+) T cells 
in juvenile idiopathic arthritis, primary biliary cirrhosis, psoriasis, and
rheumatoid arthritis; Th0 and Th2 cells for inflammatory bowel disease, juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis, primary biliary cirrhosis, psoriasis, and rheumatoid
arthritis). Furthermore, we show that co-expression analyses of lncRNAs and
protein-coding genes can predict the signaling pathways in which these
AID-associated lncRNAs are involved.
CONCLUSIONS: The observed enrichment of lncRNA transcripts in AID loci implies
lncRNAs play an important role in AID etiology and suggests that lncRNA genes
should be studied in more detail to interpret GWAS findings correctly. The
co-expression results strongly support a model in which the lncRNA and
protein-coding genes function together in the same pathways.

PURPOSE: Dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)-induced colitis is a widely used model for
inflammatory bowel disease. However, various factors including nutrition may
affect the development of this colitis. This study aimed to compare and
characterize the impact of purified and non-purified basal diets on the
development of DSS-induced colitis in the rat.
METHODS: Wistar rats were fed a non-purified or a semi-synthetic purified diet
for 21 days. Colitis was then induced in half of the rats by administration of
DSS in drinking water (4% w/v) during the last 7 days of experimentation. At the 
end of the experimental period, colon sections were taken for histopathological
examination, determination of various markers of inflammation (myeloperoxidase:
MPO, cytokines) and oxidative stress (superoxide dismutase: SOD, catalase: CAT,
glutathione peroxidase: GPx and glutathione reductase: GRed activities), and
evaluation of the expression of various genes implicated in this disorder.
RESULTS: DSS ingestion induced a more marked colitis in animals receiving the
purified diet, as reflected by higher histological score and increased MPO
activity. A significant decrease in SOD and CAT activities was also observed in
rats fed the purified diet. Also, in these animals, administration of DSS induced
a significant increase in interleukin (IL)-1α, IL-1β and IL-6. In addition,
various genes implicated in inflammation were over-expressed after ingestion of
DSS by rats fed the purified diet.
CONCLUSIONS: These results show that a purified diet promotes the onset of a more
severe induced colitis than a non-purified one, highlighting the influence of
basal diet in colitis development.

Intestinal permeability--a new target for disease prevention and therapy.

Watson A, Wells JM.

Data are accumulating that emphasize the important role of the intestinal barrier
and intestinal permeability for health and disease. However, these terms are
poorly defined, their assessment is a matter of debate, and their clinical
significance is not clearly established. In the present review, current knowledge
on mucosal barrier and its role in disease prevention and therapy is summarized. 
First, the relevant terms 'intestinal barrier' and 'intestinal permeability' are 
defined. Secondly, the key element of the intestinal barrier affecting
permeability are described. This barrier represents a huge mucosal surface, where
billions of bacteria face the largest immune system of our body. On the one hand,
an intact intestinal barrier protects the human organism against invasion of
microorganisms and toxins, on the other hand, this barrier must be open to absorb
essential fluids and nutrients. Such opposing goals are achieved by a complex
anatomical and functional structure the intestinal barrier consists of, the
functional status of which is described by 'intestinal permeability'. Third, the 
regulation of intestinal permeability by diet and bacteria is depicted. In
particular, potential barrier disruptors such as hypoperfusion of the gut,
infections and toxins, but also selected over-dosed nutrients, drugs, and other
lifestyle factors have to be considered. In the fourth part, the means to assess 
intestinal permeability are presented and critically discussed. The means vary
enormously and probably assess different functional components of the barrier.
The barrier assessments are further hindered by the natural variability of this
functional entity depending on species and genes as well as on diet and other
environmental factors. In the final part, we discuss selected diseases associated
with increased intestinal permeability such as critically illness, inflammatory
bowel diseases, celiac disease, food allergy, irritable bowel syndrome, and--more
recently recognized--obesity and metabolic diseases. All these diseases are
characterized by inflammation that might be triggered by the translocation of
luminal components into the host. In summary, intestinal permeability, which is a
feature of intestinal barrier function, is increasingly recognized as being of
relevance for health and disease, and therefore, this topic warrants more
attention.

inflammatory diseases of the gut and in the liver by probiotics.

The potential for the positive manipulation of the gut microbiome through the
introduction of beneficial microbes, as also known as probiotics, is currently an
active area of investigation. The FAO/WHO define probiotics as live
microorganisms that confer a health benefit to the host when administered in
adequate amounts. However, dead bacteria and bacterial molecular components may
also exhibit probiotic properties. The results of clinical studies have
demonstrated the clinical potential of probiotics in many pathologies, such as
allergic diseases, diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease and viral infection.
Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the beneficial effects of
probiotics, most of which involve gene expression regulation in specific tissues,
particularly the intestine and liver. Therefore, the modulation of gene
expression mediated by probiotics is an important issue that warrants further
investigation. In the present paper, we performed a systematic review of the
probiotic-mediated modulation of gene expression that is associated with the
immune system and inflammation. Between January 1990 to February 2014, PubMed was
searched for articles that were published in English using the MeSH terms
"probiotics" and "gene expression" combined with "intestines", "liver",
"enterocytes", "antigen-presenting cells", "dendritic cells", "immune system",
and "inflammation". Two hundred and five original articles matching these
criteria were initially selected, although only those articles that included
specific gene expression results (77) were later considered for this review and
separated into three major topics: the regulation of immunity and inflammatory
gene expression in the gut, in inflammatory diseases of the gut and in the liver.
Particular strains of Bifidobacteria, Lactobacilli, Escherichia coli,
Propionibacterium, Bacillus and Saccharomyces influence the gene expression of
mucins, Toll-like receptors, caspases, nuclear factor-κB, and interleukins and
lead mainly to an anti-inflammatory response in cultured enterocytes. In
addition, the interaction of commensal bacteria and probiotics with the surface
of antigen-presenting cells in vitro results in the downregulation of
pro-inflammatory genes that are linked to inflammatory signaling pathways,
whereas other anti-inflammatory genes are upregulated. The effects of probiotics 
have been extensively investigated in animal models ranging from fish to mice,
rats and piglets. These bacteria induce a tolerogenic and hyporesponsive immune
response in which many genes that are related to the immune system, in particular
those genes expressing anti-inflammatory cytokines, are upregulated. By contrast,
information related to gene expression in human intestinal cells mediated by the 
action of probiotics is scarce. There is a need for further clinical studies that
evaluate the mechanism of action of probiotics both in healthy humans and in
patients with chronic diseases. These types of clinical studies are necessary for
addressing the influence of these microorganisms in gene expression for different
pathways, particularly those that are associated with the immune response, and to
better understand the role that probiotics might have in the prevention and
treatment of disease.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Autophagy plays a crucial role in intracellular defense
against various pathogens. Xenophagy is a form of selective autophagy that
targets intracellular pathogens for degradation. In addition, several related,
yet distinct, intracellular defense responses depend on autophagy-related genes. 
This review gives an overview of these processes, pathogen strategies to subvert 
them, and their crosstalk with various cell death programs.
RECENT FINDINGS: The recruitment of autophagy-related proteins plays a key role
in multiple intracellular defense programs, specifically xenophagy,
microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 alpha (LC3)-associated
phagocytosis, and the interferon gamma-mediated elimination of pathogens, such as
Toxoplasma gondii and murine norovirus. Recent progress has revealed methods
employed by pathogens to resist these intracellular defense mechanisms and/or
persist in spite of them. The intracellular pathogen load can tip the balance
between cell survival and cell death. Further, it was recently observed that
LC3-associated phagocytosis is indispensable for the efficient clearance of dying
cells.
SUMMARY: Autophagy-dependent and autophagy-related gene-dependent pathways are
essential in intracellular defense against a broad range of pathogens.

Drug targets and disease genes may work as driver factors at the transcriptional 
level, which propagate signals through gene regulatory network and cause the
downstream genes' differential expression. How to analyze transcriptional
response data to identify meaningful gene modules shared by both drugs and
diseases is still a critical issue for drug-disease associations and molecular
mechanism. In this article, we propose the drug-gene-disease coherent subnetwork 
concept to group the biological function related drugs, diseases, and genes. It
was defined as the subnetwork with drug, gene, and disease as nodes and their
interactions coherently crossing three data layers as edges. Integrating
differential expression profiles of 418 drugs and 84 diseases, we develop a
computational framework and identify 13 coherent subnetworks such as inflammatory
bowel disease and melanoma relevant subnetwork. The results demonstrate that our 
coherent subnetwork approach is able to identify novel drug indications and
highlight their molecular basis.

Many studies have demonstrated the linkage between the IBD3 region (6p21.1-23),
an area which encompasses the famous human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex, and
Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). IBD3 is the only region that
meets genome-wide significance, and provides stronger evidence of the linkage
than 16p13.1-16q12.2 (IBD1), the locus that contains the susceptibility gene
CARD15. However, despite these findings, IBD3 susceptibility genes remain elusive
and unclear due to the strong linkage disequilibrium, extensive polymorphism, and
high gene density that characterize this area and also due to varying allele
frequencies in populations around the world. This area presents an extremely high
abundance of genes, including the classical and non-classical major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II genes, and other genes, namely
MHC class III genes tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and -β, and Hsp, whose proteins
play key functions in immunological processes. To date, it is not clear which
genes within the MHC family contribute to the IBD pathogenesis, although certain 
HLA alleles have been associated with IBD. Recent insights into the biological
function of other genes encoded within the IBD3 region, such as the MHC class I
chain-related (MIC) genes, have led investigators to a more comprehensive
exploration of this region. MHC class I chain-related molecule A (MICA) is highly
polymorphic and interacts with NKG2D, its receptor on the surface of NK, Tγδ and 
T CD8(+) cells. Increased expression of MICA in intestinal epithelial cells and
increased expression of NKG2D in CD4(+) T cells (lamina propria) in patients with
CD have also been reported. MICA alleles have also been associated with IBD, and 
a variation at amino acid position 129 of the α2-heavy chain domain seems to
categorize MICA alleles into strong and weak binders of NKG2D receptor, thereby
influencing the effector cells' function. In this regard, a relevant role of
MICA-129-Val/Met single nucleotide polymorphism has recently been implicated in
the pathogenesis of IBD. TNF-α and -β also play an important role in inflammatory
response. In fact, IBD is commonly treated with TNF-α inhibitors. Additionally,
polymorphisms of TNF-α gene are known to affect the gene expression level and
particular TNF-α genotypes may influence the response of IBD patients treated
with TNF-α inhibitors.

CONTEXT: GH and IGF-1 are believed to be physiological regulators of skeletal
muscle mitochondria.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between
GH/IGF-1 and skeletal muscle mitochondria in obese subjects with reduced GH
secretion in more detail.
DESIGN: Fifteen abdominally obese men with reduced GH secretion were treated for 
12 weeks with recombinant human GH. Subjects underwent (31)P-magnetic resonance
spectroscopy to assess phosphocreatine (PCr) recovery as an in vivo measure of
skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and percutaneous muscle biopsies to assess
mRNA expression of IGF-1 and mitochondrial-related genes at baseline and 12
weeks.
RESULTS: At baseline, skeletal muscle IGF-1 mRNA expression was significantly
associated with PCr recovery (r = 0.79; P = .01) and nuclear respiratory factor-1
(r = 0.87; P = .001), mitochondrial transcription factor A (r = 0.86; P = .001), 
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ (r = 0.72; P = .02), and PPARα
(r = 0.75; P = .01) mRNA expression, and trended to an association with PPARγ
coactivator 1-α (r = 0.59; P = .07) mRNA expression. However, serum IGF-1
concentration was not associated with PCr recovery or any mitochondrial gene
expression (all P > .10). Administration of recombinant human GH increased both
serum IGF-1 (change, 218 ± 29 μg/L; P < .0001) and IGF-1 mRNA in muscle (fold
change, 2.1 ± 0.3; P = .002). Increases in serum IGF-1 were associated with
improvements in total body fat (r = -0.53; P = .04), trunk fat (r = -0.55; P =
.03), and lean mass (r = 0.58; P = .02), but not with PCr recovery (P > .10).
Conversely, increase in muscle IGF-1 mRNA was associated with improvements in PCr
recovery (r = 0.74; P = .02), but not with body composition parameters (P > .10).
CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate a novel association of skeletal muscle
mitochondria with muscle IGF-1 mRNA expression, but independent of serum IGF-1
concentrations.

OBJECTIVES: In the present study, we studied a cohort of patients with very early
onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to determine the frequency of mutations in
the interleukin 10 (IL10) receptor genes as a cause of early-onset IBD.
METHODS: Sanger sequencing was performed to determine the presence of IL10 and/or
IL10 receptor mutations in 17 patients with a diagnosis of very early onset IBD
(disease onset <2 years of age in 15 patients, between 3 and 4 years in the other
2). Mutation screening was performed including all of the coding regions of the
IL10, IL10RA, and IL10RB genes. We then compared the follow-up findings of the
patients with IL10 receptor mutations in terms of demographic, clinical,
laboratory, and treatment response properties with those of patients diagnosed as
having very early onset IBD with no mutation.
RESULTS: We identified 3 patients bearing mutations in the IL10 or IL10 receptor 
genes, including 1 mutation in IL10RB that has been described recently (c.G477A, 
p.Trp159*) and 2 novel mutations affecting the IL10RA gene (c.T192G, p.Tyr64 and 
c.T133G, p.Trp45Gly). Collectively, these mutations thus provided genetic
etiology for 17.6% of the cohort under investigation. The presence of a family
history of IBD and the clinical course of Crohn disease differed between patients
with mutations in the IL-10 pathway and those without such mutations. Although
perianal fistulas were found in all of the patients with IL10 receptor mutations,
they were found in only 14.3% of those without such mutations. The lower values
of weight-for-age and height-for-age z scores, necessity for more intensive
therapy, achievement of longer periods until remission, and frequent relapses in 
the patients bearing mutations in the IL10 receptor genes all underlined the
severity of the disease and its relatively poor response to treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: In spite of the small number of patients with mutations affecting
the IL-10 signaling pathway in our study, in all of the patients with IL10
receptor mutations, the disease onset occurs at an early age, the prognosis is
poor, and the response to treatment is insufficient.

Previous studies have suggested that the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) is
involved in the etiology of Crohn's disease (CD); however, few reports are
available on the association between HLA class I antigens and CD in Japan. In
this study, we performed association analysis of HLA class I antigens in CD using
208 Japanese patients and 384 healthy controls. We identified novel positive
associations between CD and HLA-A*02:01 (odds ratio (OR)=1.64, P=0.016) and
HLA-A*02:07 (OR=2.31, P=0.0067) and confirmed previously reported positive
associations between CD and HLA-Cw*14:02 (OR=2.18, P=0.0021) and HLA-B*51:01
(OR=1.70, P=0.033). We also identified novel negative associations between CD and
HLA-A*24:02 (OR=0.60, P=0.0047) and HLA-B*07:02 (OR=0.38, P=0.0041). Although the
associations were not significant after full Bonferroni correction, we suggested 
that HLA class I genes have dual functions, susceptibility and resistance in
controlling the development of CD.

It recently has been recognized that men develop colonic adenomas and carcinomas 
at an earlier age and at a higher rate than women. In the Apc(Pirc/+) (Pirc) rat 
model of early colonic cancer, this sex susceptibility was recapitulated, with
male Pirc rats developing twice as many adenomas as females. Analysis of large
datasets revealed that the Apc(Min/+) mouse also shows enhanced male
susceptibility to adenomagenesis, but only in the colon. In addition, WT mice
treated with injections of the carcinogen azoxymethane (AOM) showed increased
numbers of colonic adenomas in males. The mechanism underlying these observations
was investigated by manipulation of hormonal status. The preponderance of colonic
adenomas in the Pirc rat model allowed a statistically significant investigation 
in vivo of the mechanism of sex hormone action on the development of colonic
adenomas. Females depleted of endogenous hormones by ovariectomy did not exhibit 
a change in prevalence of adenomas, nor was any effect observed with replacement 
of one or a combination of female hormones. In contrast, depletion of male
hormones by orchidectomy (castration) markedly protected the Pirc rat from
adenoma development, whereas supplementation with testosterone reversed that
effect. These observations were recapitulated in the AOM mouse model. Androgen
receptor was undetectable in the colon or adenomas, making it likely that
testosterone acts indirectly on the tumor lineage. Our findings suggest that
indirect tumor-promoting effects of testosterone likely explain the disparity
between the sexes in the development of colonic adenomas.

BACKGROUND: Very recently, a sub-analysis of genome-wide association scans
revealed that the non-coding single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs12212067 in
the FOXO3A gene is associated with a milder course of Crohn's disease (CD) (Cell 
2013;155:57-69). The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical value of the
SNP rs12212067 in predicting the severity of CD by correlating CD patient
genotype status with the most relevant complications of CD such as stenoses,
fistulas, and CD-related surgery.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We genotyped 550 CD patients for rs12212067
(FOXO3A) and the three common CD-associated NOD2 mutations rs2066844, rs2066847, 
and rs2066847 and performed genotype-phenotype analyses.
RESULTS: No significant phenotypic differences were found between the wild-type
genotype TT of the FOXO3A SNP rs12212067 and the minor genotypes TG and GG
independently from NOD2 variants. The allele frequency of the minor G allele was 
12.7%. Age at diagnosis, disease duration, body mass index, surgery rate,
stenoses, fistula, need for immunosuppressive therapy, and disease course were
not significantly different. In contrast, the NOD2 mutant p.Leu1007fsX1008
(rs2066847) was highly associated with penetrating CD (p = 0.01), the development
of fistulas (p = 0.01) and stenoses (p = 0.01), and ileal disease localization
(p = 0.03). Importantly, the NOD2 SNP rs2066847 was a strong separator between an
aggressive and a mild course of CD (p = 2.99×10(-5)), while the FOXO3A SNP
rs12212067 did not separate between mild and aggressive CD behavior in our cohort
(p = 0.35). 96.2% of the homozygous NOD2 p.Leu1007fsX1008 carriers had an
aggressive disease behavior compared to 69.3% of the patients with the NOD2
wild-type genotype (p = 0.007).
CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: In clinical practice, the NOD2 variant p.Leu1007fsX1008 
(rs2066847), in particular in homozygous form, is a much stronger marker for a
severe clinical phenotype than the FOXO3A rs12212067 SNP for a mild disease
course on an individual patient level despite its important impact on the
inflammatory response of monocytes.

Drug targets and disease genes may work as driver factors at the transcriptional 
level, which propagate signals through gene regulatory network and cause the
downstream genes' differential expression. How to analyze transcriptional
response data to identify meaningful gene modules shared by both drugs and
diseases is still a critical issue for drug-disease associations and molecular
mechanism. In this article, we propose the drug-gene-disease coherent subnetwork 
concept to group the biological function related drugs, diseases, and genes. It
was defined as the subnetwork with drug, gene, and disease as nodes and their
interactions coherently crossing three data layers as edges. Integrating
differential expression profiles of 418 drugs and 84 diseases, we develop a
computational framework and identify 13 coherent subnetworks such as inflammatory
bowel disease and melanoma relevant subnetwork. The results demonstrate that our 
coherent subnetwork approach is able to identify novel drug indications and
highlight their molecular basis. CPT Pharmacometrics Syst. Pharmacol. (2014) 3,

Deficiency in macrophage-stimulating protein results in spontaneous intestinal
inflammation and increased susceptibility toward epithelial damage in zebrafish.

Several genome-wide association studies have identified the genes encoding for
macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP) and its receptor RON (Recepteur d'Origine
Nantais) as possible susceptibility factors in inflammatory bowel disease. While 
it has been shown that the MSP-RON signaling pathway is involved in tissue injury
responses, current mouse models for MSP and RON deficiency have not clearly
demonstrated a role of MSP-RON signaling in the context of intestinal
inflammation. In this study, we report that the recently identified zebrafish Msp
mutant (msp(t34230)) develops spontaneous intestinal inflammation over time. From
14 to 28 weeks postfertilization Msp-deficient zebrafish show intestinal
eosinophilia, increased intestinal expression of inflammatory marker mmp9, and
activation of intestinal goblet cells. Moreover, these Msp mutant zebrafish are
more susceptible toward ethanol-induced epithelial damage, which resulted in
increased infiltration and proliferation of immune cells within the lamina
propria and prolonged intestinal proinflammatory cytokine responses in some
mutant fish. In light of the recent development of many tools to visualize,
monitor, and genetically modify zebrafish, these Msp-deficient zebrafish will
enable in-depth in vivo analysis of epithelial and macrophage-specific MSP-RON
signaling in the context of intestinal inflammation.

Cytokine gene polymorphisms modify expression and their circulating protein
levels reflect inflammatory response. Chronic inflammation plays a key role in
the pathogenesis of colorectal neoplasia (CRN) associated with inflammatory bowel
disease, but it is not clear whether inflammation is a cause or an effect of
tumours in sporadic CRN. We therefore investigated the association of cytokine
gene polymorphisms and circulating cytokine levels on the risk of CRN in
Northeast Scotland, which has a high incidence of CRN. We recruited two groups of
patients from a screening colonoscopy cohort, either preprocedure or 3-24 months 
postprocedure. Participants with CRN were compared with participants with no
evidence of CRN (controls). Blood-derived DNA was used to genotype polymorphisms 
in IL1B, IL1-RN, IL6, IL8, IL10, PTGS2 and TNFA genes. Circulating levels of
high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and six cytokines [interleukin-1β (IL-1β),
IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)] were measured. To
examine the effect of CRN resection on marker levels, we used propensity score
matching. A total of 884 patients were eligible for analysis, including 388 CRN
cases and 496 controls. Cases were older (mean age 64 vs. 62 years, P<0.01) and
more likely to be men (67 vs. 55%, P<0.001). Controls were more likely to be
regular users of NSAID (P<0.0001). Compared with homozygous carriage of
respective common alleles, proinflammatory CC genotypes of IL1B-31C>T [odds ratio
(OR) (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.68 (1.03-2.73)] and PTGS2-765 C>G [OR (95%
CI) 2.97 (1.05-8.46)] were each associated with an increased risk of CRN.
Conversely, carriage of the A allele of IL8-251A>T was associated with a lower
risk of CRN compared with the TT genotype [ORs (95% CI) 0.60 (0.41-0.86) for
heterozygous, 0.88 (0.57-1.37) for homozygous, and 0.68 (0.48-0.95) for
heterozygous and homozygous combined]. Compared with postprocedure cases, IL8,
TNF-α and C-reactive protein levels were significantly higher in preprocedure
cases, but IL4 and IL10 protein levels were significantly lower. Proinflammatory 
cytokine gene polymorphisms in IL1B-31 and PTGS2-765 increase the risk of
developing CRN. Levels of proinflammatory IL8, TNF-α and C-reactive protein
markers are significantly higher while CRN is in situ. Along with the NSAID
findings, these data point to inflammation as an underlying pathogenetic
mechanism in CRN.

Psoriasis is not an autoimmune disease?

The concept that psoriasis is an autoimmune disease needs to be questioned. The
autoimmune label has been based on molecular mimicry between streptococcal and
keratin proteins and the existence of homologous peptides between these proteins.
However, it is only peripheral blood CD8, and not CD4, T lymphocytes that respond
to the homologous peptides. This ignores the fact that it is CD4 T cells which
are necessary to initiate psoriasis. Recent studies on skin bacterial microbiota 
have found a variety of bacteria in both normal skin and psoriatic lesions. In
biopsy specimens, the most common phylum was Firmicutes and the most common genus
streptococcus in both psoriasis and normal skin. The innate immune system is
activated in psoriasis, and recent genetic findings have shown the majority of
susceptibility loci are associated with innate immunity. There is a known
clinical relationship between both Crohn's disease (CD) and periodontitis, and
psoriasis, and patients with psoriasis share mutations in some innate immunity
genes with individuals with CD. It is now accepted that CD is due to a breakdown 
of immune tolerance (dysbiosis) to bacteria in the intestine. These findings
suggest that psoriasis is initiated by an abnormal response to bacteria in the
skin due to genetic factors.

OBJECTIVE: The cornerstone of conventional treatment for inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD) is glucocorticoid (GC). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of
genes such as multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) are related to patient's response to 
GC, and MDR1 polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to IBD in
Caucasians. We aimed to investigate whether the polymorphisms of five genes
including MDR1 influence the response to GC in Chinese patients and the
relationship between MDR1 and IBD susceptibility.
METHODS: SNPs were selected and genotyped in 156 IBD patients treated with GC and
223 healthy controls. Patients were evaluated and classified as GC-dependent,
GC-resistant or responsive to GC after treatment.
RESULTS: The CC genotypes of rs1128503 and rs1045642 in MDR1 gene were more
frequent in Crohn's disease (CD) patients who were GC-dependent than in those
responsive to GC (odds ratio [OR] 6.583, 95% confidence interval [CI]
1.760-24.628, P = 0.019 and OR 3.873, 95% CI 1.578-9.506, P = 0.009,
respectively). The G allele of MDR1 rs2032582 was less frequent among CD patients
than in controls (OR 0.668, 95% CI 0.484-0.921, P = 0.014). G allele carriers
were also less likely to develop non-stricturing and non-penetrating CD (OR
0.661, 95% CI 0.462-0.946, P = 0.023) and ileocolonic CD (OR 0.669, 95% CI
0.472-0.948, P = 0.024).
CONCLUSIONS: Polymorphisms of MDR1 are associated with patient's GC response and 
a predisposition to CD in Chinese population. Further studies are needed to
elucidate the role of MDR1 polymorphisms in IBD and that as genetic markers for
GC response.

BACKGROUND: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating inflammatory bowel
disease of premature infants speculatively associated with infection. Suspected
NEC can be indistinguishable from sepsis, and in established cases an infant may 
die within hours of diagnosis. Present treatment is supportive. A means of
presymptomatic diagnosis is urgently needed. We aimed to identify microbial
signatures in the gastrointestinal microbiota preceding NEC diagnosis in
premature infants.
METHODS: Fecal samples and clinical data were collected from a 2-year cohort of
369 premature neonates. Next-generation sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA gene
regions was used to characterize the microbiota of prediagnosis fecal samples
from 12 neonates with NEC, 8 with suspected NEC, and 44 controls. Logistic
regression was used to determine clinical characteristics and operational
taxonomic units (OTUs) discriminating cases from controls. Samples were cultured 
and isolates identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of
flight. Clostridial isolates were typed and toxin genes detected.
RESULTS: A clostridial OTU was overabundant in prediagnosis samples from infants 
with established NEC (P = .006). Culture confirmed the presence of Clostridium
perfringens type A. Fluorescent amplified fragment-length polymorphism typing
established that no isolates were identical. Prediagnosis samples from NEC
infants not carrying profuse C. perfringens revealed an overabundance of a
Klebsiella OTU (P = .049). Prolonged continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)
therapy with supplemental oxygen was also associated with increased NEC risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Two fecal microbiota signatures (Clostridium and Klebsiella OTUs)
and need for prolonged CPAP oxygen signal increased risk of NEC in presymptomatic
infants. These biomarkers will assist development of a screening tool to allow
very early diagnosis of NEC. Clinical Trials Registration. NCT01102738.

BACKGROUND: Adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) have been implicated in the
ethiopathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). In this study, we analyzed a
collection of intestinal mucosa-associated E. coli isolates, presenting AIEC
phenotypes, isolated from biopsies of CD pediatric patients and non-inflammatory 
bowel diseases (IBD) controls, in order to investigate their genetic and
phenotypic pathogenic features.
RESULTS: A total of 616 E. coli isolates from biopsies of four pediatric CD
patients and of four non-IBD controls were collected and individually analyzed.
For AIEC identification, adherent isolates were assayed for invasiveness, and the
capacity of the adhesive-invasive isolates to survive and replicate
intracellularly was determined over macrophages J774. In this way we identified
36 AIEC-like isolates. Interestingly, their relative abundance was significantly 
higher in CD patients (10%; 31/308) than in non-IBD controls (1%; 5/308) (χ2 =
38.96 p < 0.001). Furthermore pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and
randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) techniques were applied to analyze the 
clonality of the 36 AIEC-like isolates. The results obtained allowed us to
identify 27 distinct genotypes (22 from CD patients and 5 from non-IBD controls).
As for the AIEC prototype strain LF82, all 27 AIEC genotypes presented an
aggregative pattern of adherence (AA) that was inhibited by D-mannose, indicating
that adhesiveness of AIEC is likely mediated by type 1 pili. PCR analisys was
used to investigate presence of virulence genes. The results indicated that among
the 27 AIEC isolates, the incidence of genes encoding virulence factors K1 (χ2 = 
6.167 P = 0.013), kpsMT II (χ2 = 6.167 P = 0.013), fyuA (χ2 = 6.167 P = 0.013),
and ibeA (χ2 = 8.867 P = 0.003) was significantly higher among AIEC strains
isolated from CD patients than non-IBD controls.
CONCLUSIONS: The identification of AIEC strains in both CD and non-IBD controls, 
confirmed the "pathobiont" nature of AIEC strains. The finding that AIEC-like
isolates were more abundant in CD patients, indicates that a close association of
these strains with CD may also exists in pediatric patients.

Aneuploidy is a common feature in the colonic mucosa of patients suffering from
the inflammatory bowel disease ulcerative colitis (UC) and often precedes the
development of dysplasia and cancer. Aneuploidy is assumed to be caused by
missegregation of chromosomes during mitosis, often due to a faulty spindle
assembly checkpoint. p53 is a tumour suppressor protein known to regulate the
spindle assembly checkpoint and is frequently mutated in aneuploid cells. Aurora 
A is a presumed oncoprotein, also involved in regulation of the spindle assembly 
checkpoint. In the present study, we examined the mutational frequency of TP53
and the protein levels of p53 in a set of 20 progressor and 10 non-progressor
colectomies from patients suffering from longstanding UC. In addition, we
re-examined previously published immunohistochemical data on Aurora A expression 
using the same material. Levels of Aurora A were re-examined with regard to DNA
ploidy status and dysplasia within the progressors, as well as in relation to p53
accumulation and TP53 mutational status. We detected p53 accumulation only within
the progressor colectomies, where it could be followed back 14 years prior to the
colectomies, in pre-colectomy biopsies. TP53 mutations were detected in both
progressors and non-progressors. Expression levels of Aurora A were similar in
the progressors and non-progressors. Within the group of progressors however, low
levels of Aurora A were associated with areas of DNA aneuploidy, as well as with 
increasing degrees of dysplasia. Our results indicate that alterations in p53 may
be an early biomarker of a progressor colon, and that p53 is accumulated early in
UC-related carcinogenesis. Furthermore, a decreased Aurora A expression is

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a key role in innate immunity. Apart from their
function in host defense, dysregulation in TLR signalling can confer risk to
autoimmune diseases, septic shock or cancer. Here we report genetic variants and 
transcripts that are active only during TLR signalling and contribute to
interindividual differences in immune response. Comparing unstimulated versus
TLR4-stimulated monocytes reveals 1,471 expression quantitative trait loci
(eQTLs) that are unique to TLR4 stimulation. Among these we find functional SNPs 
for the expression of NEU4, CCL14, CBX3 and IRF5 on TLR4 activation. Furthermore,
we show that SNPs conferring risk to primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC),
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and celiac disease are immune response eQTLs for
PDGFB and IL18R1. Thus, PDGFB and IL18R1 represent plausible candidates for
studying the pathophysiology of these disorders in the context of TLR4
activation. In summary, this study presents novel insights into the genetic basis
of the innate immune response and exemplifies the value of eQTL studies in the
context of exogenous cell stimulation.

Systemic 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment ameliorating murine inflammatory bowel diseases
(IBD) could not be applied to patients because of hypercalcemia. We tested the
hypothesis that increasing 1,25(OH)2D3 synthesis locally by targeting delivery of
the 1α-hydroxylase gene (CYP27B1) to the inflamed bowel would ameliorate IBD
without causing hypercalcemia. Our targeting strategy is the use of
CD11b(+)/Gr1(+) monocytes as the cell vehicle and a macrophage-specific promoter 
(Mac1) to control CYP27B1 expression. The CD11b(+)/Gr1(+) monocytes migrated
initially to inflamed colon and some healthy tissues in dextran sulfate sodium
(DSS) colitis mice; however, only the migration of monocytes to the inflamed
colon was sustained. Adoptive transfer of Gr1(+) monocytes did not cause hepatic 
injury. Infusion of Mac1-CYP27B1-modified monocytes increased body weight gain,
survival, and colon length, and expedited mucosal regeneration. Expression of
pathogenic Th17 and Th1 cytokines (interleukin (IL)-17a and interferon (IFN)-α)
was decreased, while expression of protective Th2 cytokines (IL-5 and IL-13) was 
increased, by the treatment. This therapy also enhanced tight junction gene
expression in the colon. No hypercalcemia occurred following this therapy. In
conclusion, we have for the first time obtained proof-of-principle evidence for a
novel monocyte-based adoptive CYP27B1 gene therapy using a mouse IBD model. This 
strategy could be developed into a novel therapy for IBD and other autoimmune
diseases.

There is interest in understanding post-translational modifications of proteins
in inflammatory disease. Neddylation is the conjugation of the molecule neural
precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated 8 (NEDD8) to promote
protein stabilization. Cullins are a family of NEDD8 targets important in the
stabilization and degradation of proteins, such as hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF;
via Cullin-2). Here, we elucidate the role of human deneddylase-1 (DEN-1, also
called SENP8) in inflammatory responses in vitro and in vivo and define
conditions for targeting neddylation in models of mucosal inflammation. HIF
provides protection in inflammatory models, so we examined the contribution of
DEN-1 to HIF stabilization. Pharmacologic targeting of neddylation activity with 
MLN4924 (IC50, 4.7 nM) stabilized HIF-1α, activated HIF promoter activity by
2.5-fold, and induced HIF-target genes in human epithelial cells up to 5-fold.
Knockdown of DEN-1 in human intestinal epithelial cells resulted in increased
kinetics in barrier formation, decreased permeability, and enhanced barrier
restitution by 2 ± 0.5-fold. Parallel studies in vivo revealed that MLN4924
abrogated disease severity in murine dextran sulfate sodium colitis, including
weight loss, colon length, and histologic severity. We conclude that DEN-1 is a
regulator of cullin neddylation and fine-tunes the inflammatory response in vitro
and in vivo. Pharmacologic inhibition of cullin neddylation may provide a
therapeutic opportunity in mucosal inflammatory disease.

Tumor progression locus-2 (Tpl2) kinase is a major inflammatory mediator in
immune cell types recently found to be genetically associated with inflammatory
bowel diseases (IBDs). Here we show that Tpl2 may exert a dominant homeostatic
rather than inflammatory function in the intestine mediated specifically by
subepithelial intestinal myofibroblasts (IMFs). Mice with complete or
IMF-specific Tpl2 ablation are highly susceptible to epithelial injury-induced
colitis showing impaired compensatory proliferation in crypts and extensive
ulcerations without significant changes in inflammatory responses. Following
epithelial injury, IMFs sense innate or inflammatory signals and activate, via
Tpl2, the cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2)-prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) pathway, which we show
here to be essential for the epithelial homeostatic response. Exogenous PGE2
administration rescues mice with complete or IMF-specific Tpl2 ablation from
defects in crypt function and susceptibility to colitis. We also show that Tpl2
expression is decreased in IMFs isolated from the inflamed ileum of IBD patients 
indicating that Tpl2 function in IMFs may be highly relevant to human disease.
The IMF-mediated mechanism we propose also involves the IBD-associated genes
IL1R1, MAPK1, and the PGE2 receptor-encoding PTGER4. Our results establish a
previously unidentified myofibroblast-specific innate pathway that regulates
intestinal homeostasis and may underlie IBD susceptibility in humans.

Newborns adjust to the extrauterine environment by developing intestinal immune
homeostasis. Appropriate initial bacterial colonization is necessary for adequate
intestinal immune development. An environmental determinant of adequate
colonization is breast milk. Although the full-term infant is developmentally
capable of mounting an immune response, the effector immune component requires
bacterial stimulation. Breast milk stimulates the proliferation of a
well-balanced and diverse microbiota, which initially influences a switch from an
intrauterine TH2 predominant to a TH1/TH2 balanced response and with activation
of T-regulatory cells by breast milk-stimulated specific organisms
(Bifidobacteria, Lactobacillus, and Bacteroides). As an example of its effect,
oligosaccharides in breast milk are fermented by colonic bacteria producing an
acid milieu for bacterial proliferation. In addition, short-chain fatty acids in 
breast milk activate receptors on T-reg cells and bacterial genes, which
preferentially mediate intestinal tight junction expression and
anti-inflammation. Other components of breast milk (defensins, lactoferrin, etc.)
inhibit pathogens and further contribute to microbiota composition. The breast
milk influence on initial intestinal microbiota also prevents expression of
immune-mediated diseases (asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, type 1 diabetes)
later in life through a balanced initial immune response, underscoring the
necessity of breastfeeding as the first source of nutrition.

We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of IgA nephropathy (IgAN),
the most common form of glomerulonephritis, with discovery and follow-up in
20,612 individuals of European and East Asian ancestry. We identified six new
genome-wide significant associations, four in ITGAM-ITGAX, VAV3 and CARD9 and two
new independent signals at HLA-DQB1 and DEFA. We replicated the nine previously
reported signals, including known SNPs in the HLA-DQB1 and DEFA loci. The
cumulative burden of risk alleles is strongly associated with age at disease
onset. Most loci are either directly associated with risk of inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD) or maintenance of the intestinal epithelial barrier and response to
mucosal pathogens. The geospatial distribution of risk alleles is highly
suggestive of multi-locus adaptation, and genetic risk correlates strongly with
variation in local pathogens, particularly helminth diversity, suggesting a
possible role for host-intestinal pathogen interactions in shaping the genetic
landscape of IgAN.

BACKGROUND: Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) produces the Bacteroides 
fragilis toxin, which has been associated with acute diarrheal disease,
inflammatory bowel disease, and colorectal cancer (CRC). ETBF induces colon
carcinogenesis in experimental models. Previous human studies have demonstrated
frequent asymptomatic fecal colonization with ETBF, but no study has investigated
mucosal colonization that is expected to impact colon carcinogenesis.
METHODS: We compared the presence of the bft gene in mucosal samples from
colorectal neoplasia patients (cases, n = 49) to a control group undergoing
outpatient colonoscopy for CRC screening or diagnostic workup (controls, n = 49).
Single bacterial colonies isolated anaerobically from mucosal colon tissue were
tested for the bft gene with touch-down polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: The mucosa of cases was significantly more often bft-positive on left
(85.7%) and right (91.7%) tumor and/or paired normal tissues compared with left
and right control biopsies (53.1%; P = .033 and 55.5%; P = .04, respectively).
Detection of bft was concordant in most paired mucosal samples from individual
cases or controls (75% cases; 67% controls). There was a trend toward increased
bft positivity in mucosa from late- vs early-stage CRC patients (100% vs 72.7%,
respectively; P = .093). In contrast to ETBF diarrheal disease where bft-1
detection dominates, bft-2 was the most frequent toxin isotype identified in both
cases and controls, whereas multiple bft isotypes were detected more frequently
in cases (P ≤ .02).
CONCLUSIONS: The bft gene is associated with colorectal neoplasia, especially in 
late-stage CRC. Our results suggest that mucosal bft exposure is common and may
be a risk factor for developing CRC.

BACKGROUND: Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a phenomenon that
allows the conversion of adherent epithelial cells to a mesenchymal cell
phenotype, which enhances migratory capacity and invasiveness. Recent studies
have suggested that EMT contributes to the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis
(UC). We investigated the promoter DNA methylation status of EMT-related genes in
the colonic mucosa in UC.
METHODS: Colonic biopsies were obtained from the rectal inflammatory mucosa of 86
UC patients and the non-inflammatory proximal colonic mucosa of 10 paired
patients. Bisulfite pyrosequencing was used to quantify the methylation of 5
candidate CpG island promoters (NEUROG1, CDX1, miR-1247, CDH1, and CDH13) and
LINE1.
RESULTS: Using an unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis, inflamed rectal 
mucosa was well separated from mucosa that appeared normal. The CDH1 and CDH13
promoters were significantly associated with patient age (p = 0.04, 0.03,
respectively). A similar trend was found between those genes and the duration of 
disease (CDH1: p = 0.07, CDH13: p = 0.0002, mean of both: p<0.00001). Several
positive associations were found between hypermethylation and severe clinical
phenotypes (CDX1 and miR-1247 and a refractory phenotype: p = 0.04 and 0.006,
respectively. miR-1247 and CDH1 hyper methylation and a more severe Mayo
endoscopic subscore: miR-1247: p = 0.0008, CDH1: p = 0.03, mean of both: p =
0.003). When the severe clinical phenotype was defined as having any of five
phenotypes (hospitalized more than twice, highest Mayo endoscopic subscore,
steroid dependence, refractory, or a history of surgery) miR-1247
hypermethylation was associated with the same phenotype (p = 0.008).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that variability in the methylation status of
EMT-related genes is associated with more severe clinical phenotypes in UC.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate whether NLRP3 is associated with IBD
in Chinese Han population.
METHODS: Three SNPs were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction with
sequence-specific primers in 288 patients [232 Crohn's disease (CD) patients, 56 
ulcerative colitis (UC) patients] and 274 controls.
RESULTS: In IBD group, the results showed no significant association. When
subdivided to CD and UC, it showed in CD subgroup, there was no significant
association. However, in UC subgroup, rs10754558 (P allele=0.015272, P
genotype=0.029776, OR [95% CI]=0.604190[0.401200-0.909886]) and rs10925019 (P
allele=0.013042, P genotype=0.037045, OR [95% CI]=2.022613[1.149854-3.557812])
have significant associations with UC. The G and T alleles were risk factors of
the susceptibility of UC, the GG and TT genotypes may increase risk of this
disease. Rs4925648 has no association with UC. The haplotypes analysis results
showed as follow: for rs4925648-rs10925019, CC and TT are risk factors for UC
(for CC, χ2=3.605, P=0.057613, OR [95% CI]=1.645 [0.980-2.761], for TT, χ2=5.522,
P=0.018804, OR [95% CI]=0.426[0.205-0.884]), and for rs10754558-rs10925019, CT
and GC haplotypes are risk factors for UC (for CT, χ2=3.545, P=0.059739, OR [95% 
CI]=0.571[0.317-1.029], for GC, χ2=9.359, P=0.002228, OR [95% CI]=1.904
[1.255-2.887]).
CONCLUSIONS: We first demonstrated that rs10754558 and rs10925019 are
significantly associated with the susceptibility of UC, but not CD in Chinese Han
population, suggesting that NLRP3 may play an important role in the pathogenesis 
of UC.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To highlight recent findings that identify an essential role
for the cellular degradative pathway of autophagy in governing a balanced
response to intestinal pathogens and commensals.
RECENT FINDINGS: Following the genetic association of autophagy with inflammatory
bowel disease susceptibility, increasing evidence indicates that this pathway
functions in various epithelial lineages to support the intestinal barrier. New
studies are also revealing that autophagy proteins dictate the quality and
magnitude of immune responses. Mouse models, in particular, suggest that
autophagy and inflammatory bowel disease susceptibility genes regulate
inflammatory responses to viruses, a finding that coincides with an increasing
appreciation that viruses have intricate interactions with the host and the
microbiota beyond the obvious host-pathogen relationship.
SUMMARY: Autophagy and other immunological or stress response pathways intersect 
in mucosal immunity to dictate the response to pathogenic and commensal agents.
The development of novel treatment strategies, as well as prognostic and
diagnostic tools for gastrointestinal disorders, will be greatly facilitated by a
deeper understanding of these interactions at the cell type and microbe-specific 
manner, which includes less appreciated components of the microbiota, such as
eukaryotic and prokaryotic viruses.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) is a nuclear receptor,
originally described in adipose tissue, which controls the expression of a large 
number of regulatory genes in lipid metabolism and insulin sensitization. Well
known by endocrinologists, thiazolidinedionesare classical PPARγ synthetic
agonists, which were currently used as insulin-sensitizing agents in the
treatment of type 2 diabetes. Although the clinical benefits of
thiazolidinediones in treating metabolic disorders have been clearly
demonstrated, studies performed in animal models of colitis and in patients with 
ulcerative colitis have also revealed the key roles of PPARγ activation in the
regulation of inflammation and immune response, notably in the colon through
epithelial cells.

Living organisms take in essential molecules and get rid of wastes effectively
through the selective transport of materials. Especially in the digestive tract, 
advanced transport systems are indispensable for the absorption of nutrients and 
elimination of waste products. These transport pathways control physiological
functions by modulating the ionic environment inside and outside the cells.
Moreover, recent studies have shown the importance of the expression of
trafficking-related molecules and the population of gut microbiota. We found that
the molecules secreted from microorganisms are imported into the cells via
transporters or endocytosis and that they activate cell survival pathways of
intestinal epithelial cells. These findings indicate that the interactions
between the gut microbiota and host cells are mediated, at least partly, by the
membrane transport systems. In addition, it is well known that the breakdown of
transport systems induces various diseases. This review highlights the
significance of the transport systems as the pathogenic molecules and therapeutic
targets in gastrointestinal disorders. For example, abnormal expression of the
genes encoding membrane transport-related molecules is frequently involved in
digestive diseases, such as colorectal cancer and inflammatory bowel disease. We 
herein review the significance of these molecules as pathogenic and therapeutic
targets for digestive diseases.

Ulcerative colitis is the most prevailing entity of several disorders under the
umbrella term inflammatory bowel disease, with potentially serious symptoms and
devastating consequences for affected patients. The exact molecular etiology of
ulcerative colitis is not yet revealed. In this study, we characterized the
molecular phenotype of ulcerative colitis through transcriptomic and metabonomic 
profiling of colonic mucosal biopsies from patients and controls. We have
characterized the extent to which metabonomic and transcriptomic molecular
phenotypes are associated with ulcerative colitis versus controls and other
disease-related phenotypes such as steroid dependency and age at diagnosis, to
determine if there is evidence of enrichment of differential expression in
candidate genes from genome-wide association studies and if there are particular 
pathways influenced by disease-associated genes. Both transcriptomic and
metabonomic data have previously been shown to predict the clinical course of
ulcerative colitis and related clinical phenotypes, indicating that molecular
phenotypes reveal molecular changes associated with the disease. Our analyses
indicate that variables of both transcriptomics and metabonomics are associated
with disease case and control status, that a large proportion of transcripts are 
associated with at least one metabolite in mucosal colonic biopsies, and that
multiple pathways are connected to disease-related metabolites and transcripts.

The inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family members, notably cIAP1, cIAP2, and XIAP, 
are critical and universal regulators of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) mediated
survival, inflammatory, and death signaling pathways. Furthermore, IAPs mediate
the signaling of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)1/NOD2 and other 
intracellular NOD-like receptors in response to bacterial pathogens. These
pathways are important to the pathogenesis and treatment of inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD). Inactivating mutations in the X-chromosome-linked IAP (XIAP) gene 
causes an immunodeficiency syndrome, X-linked lymphoproliferative disease type 2 
(XLP2), in which 20% of patients develop severe intestinal inflammation. In
addition, 4% of males with early-onset IBD also have inactivating mutations in
XIAP. Therefore, the IAPs play a greater role in gut homeostasis, immunity and
IBD development than previously suspected, and may have therapeutic potential.

Rutin, one of the most abundant flavonoids in nature, has been shown to exert
intestinal antiinflammatory effects in experimental models of colitis. Our aim
was to study the antiinflamatory effect of rutin in the CD4+ CD62L+ T cell
transfer model of colitis, one of the closest to the human disease. Colitis was
induced by transfer of CD4+ CD62L+ T cells to Rag1(-/-) mice. Rutin was
administered by gavage as a postreatment. Treatment with rutin improved colitis
at the dose of 57mg/kg/day, while no effect was noted with 28.5mg/kg/day.
Therapeutic benefit was evidenced by a reduced disease activity index, weight
loss and damage score, plus a 36% lower colonic myeloperoxidase and a 54% lower
alkaline phosphatase activity. In addition, a decreased secretion of
proinflammatory cytokines (IFNγ and TNFα) by mesenteric lymph node cells was
observed ex vivo. The colonic expression of proinflammatory genes, including
IFNγ, TNFα, CXCL1, S100A8 and IL-1β, was significantly reduced by more than 80%
with rutin as assessed by RT-qPCR. Flavonoid treated mice exhibited decreased
activation of splenic CD4+ cells (STAT4 phosphorylation and IFNγ expression) and 
reduced plasma cytokine levels. This effect was also apparent in mucosal
lymphocytes based on reduced STAT4 phosphorylation. The protective effect was
comparable to that of 3mg/kg/day budesonide. Rutin had no effect on splenocytes
or murine T cells in vitro, while its aglycone, quercetin, exhibited a
concentration dependent inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines, including IFNγ. 
Rutin but not quercetin showed vectorial basolateral to apical transport in IEC18
cells, associated with reduced biotransformation. We conclude that rutin exerts
intestinal antiinflammatory activity in chronic, T lymphocyte dependent colitis
via quercetin release and actions involving mucosal and lymph node T cells. Our
results suggest that rutin may be useful in the management of inflammatory bowel 
disease in appropriate dosage conditions.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Some patients with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea
(IBS-D) have intestinal hyperpermeability, which contributes to their diarrhea
and abdominal pain. MicroRNA 29 (MIR29) regulates intestinal permeability in
patients with IBS-D. We investigated and searched for targets of MIR29 and
investigated the effects of disrupting Mir29 in mice.
METHODS: We investigated expression MIR29A and B in intestinal biopsies collected
during endoscopy from patients with IBS (n = 183) and without IBS (controls) (n =
36). Levels were correlated with disease phenotype. We also generated and studied
Mir29(-/-) mice, in which expression of Mir29a and b, but not c, is lost. Colitis
was induced by administration of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid; intestinal
tissues were collected and permeability was assessed. Microarray analysis was
performed using tissues from Mir29(-/-) mice. Changes in levels of target genes
were measured in human colonic epithelial cells and small intestinal epithelial
cells after knockdown of MIR29 with anti-MIRs.
RESULTS: Intestinal tissues from patients with IBS-D (but not IBS with
constipation or controls) had increased levels of MIR29A and B, but reduced
levels of Claudin-1 (CLDN1) and nuclear factor-κB-repressing factor (NKRF).
Induction of colitis and water avoidance stress increased levels of Mir29a and
Mir29b and intestinal permeability in wild-type mice; these increased intestinal 
permeability in colons of far fewer Mir29(-/-) mice. In microarray and knockdown 
experiments, MIR29A and B were found to reduce levels of NKRF and CLDN1 messenger
RNA, and alter levels of other messenger RNAs that regulate intestinal
permeability.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on experiments in knockout mice and analyses of intestinal
tissue samples from patients with IBS-D, MIR29 targets and reduces expression of 
CLDN1 and NKRF to increase intestinal permeability. Strategies to block MIR29
might be developed to restore intestinal permeability in patients with IBS-D.

The pathogenesis of complex diseases, such as type 1 diabetes (T1D), derives from
interactions between host genetics and environmental factors. Previous studies
have suggested that viral infection plays a significant role in initiation of T1D
in genetically predisposed individuals. T1D susceptibility loci may therefore be 
enriched in previously uncharacterized genes functioning in antiviral defense
pathways. To identify genes involved in antiviral immunity, we performed an
image-based high-throughput genetic screen using short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs)
against 161 genes within T1D susceptibility loci. RAW 264.7 cells transduced with
shRNAs were infected with GFP-expressing herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and 
fluorescent microscopy was performed to assess the viral infectivity by
fluorescence reporter activity. Of the 14 candidates identified with high
confidence, two candidates were selected for further investigation, Il27 and
Tagap. Administration of recombinant IL-27 during viral infection was found to
act synergistically with interferon gamma (IFN-γ) to activate expression of type 
I IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines, and to enhance the activities of interferon
regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). Consistent with a role in antiviral immunity,
Tagap-deficient macrophages demonstrated increased viral replication, reduced
expression of proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines, and decreased production 
of IFN-β. Taken together, our unbiased loss-of-function genetic screen identifies
genes that play a role in host antiviral immunity and delineates roles for IL-27 
and Tagap in the production of antiviral cytokines.

Recent Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have revealed numerous Crohn's
disease susceptibility genes and a key challenge now is in understanding how risk
polymorphisms in associated genes might contribute to development of this
disease. For a gene to contribute to disease phenotype, its risk variant will
likely adversely communicate with a variety of other gene products to result in
dysregulation of common signaling pathways. A vital challenge is to elucidate
pathways of potentially greatest influence on pathological behaviour, in a manner
recognizing how multiple relevant genes may yield integrative effect. In this
work we apply mathematical analysis of networks involving the list of recently
described Crohn's susceptibility genes, to prioritise pathways in relation to
their potential development of this disease. Prioritisation was performed by
applying a text mining and a diffusion based method (GRAIL, GPEC). Prospective
biological significance of the resulting prioritised list of proteins is
highlighted by changes in their gene expression levels in Crohn's patients
intestinal tissue in comparison with healthy donors.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation between decoy receptor (DcR)1, DcR2 and
osteoprotegerin (OPG) gene polymorphisms with the susceptibility to ulcerative
colitis (UC) in Chinese population.
METHODS: A total of 352 patients with UC as well as 463 sex- and age-matched
healthy controls were recruited in the study. The genetic polymorphisms of DcR1
(rs12549481), DcR2 (rs1133782) and OPG (rs3102735) were determined using a
mini-sequencing technique method.
RESULTS: In the autosomal dominant model, the rates of mutant allele (A) and
genotype (GA+AA) of DcR2 (rs1133782) were lower in UC patients compared to the
controls [6.25% (44/704) vs 8.96% (83/926), P = 0.043; 11.36% (40/352) vs 17.28% 
(80/463), P = 0.018, respectively]. In the recessive model, moreover, we found
that the rates of mutant allele (T) and homozygote (TT) of OPG(rs3102735) were
significantly increased in UC patients in contrast with the controls [86.36%
(608/704) vs 81.53% (755/926), P = 0.009; 75.28% (265/352) vs 66.95% (310/463), P
= 0.010, respectively]. By means of unconditional Logistic regression analysis,
the rate of mutant allele (T) of OPG (rs3102735) was shown to be significantly
decreased in patients with severe UC compared to the other UC patients [76.67%
(69/90) vs 87.79% (539/614), OR = 0.457, 95%CI 0.265-0.788, P = 0.004].
Nevertheless, the genetic polymorphism of DcR2(rs1133782) was not significantly
related to the clinical features in UC patients. In addition, the genotypic
distribution of DcR1 (rs12549481) in control group did not conform to the
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium rule, thus a further statistical analysis was not
performed in our study.
CONCLUSIONS: The genetic polymorphism of DcR2(rs1133782) might be associated with
the susceptibility to UC. Not only is the mutation of OPG (rs3102735) gene
correlated to the development of UC, but also to the severity of disease.

AIM: Epidemiological and clinical studies indicated a relationship of
periodontitis with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We aimed to identify shared genetic
susceptibility loci of RA and periodontitis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-seven risk genes of genome-wide significance of RA
and SLE were genotyped in a German case-control sample of aggressive
periodontitis (AgP), using Immunochip genotyping arrays (Illumina, 600 cases,
1440 controls) and Affymetrix 500 K Genotyping Arrays (280 cases and 983
controls). Significant associations were replicated in 168 Dutch AgP cases and
679 controls and adjusted for the confounders smoking and sex.
RESULTS: Variants at IRF5 and PRDM1 showed association with AgP. Upon covariate
adjustment for smoking and sex, the most strongly associated variant at IRF5 was 
the rare variant rs62481981 (ppooled  = 0.0012, odds ratio [OR] = 3.1, 95%
confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.6-6.1; 801 cases, 1476 controls).Within PRDM1 it
was rs6923419 (ppooled  = 0.004, OR = 0.7, 95% CI = 0.6-0.9; 833 cases, 1440
controls). The associations lost significance after correction for multiple
testing in the replication. Both genes are implicated in beta-interferon
signalling and are also genome-wide associated with SLE and inflammatory bowel
disease.
CONCLUSION: The study gives no definite evidence for a pathogenic genetic link of
periodontitis and RA but suggests IRF5 and PRDM1 as shared susceptibility
factors.

The Puerto Rico population may be modeled as an admixed population with
contributions from three continents: Sub-Saharan Africa, Ancient America, and
Europe. Extending the study of the genetics of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
to an admixed population such as Puerto Rico has the potential to shed light on
IBD genes identified in studies of European populations, find new genes
contributing to IBD susceptibility, and provide basic information on IBD for the 
care of US patients of Puerto Rican and Latino descent. In order to study the
association between immune-related genes and Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative 
colitis (UC) in Puerto Rico, we genotyped 1159 Puerto Rican cases, controls, and 
family members with the ImmunoChip. We also genotyped 832 subjects from the Human
Genome Diversity Panel to provide data for estimation of global and local
continental ancestry. Association of SNPs was tested by logistic regression
corrected for global continental descent and family structure. We observed the
association between Crohn's disease and NOD2 (rs17313265, 0.28 in CD, 0.19 in
controls, OR 1.5, p = 9×10-6) and IL23R (rs11209026, 0.026 in CD, 0.0.071 in
controls, OR 0.4, p = 3.8×10-4). The haplotype structure of both regions
resembled that reported for European populations and "local" continental ancestry
of the IL23R gene was almost entirely of European descent. We also observed
suggestive evidence for the association of the BAZ1A promoter SNP with CD
(rs1200332, 0.45 in CD, 0.35 in controls, OR 1.5, p = 2×10-6). Our estimate of
continental ancestry surrounding this SNP suggested an origin in Ancient America 
for this putative susceptibility region. Our observations underscored the great
difference between global continental ancestry and local continental ancestry at 
the level of the individual gene, particularly for immune-related loci.

MOTIVATION: With the advance of new sequencing technologies producing massive
short reads data, metagenomics is rapidly growing, especially in the fields of
environmental biology and medical science. The metagenomic data are not only high
dimensional with large number of features and limited number of samples but also 
complex with a large number of zeros and skewed distribution. Efficient
computational and statistical tools are needed to deal with these unique
characteristics of metagenomic sequencing data. In metagenomic studies, one main 
objective is to assess whether and how multiple microbial communities differ
under various environmental conditions.
RESULTS: We propose a two-stage statistical procedure for selecting informative
features and identifying differentially abundant features between two or more
groups of microbial communities. In the functional analysis of metagenomes, the
features may refer to the pathways, subsystems, functional roles and so on. In
the first stage of the proposed procedure, the informative features are selected 
using elastic net as reducing the dimension of metagenomic data. In the second
stage, the differentially abundant features are detected using generalized linear
models with a negative binomial distribution. Compared with other available
methods, the proposed approach demonstrates better performance for most of the
comprehensive simulation studies. The new method is also applied to two real
metagenomic datasets related to human health. Our findings are consistent with
those in previous reports.

Interleukin 17 (IL-17) is a pleiotropic cytokine that acts on both immune and
non-immune cells and is generally implicated in inflammatory and autoimmune
diseases. Although IL-17 as well as their source, mainly but not limited to Th17 
cells, is also abundant in the inflamed intestine, the role of IL-17 in
inflammatory bowel disease remains controversial. In the present study, by using 
IL-17 knockout (KO) mice, we investigated the role of IL-17 in colitis, with
special focus on the macrophage subpopulations. Here we show that IL-17KO mice
had increased susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis which was associated with
decrease in expression of mRNAs implicated in M2 and/or wound healing
macrophages, such as IL-10, IL-1 receptor antagonist, arginase 1, cyclooxygenase 
2, and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase. Lamina propria leukocytes from inflamed colon
of IL-17KO mice contained fewer CD11b+Ly6C+MHC Class II+ macrophages, which were 
derived, at least partly, from blood monocytes, as compared to those of WT mice. 
FACS-purified CD11b+ cells from WT mice, which were more abundant in Ly6C+MHC
Class II+ cells, expressed increased levels of genes associated M2/wound healing 
macrophages and also M1/proinflammatory macrophages. Depletion of this population
by topical administration of clodronate-liposome in the colon of WT mice resulted
in the exacerbation of colitis. These results demonstrate that IL-17 confers
protection against the development of severe colitis through the induction of an 
atypical M2-like macrophage subpopulation. Our findings reveal a previously
unappreciated mechanism by which IL-17 exerts a protective function in colitis.

OBJECTIVE: Crohn's disease (CD) is caused by a complex interplay among genetic,
microbial and environmental factors. ATG16L1 is an important genetic factor
involved in innate immunity, including autophagy and phagocytosis of microbial
components from the gut. We investigated the effect of inflammation on the
composition of microbiota in the ileal mucosa of CD patients in relation to the
ATG16L1 risk status.
DESIGN: Biopsies (n=35) were obtained from inflamed and non-inflamed regions of
the terminal ileum of 11 CD patients homozygous for the ATG16L1 risk allele
(ATG16L1-T300A) and 9 CD patients homozygous for the ATG16L1 protective allele
(ATG16L1-T300). Biopsy DNA was extracted and the bacterial composition analysed
by pyrosequencing. Intracellular survival rates of adherent-invasive Escherichia 
coli (AIEC) were analysed by determining colony forming units after exposure to
monocytes isolated from healthy volunteers homozygous for the ATG16L1 risk or
protective allele.
RESULTS: Inflamed ileal tissue from patients homozygous for the ATG16L1 risk
allele contained increased numbers of Fusobacteriaceae, whereas inflamed ileal
tissue of patients homozygous for the ATG16L1 protective allele showed decreased 
numbers of Bacteroidaceae and Enterobacteriaceae and increased Lachnospiraceae.
The ATG16L1 allele did not affect the bacterial composition in the non-inflamed
ileal tissue. Monocytes homozygous for the ATG16L1 risk allele showed impaired
killing of AIEC under inflammatory conditions compared with those homozygous for 
the ATG16L1 protective allele.
CONCLUSIONS: CD patients homozygous for the ATG16L1-T300A risk allele show
impaired clearance of pathosymbionts in ileal inflammation indicating that
ATG16L1 is essential for effective elimination of pathosymbionts upon
inflammation.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Acute cellular rejection (ACR) and infections are leading
causes of graft loss and death in intestinal transplant patients. Our aim was to 
evaluate the impact of maintenance immunosuppressive therapies on the expression 
of pro-inflammatory mediators in small bowel at ACR diagnosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed expression levels of Th1-associated genes,
IFNG, CXCL10, and CXCL11 by qPCR in 46 selected graft biopsies unequivocally
assigned to mild ACR (n = 14) or normal histopathology and clinical condition (n 
= 32) from 15 patients receiving two different immunosuppressive (IS) schemes.
Double treatment: corticosteroids and tacrolimus (n = 17) and triple treatment:
sirolimus or mycophenolate mofetil in addition to the basal therapy (n = 29).
RESULTS: IFNG, CXCL10, and CXCL11 were induced during rejection (p < 0.05; p <
0.005, and p < 0.05, respectively). However, when rejection and control groups
were classified according to immunosuppressive treatment, in the rejection group,
significant differences of IFNG, CXCL10, and CXCL11 expression (p < 0.001; p <
0.005, and 0.01, respectively) were detected, whereas no differences were
observed in the control group.
CONCLUSION: Gene expression of Th1 response mediators is higher during ACR.
Triple IS group showed significantly lower expression of pro-inflammatory Th1
mediators during mild ACR indicating that use of these markers to monitor
rejection can be affected by the IS treatment used.

Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α agents emerge as the hot spot in the last
decade for treating patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The effect of
anti-TNF-α agents is satisfactory; however, some patients fail to achieve
clinical response. Fortunately, in recent years, great efforts have been made and
multiple novel therapies have been developed in the treatment for IBD. In this
article, we aim to introduce anti-TNF-α drugs as well as other novel treatments
currently undergoing clinical trials for IBD.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a major clinical form of inflammatory bowel disease.
UC is characterized by mucosal inflammation limited to the colon, always
involving the rectum and a variable extent of the more proximal colon in a
continuous manner. Genetic variations in DNA repair genes may influence the
extent of repair functions, DNA damage, and thus the manifestations of UC. This
study thus evaluated the role of polymorphisms of the genes involved in DNA
repair mechanisms. A total of 171 patients and 213 controls were included.
Genotyping was carried out by ARMS PCR and PCR-RFLP analyses for RAD51, XRCC3 and
hMSH2 gene polymorphisms. Allelic and genotypic frequencies were computed in both
control & patient groups and data was analyzed using appropriate statistical
tests. The frequency of 'A' allele of hMSH2 in the UC group caused statistically 
significant increased risk for UC compared to controls (OR 1.64, 95% CI
1.16-2.31, p = 0.004). Similarly, the CT genotype of XRCC3 gene was predominant
in the UC group and increased the risk for UC by 1.75 fold compared to controls
(OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.15-2.67, p = 0.03), further confirming the risk of 'T' allele 
in UC. The GC genotype frequency of RAD51 gene was significantly increased (p =
0.02) in the UC group (50.3%) compared to controls (38%). The GC genotype
significantly increased the risk for UC compared to GG genotype by 1.73 fold (OR 
1.73, 95% CI 1.14-2.62, p = 0.02) confirming the strong association of 'C' allele
with UC. Among the controls, the SNP loci combination of hMSH2:XRCC3 were in
perfect linkage. The GTC and ACC haplotypes were found to be predominant in UC
than controls with a 2.28 and 2.93 fold significant increase risk of UC.

Telomere length has been associated with risk of many cancers, but results are
inconsistent. Seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated 
with mean leukocyte telomere length were either genotyped or well-imputed in
11108 case patients and 13933 control patients from Europe, Israel, the United
States and Australia, four of the seven SNPs reached a P value under .05
(two-sided). A genetic score that predicts telomere length, derived from these
seven SNPs, is strongly associated (P = 8.92x10(-9), two-sided) with melanoma
risk. This demonstrates that the previously observed association between longer
telomere length and increased melanoma risk is not attributable to confounding
via shared environmental effects (such as ultraviolet exposure) or reverse
causality. We provide the first proof that multiple germline genetic determinants
of telomere length influence cancer risk.

BACKGROUND: Perturbations of the intestinal microbiome, termed dysbiosis, are
linked to intestinal inflammation. Isolation of adherent-invasive Escherichia
coli (AIEC) from intestines of patients with Crohn's disease (CD), dogs with
granulomatous colitis, and mice with acute ileitis suggests these bacteria share 
pathoadaptive virulence factors that promote inflammation.
METHODS: To identify genes associated with AIEC, we sequenced the genomes of
phylogenetically diverse AIEC strains isolated from people with CD (4), dogs with
granulomatous colitis (2), and mice with ileitis (2) and 1 non-AIEC strain from
CD ileum and compared them with 38 genome sequences of E. coli and Shigella. We
then determined the prevalence of AIEC-associated genes in 49 E. coli strains
from patients with CD and controls and correlated genotype with invasion of
intestinal epithelial cells, persistence within macrophages, AIEC pathotype, and 
growth in standardized conditions.
RESULTS: Genes encoding propanediol utilization (pdu operon) and iron acquisition
(yersiniabactin, chu operon) were overrepresented in AIEC relative to
nonpathogenic E. coli. PduC (propanediol dehydratase) was enriched in CD-derived 
AIEC, correlated with increased cellular invasion, and persistence in vitro and
was increasingly expressed in fucose-containing media. Growth of AIEC required
iron, and the presence of chuA (heme acquisition) correlated with persistence in 
macrophages. CD-associated AIEC with lpfA 154 (long polar fimbriae) demonstrated 
increased invasion of epithelial cells and translocation across M cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide novel insights into the genetic basis of the
AIEC pathotype, supporting the concept that AIEC are equipped to exploit and
promote intestinal inflammation and reveal potential targets for intervention
against AIEC and inflammation-associated dysbiosis.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an abnormal inflammatory response within the 
gut to a trigger that has yet to be identified. The family history in many
patients, especially those with Crohn's disease, suggests a genetic
predisposition. It has been hypothesized that the abnormal inflammatory response 
is due in part to genetic alterations in the normal homeostatic processes that
regulate host interactions with the normal gut microbes. Genetic studies have
identified increasing numbers of genetic risk factors that involve a diverse
series of pathways such as receptors of innate immune response, defects in
epithelial barrier function, immune- and cytokine-related genes and genes
involved in autophagy. Studies further suggest that abnormal immune responses in 
IBD patients are directed against the intestinal microbiota, with activation of
both innate and adaptive immune responses. Indeed, studies have shown
bacterial-derived antigen as drivers of T cell immune responses. More recently,
Th17, regulatory T cells and unconventional innate-like T cells have been
implicated in the induction and regulation of intestinal inflammation. The
seminal discoveries of pathogen recognition receptors including Toll-like
receptors and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain receptors have changed
our understanding of how immune cells respond to microbes and the role this may
play in IBD pathogenesis. Understanding these mechanism will lead to new
strategies in the treatment and prevention of IBD.

BACKGROUND: Presence of cell-free-circulating DNA (fcDNA) sequences in sera of
patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) is a well-established phenomenon.
Potential roles of fcDNA in diagnosis, prognosis and therapy monitoring of
chronic inflammatory colonic disorders have already been examined, albeit its
actual biological function still remains unclear.
AIMS AND METHODS: In the present experiment, we studied the immunobiological
effects of isolated fcDNA of normal and inflammatory origin administered
intravenously to mice prior to induction of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-colitis.
In addition to evaluate the current disease and histological activity, changes of
the gene expression profile in isolated lamina propria cells upon TLR9 ligation
were assayed.
RESULTS: A single intravenous dose of fcDNA pretreatment with colitic fcDNA
exhibited beneficial response concerning the clinical and histological severity
of DSS-colitis as compared to effects of normal fcDNA. Pretreatment with colitic 
fcDNA substantially altered the expression of several TLR9-related and
inflammatory cytokine genes in a clinically favorable manner.
CONCLUSIONS: During the process of acute colitis, the subsequent inflammatory
environment presumably results in changes of fcDNA with the potential to
facilitate the downregulation of inflammation and improvement of regeneration.
Thus, preconditioning of mice with colitis-derived fcDNA via TLR9 signaling could
exert a tissue-protective effect and influence beneficially the course of
DSS-colitis. Elucidating mechanisms of immune response alterations by nucleic
acids may provide further insight into the etiology of IBD and develop the basis 
of novel immunotherapies.

Technological advances in the large scale analysis of human genetics have
generated profound insights into possible genetic contributions to chronic
diseases including the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), Crohn's disease and
ulcerative colitis. To date, 163 distinct genetic risk loci have been associated 
with either Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, with a substantial degree of
genetic overlap between these 2 conditions. Although many risk variants show a
reproducible correlation with disease, individual gene associations only affect a
subset of patients, and the functional contribution(s) of these risk variants to 
the onset of IBD is largely undetermined. Although studies in twins have
demonstrated that the development of IBD is not mediated solely by genetic risk, 
it is nevertheless important to elucidate the functional consequences of risk
variants for gene function in relevant cell types known to regulate key
physiological processes that are compromised in IBD. This article will discuss
IBD candidate genes that are known to be, or are suspected of being, involved in 
regulating the intestinal epithelial barrier and several of the physiological
processes presided over by this dynamic and versatile layer of cells. This will
include assembly and regulation of tight junctions, cell adhesion and polarity,
mucus and glycoprotein regulation, bacterial sensing, membrane transport,
epithelial differentiation, and restitution.

The RIPK2 kinase transduces signaling downstream of the intracellular
peptidoglycan sensors NOD1 and NOD2 to promote a productive inflammatory
response. However, excessive NOD2 signaling has been associated with numerous
diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), sarcoidosis and
inflammatory arthritis, making pharmacologic inhibition of RIPK2 an appealing
strategy. In this work, we report the generation, identification, and evaluation 
of novel RIPK2 specific inhibitors. These compounds potently inhibit the RIPK2
tyrosine kinase activity in in vitro biochemical assays and cellular assays, as
well as effectively reduce RIPK2-mediated effects in an in vivo peritonitis
model. In conjunction with the development of these inhibitors, we have also
defined a panel of genes whose expression is regulated by RIPK2 kinase activity. 
Such RIPK2 activation markers may serve as a useful tool for predicting settings 
likely to benefit from RIPK2 inhibition. Using these markers and the FDA-approved
RIPK2 inhibitor Gefitinib, we show that pharmacologic RIPK2 inhibition
drastically improves disease in a spontaneous model of Crohn Disease-like
ileitis. Furthermore, using novel RIPK2-specific inhibitors, we show that
cellular recruitment is inhibited in an in vivo peritonitis model. Altogether,
the data presented in this work provides a strong rationale for further
development and optimization of RIPK2-targeted pharmaceuticals and diagnostics.

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have recently revealed many genetic
associations that are shared between different diseases. We propose a method,
disPCA, for genome-wide characterization of shared and distinct risk factors
between and within disease classes. It flips the conventional GWAS paradigm by
analyzing the diseases themselves, across GWAS datasets, to explore their "shared
pathogenetics". The method applies principal component analysis (PCA) to
gene-level significance scores across all genes and across GWASs, thereby
revealing shared pathogenetics between diseases in an unsupervised fashion.
Importantly, it adjusts for potential sources of heterogeneity present between
GWAS which can confound investigation of shared disease etiology. We applied
disPCA to 31 GWASs, including autoimmune diseases, cancers, psychiatric
disorders, and neurological disorders. The leading principal components separate 
these disease classes, as well as inflammatory bowel diseases from other
autoimmune diseases. Generally, distinct diseases from the same class tend to be 
less separated, which is in line with their increased shared etiology. Enrichment
analysis of genes contributing to leading principal components revealed pathways 
that are implicated in the immune system, while also pointing to pathways that
have yet to be explored before in this context. Our results point to the
potential of disPCA in going beyond epidemiological findings of the co-occurrence
of distinct diseases, to highlighting novel genes and pathways that unsupervised 
learning suggest to be key players in the variability across diseases.

The interaction between the immune system and epithelial cells is tightly
regulated. Aberrations of this balance may result in inflammatory diseases such
as psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis. IL-22 is
produced by Th17, Th22 and Th1 cells. Putative targets for IL-22 are cells in the
skin, kidney, digestive and respiratory systems. The highest expression of IL-22 
receptor is found in the skin. IL-22 plays an important role in the pathogenesis 
of T cell-mediated inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis, inflammatory bowel
disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Recently, we found that miR-197 is down
regulated in psoriatic lesions. In the present work we show that miR-197 over
expression inhibits keratinocytes proliferation induced by IL-22 and
keratinocytes migration. In addition, we found that IL-22 activates miR-197
expression through the binding of phosphorylated STAT3 to sequences in the
putative promoter of miR-197. Finally we found that IL-22 receptor subunit
IL22RA1 is a direct target of miR-197. Hence, we identified a novel feedback loop
controlling IL-22 signaling, in which IL-22 induces miR-197, which in turn,
negatively regulates IL-22 receptor and attenuates the biological outcome of such
signaling. Regulation of this pathway may be important in inflammatory skin
disorders such a psoriasis and in wound healing.

OBJECTIVE: To use high-density genotyping to investigate the genetic associations
of acute anterior uveitis (AAU) in patients with and those without ankylosing
spondylitis (AS).
METHODS: We genotyped samples from 1,711 patients with AAU (either primary or
combined with AS), 2,339 AS patients without AAU, and 10,000 control subjects on 
an Illumina Immunochip Infinium microarray. We also used data for AS patients
from previous genome-wide association studies to investigate the AS risk locus
ANTXR2 for its putative effect in AAU. ANTXR2 expression in mouse eyes was
investigated by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction.
RESULTS: A comparison between all patients with AAU and healthy control subjects 
showed strong association over HLA-B, corresponding to the HLA-B27 tag
single-nucleotide polymorphism rs116488202. The association of 3 non-major
histocompatibility complex loci, IL23R, the intergenic region 2p15, and ERAP1,
reached genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10(-8)). Five loci harboring the
immune-related genes IL10-IL19, IL18R1-IL1R1, IL6R, the chromosome 1q32 locus
harboring KIF21B, as well as the eye-related gene EYS, were also associated,
reaching a suggestive level of significance (P < 5 × 10(-6)). Several previously 
confirmed AS associations demonstrated significant differences in effect size
between AS patients with AAU and AS patients without AAU. ANTXR2 expression
varied across eye compartments.
CONCLUSION: These findings of both novel AAU-specific associations and
associations shared with AS demonstrate overlapping but also distinct genetic
susceptibility loci for AAU and AS. The associations in IL10 and IL18R1 are
shared with inflammatory bowel disease, suggesting common etiologic pathways.

BACKGROUND: Multiple monogenetic conditions with partially overlapping phenotypes
can present with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-like intestinal inflammation.
With novel genotype-specific therapies emerging, establishing a molecular
diagnosis is becoming increasingly important.
DESIGN: We have introduced targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology
as a prospective screening tool in children with very early onset IBD (VEOIBD).
We evaluated the coverage of 40 VEOIBD genes in two separate cohorts undergoing
targeted gene panel sequencing (TGPS) (n=25) and whole exome sequencing (WES)
(n=20).
RESULTS: TGPS revealed causative mutations in four genes (IL10RA, EPCAM, TTC37
and SKIV2L) discovered unexpected phenotypes and directly influenced clinical
decision making by supporting as well as avoiding haematopoietic stem cell
transplantation. TGPS resulted in significantly higher median coverage when
compared with WES, fewer coverage deficiencies and improved variant detection
across established VEOIBD genes.
CONCLUSIONS: Excluding or confirming known VEOIBD genotypes should be considered 
early in the disease course in all cases of therapy-refractory VEOIBD, as it can 
have a direct impact on patient management. To combine both described NGS
technologies would compensate for the limitations of WES for disease-specific
application while offering the opportunity for novel gene discovery in the
research setting.

BACKGROUND: Dersalazine sodium is an inhibitor of platelet activator factor with 
potential efficacy in patients with ulcerative colitis through an alternative
mechanism of action. The study was a first proof of clinical safety and activity 
of dersalazine sodium in patients with ulcerative colitis.
METHODS: A double-blind study of randomized patients with ulcerative colitis
(Mayo score ≥ 5 and ≤ 10, including a sigmoidoscopy subscore ≥ 2) to dersalazine 
sodium 1200 mg/12 h, mesalazine 1200 mg/12 h, or placebo for 4 weeks. Mayo scores
were calculated on week 2 (partial Mayo) and week 4 (full Mayo). All patients
received open-label mesalazine for 4 additional weeks, and a final visit was done
at week 8.
RESULTS: The study included 34 patients (13 dersalazine sodium, 10 mesalazine,
and 11 placebo). Clinical remission was observed in 46.2% patients treated with
dersalazine sodium versus 12.5% in mesalazine and 10% in placebo after 4 weeks of
treatment. Colon biopsies showed significantly decreased expression of
inflammatory genes in dersalazine sodium patients. Adverse events at least
possibly related to treatment were observed in 23%, 12.5%, and 7.6% of patients
receiving dersalazine sodium, mesalazine, and placebo, respectively; no serious
adverse reactions were reported. Increased liver enzymes were reported in 2/13
patients receiving dersalazine sodium, with normal bilirubin levels; both
returned to normal values on treatment interruption.
CONCLUSIONS: Studies in wider populations are needed to confirm the clinical
activity of dersalazine sodium. Weekly measurements of liver function tests may
be necessary for early detection of adverse events.

Inflammation is a hallmark of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that involves
macrophages. Given the inverse link between selenium (Se) status and IBD-induced 
inflammation, our objective was to demonstrate that selenoproteins in macrophages
were essential to suppress proinflammatory mediators, in part, by the modulation 
of arachidonic acid metabolism. Acute colitis was induced using 4% dextran sodium
sulfate in wild-type mice maintained on Se-deficient (<0.01 ppm Se), Se-adequate 
(0.08 ppm; sodium selenite), and two supraphysiological levels in the form of
Se-supplemented (0.4 ppm; sodium selenite) and high Se (1.0 ppm; sodium selenite)
diets. Selenocysteinyl transfer RNA knockout mice (Trsp(fl/fl)LysM(Cre)) were
used to examine the role of selenoproteins in macrophages on disease progression 
and severity using histopathological evaluation, expression of proinflammatory
and anti-inflammatory genes, and modulation of PG metabolites in urine and
plasma. Whereas Se-deficient and Se-adequate mice showed increased colitis and
exhibited poor survival, Se supplementation at 0.4 and 1.0 ppm increased survival
of mice and decreased colitis-associated inflammation with an upregulation of
expression of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory genes. Metabolomic profiling 
of urine suggested increased oxidation of PGE2 at supraphysiological levels of Se
that also correlated well with Se-dependent upregulation of 15-hydroxy-PG
dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) in macrophages. Pharmacological inhibition of 15-PGDH,
lack of selenoprotein expression in macrophages, and depletion of infiltrating
macrophages indicated that macrophage-specific selenoproteins and upregulation of
15-PGDH expression were key for Se-dependent anti-inflammatory and proresolving
effects. Selenoproteins in macrophages protect mice from dextran sodium
sulfate-colitis by enhancing 15-PGDH-dependent oxidation of PGE2 to alleviate
inflammation, suggesting a therapeutic role for Se in IBD.

Active hexose correlated compound (AHCC) is a commercial extract of
Basidiomycetes fungi enriched in oligosaccharides that is used as a human
nutritional supplement for various purposes in humans. Our aim was to study the
anti-inflammatory effect of AHCC in the CD4+ CD62L(+) T cell transfer model of
colitis, considered one of the closest to the human disease. Colitis was induced 
by transfer of CD4(+) CD62L(+) T cells to recombination activating gene 1(-/-)
mice. AHCC (75 mg/d) was administered by gavage as a post-treatment. Three groups
were established: noncolitic, colitic (CD4(+) CD62L(+) transferred mice treated
with vehicle), and AHCC (colitic treated with AHCC). AHCC improved colitis, as
evidenced by a 24% lower colonic myeloperoxidase and a 21% lower alkaline
phosphatase activity. In addition, a decreased secretion of proinflammatory genes
assessed by RT-qPCR was observed, particularly TNF-α and IL-1β. Ex vivo
mesenteric lymph node cells obtained from AHCC treated mice exhibited a fully
normalized production of IL-6, IL-17, and IL-10 (p < 0.05). Also, AHCC treated
mice exhibited decreased STAT4 and IκB-α phosphorylation in splenic CD4(+) cells.
Our data provide validation of AHCC colonic anti-inflammatory activity in a
chronic, T cell driven model of inflammatory bowel disease.

Components of the prokaryotic clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic
repeats (CRISPR) loci have recently been repurposed for use in mammalian cells.
The CRISPR-associated (Cas)9 can be programmed with a single guide RNA (sgRNA) to
generate site-specific DNA breaks, but there are few known rules governing
on-target efficacy of this system. We created a pool of sgRNAs, tiling across all
possible target sites of a panel of six endogenous mouse and three endogenous
human genes and quantitatively assessed their ability to produce null alleles of 
their target gene by antibody staining and flow cytometry. We discovered sequence
features that improved activity, including a further optimization of the
protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9. The results from
1,841 sgRNAs were used to construct a predictive model of sgRNA activity to
improve sgRNA design for gene editing and genetic screens. We provide an online
tool for the design of highly active sgRNAs for any gene of interest.

In this study we aimed to screen effective biomarkers for differential diagnosis 
of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). By using the gene expression
profile dataset GSE24287 including 47 ileal CD, 27 UC and 25 non-inflammatory
bowel diseases control downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus database, we
identified the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between UC patients and
controls as well as between CD patients and controls (|log2FC(fold change)| > 1
and p < 0.05). Then Gene Ontology (GO) functional enrichment analyses were
performed for these DEGs in two groups, followed by the construction of weight
PPI (protein-protein interaction) networks. Subnets enriched for the PPIs and
differentially expressed genes were constructed based on the weight PPI networks.
The overlapping genes between the genes in the top 10 subnets with smallest p
value and the DEGs were selected as the candidate genes of disease. A total of 75
DEGs were identified in UC group and 87 ones in CD group. There were 69 and 57
specific DEGs in CD group and UC group, respectively. The DEGs in CD group were
mainly enriched in "inflammatory response" and "defense response", while the most
significantly enriched GO terms in UC group were "anion transport" and
"chemotaxis". FOS and SOCS3 were identified as candidate genes for CD and other
three genes HELB, ZBTB16 and FAM107A were candidate genes for UC. In conclusion, 
there were distinct genetic alterations between UC and CD. The candidate genes
identified in current study may be used as biomarkers for differential diagnosis 
of CD and UC.

Enterobacteria, especially Escherichia coli, are abundant in patients with
inflammatory bowel disease or colorectal cancer (CRC). However, it is unclear
whether cancer is promoted by inflammation-induced expansion of E. coli and/or
changes in expression of specific microbial genes. Here we use longitudinal (2,
12 and 20 weeks) 16S rRNA sequencing of luminal microbiota from ex-germ-free mice
to show that inflamed Il10(-/-) mice maintain a higher abundance of
Enterobacteriaceae than healthy wild-type mice. Experiments with mono-colonized
Il10(-/-) mice reveal that host inflammation is necessary for E. coli
cancer-promoting activity. RNA-sequence analysis indicates significant changes in
E. coli gene catalogue in Il10(-/-) mice, with changes mostly driven by
adaptation to the intestinal environment. Expression of specific genes present in
the tumour-promoting E. coli pks island are modulated by inflammation/CRC
development. Thus, progression of inflammation in Il10(-/-) mice supports
Enterobacteriaceae and alters a small subset of microbial genes important for
tumour development.

BACKGROUND: Over the last 2 decades, there has been an ever-expanding catalog of 
genetic variants implicated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) through
genome-wide association studies and next generation sequencing. In this article, 
we highlight the remarkable developments in understanding the genetic and
immunological basis of IBD. The main objective of the study was to perform a
systematic review of published literature detailing functional/immunological
studies in patients known to harbor genetic variations in the implicated genes.
METHODS: A panel of 71 candidate genes implicated in IBD was prioritized using 5 
network connectivity in silico methods. An electronic search using MEDLINE and
EMBASE from 1996 to February 2014 for each of the selected genes was conducted.
Only studies describing genotyped IBD cohorts with concurrent in vivo functional 
studies were included.
RESULTS: Between the reviewers, a total of 35,142 potentially eligible
publications were identified. Only 8 genes had publications meeting the inclusion
criteria. A total of 67 studies were identified across the selected genes. The
NOD2 gene had the most number with 41 studies followed by IL-10 with 11 eligible 
studies. A meta-analysis was not practical given the heterogeneity of the study
design and the number of implicated genes with diverse immunological and
physiological functions.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a clear lack of functional studies in humans to assess the 
in vivo impact of the various genetic variants implicated. A collaborative
approach merging genomics and functional studies will help to unravel the obscure
mechanisms involved in IBD.

BACKGROUND: Mucosal expression of interferon (IFN)-γ plays a pivotal role in the 
pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and IBD risk regions flank IFNG.
The conserved IFNG rs1861494 T/C introduces a new CpG methylation site, is
associated with disease severity and lack of therapeutic response in other
infectious and immune-mediated disorders, and is in linkage disequilibrium with a
ulcerative colitis (UC) disease severity region. It seems likely that
CpG-altering single nucleotide polymorphisms modify methylation and gene
expression. This study evaluated the association between rs1861494 and clinical, 
serologic, and methylation patterns in patients with IBD.
METHODS: Peripheral T cells of UC and Crohn's disease (CD) patients were
genotyped for rs1861494 and analyzed for allele-specific and IFNG promoter
methylation. Serum antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies and IFN-γ secretion 
were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and nucleoprotein complex
formation by electrophoretic mobility shift assay.
RESULTS: IFNG rs1861494 T allele carriage in patients with IBD was associated
with enhanced secretion of IFN-γ. T allele carriage was associated in UC with
high levels of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies and faster progression
to colectomy. In CD, it was associated with complicated disease involving a
stricturing/penetrating phenotype. Likewise, IFNG rs1861494 displayed
genotype-specific modulation of DNA methylation and transcription factor complex 
formation.
CONCLUSIONS: This study reports the first association of IFNG rs1861494 T allele 
with enhanced IFN-γ secretion and known IBD clinical parameters indicative of
more aggressive disease and serological markers associated with treatment
resistance to anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy in patients with IBD. These data
may be useful prognostically as predictors of early response to anti-tumor
necrosis factor therapy to identify patients with IBD for improved personalized
therapeutics.

BACKGROUND: Mucosal abnormalities are potentially important in the primary
pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC). We investigated the mucosal
transcriptomic expression profiles of biopsies from patients with UC and healthy 
controls, taken from macroscopically noninflamed tissue from the terminal ileum
and 3 colonic locations with the objective of identifying abnormal molecules that
might be involved in disease development.
METHODS: Whole-genome transcriptional analysis was performed on intestinal
biopsies taken from 24 patients with UC, 26 healthy controls, and 14 patients
with Crohn's disease. Differential gene expression analysis was performed at each
tissue location separately, and results were then meta-analyzed. Significantly,
differentially expressed genes were validated using quantitative polymerase chain
reaction. The location of gene expression within the colon was determined using
immunohistochemistry, subcellular fractionation, electron and confocal
microscopy. DNA methylation was quantified by pyrosequencing.
RESULTS: Only 4 probes were abnormally expressed throughout the colon in patients
with UC with Bone morphogenetic protein/Retinoic acid Inducible Neural-specific 3
(BRINP3) being the most significantly underexpressed. Attenuated expression of
BRINP3 in UC was independent of current inflammation, unrelated to phenotype or
treatment, and remained low at rebiopsy an average of 22 months later. BRINP3 is 
localized to the brush border of the colonic epithelium and expression is
influenced by DNA methylation within its promoter.
CONCLUSIONS: Genome-wide expression analysis of noninflamed mucosal biopsies from
patients with UC identified BRINP3 as significantly underexpressed throughout the
colon in a large subset of patients with UC. Low levels of this gene could
predispose or contribute to the maintenance of the characteristic mucosal
inflammation seen in this condition.

NOD2 encodes an intracellular multidomain pattern recognition receptor that is
the strongest known genetic risk factor in the pathogenesis of Crohn disease
(CD), a chronic relapsing inflammatory disorder of the intestinal tract. NOD2
functions as a sensor for bacterial cell wall components and activates
proinflammatory and antimicrobial signaling pathways. Here, using a genome-wide
small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen, we identify numerous genes that regulate
secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-8 in response to NOD2 activation.
Moreover, many of the identified IL-8 regulators are linked by protein-protein
interactions, revealing subnetworks of highly connected IL-8 regulators
implicated in processes such as vesicle formation, mRNA stability, and protein
ubiquitination and trafficking. A TNFα counterscreen to induce IL-8 secretion in 
an NOD2-independent manner reveals that the majority of the identified regulators
affect IL-8 secretion irrespective of the initiating stimuli. Using immortalized 
macrophages, we validate the ubiquitin protease, USP8, and the endosomal sorting 
protein, VPS28, as negative regulators of NOD2-induced cytokine secretion.
Interestingly, several genes that affect NOD2-induced IL-8 secretion are present 
in loci associated with CD risk by genome-wide association studies, supporting a 
role for the NOD2/IL-8 pathway, and not just NOD2, in the pathogenesis of CD.
Overall, this screen provides a valuable resource in the advancement of our
understanding of the genes that regulate the secretion of IL-8.

The role of vitamin D3 in inflammatory bowel diseases.

Author information: 
(1)2nd Department and Clinic of Pediatrics, Gastroenterology and Nutrition of the
Wroclaw Medical University, Poland.

Vitamin D3, combined with its nuclear receptor, regulates more than 900 genes,
which is the reason why its effect is pleiotropic. Among other effects, it
influences the immunological system. Its deficit may be one of the environmental 
factors taking part in the development of auto-immunological diseases. The
studies reveal that, among others things, inflammatory bowel diseases occur in
higher latitudes, with lower exposure to solar radiation and with decreased
production of vitamin D3 in the skin. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease
have vitamin D3 deficiency more frequently. The application of vitamin D3,
especially among adults with inflammatory bowel diseases, positively influences
bone turnover markers and mostly due to its influence on immunological processes,
vitamin D3 may be useful in the treatment of the primary health condition. It is 
necessary to determine the dosage range, as well as the optimal level of vitamin 
D3 metabolite-25OHD3, where the immunosuppressant effect is the best, with no
toxic effects. Studies of vitamin D3 analogues deprived of the hypercalcemic
influence, but with other merits of the basic substance remaining intact, are
particularly promising.

BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic diseases of the
gastrointestinal tract. Although their pathogenesis is unclear, the combination
of genetic predisposition and environmental components are believed to be the
main cause of these diseases. Recently, many variants in interleukin 23 receptor 
(IL23R) and autophagy-related 16-like 1 (ATG16L1) genes have been associated with
the disease. Our objective was to assess the frequency of ATG16L1 (T300A) and
IL23R (L310P) variants in Moroccan IBD (Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis)
patients and to evaluate a possible effect of these variants on disease's
phenotype and clinical course.
METHODS: 96 Moroccan IBD patients and 114 unrelated volunteers were genotyped for
ATG16L1 (T300A) and IL23R (L310P) variants by PCR-restriction fragment length
polymorphism.
RESULTS: This is the first report on the prevalence of ATG16L1 (T300A) and IL23R 
(L310P) variants in a Moroccan group. We found that IL23R (L310P) variant
conferred a protective effect for crohn's disease (CD) but not ulcerative colitis
(UC) patients. The presence of ATG16L1 (T300A) mutated alleles was associated
with CD type but not with disease onset. In addition, the carriage of T300A
variant alleles conferred a protective effect in UC.
CONCLUSION: Our results showed that the prevalence of ATG16L1 and IL23R variants 
was not significantly different between patients and controls. However a possible
role of ATG16L1 (T300A) on CD phenotype was suggested.

Evidence of an association between inflammation, microRNAs (miRNAs) and
tumorigenesis has emerged in recent years. Patients with inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD) are at an increased risk for colorectal cancer (CRC) development,
suggesting that inflammatory mediators play a causative role in colon
carcinogenesis. MiRNAs are small (19-22 nucleotides) non-coding RNA molecules
that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by base-pairing
to specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs), promoting their degradation or suppressing
translation. MiRNAs can act as inflammatory mediators, oncogenes or tumor
suppressors in different cellular environments. MiRNAs also serve as biomarkers
and therapeutic targets in CRC. The risk of CRC is also influenced by miRNA
polymorphisms and binding sites. Their functions as early diagnostic biomarkers
or prognostic classifiers has been demonstrated. Here, we reviewed recent
findings on miRNAs and inflammation in colon carcinogenesis and discussed the
potential for miRNAs and inflammation-related genes as biomarkers and therapeutic
targets in CRC.

Inflammation is a condition which contributes to a range of human diseases. It
involves a multitude of cell types, chemical mediators, and interactions.
Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are omega-3 (n-3)
fatty acids found in oily fish and fish oil supplements. These fatty acids are
able to partly inhibit a number of aspects of inflammation including leukocyte
chemotaxis, adhesion molecule expression and leukocyte-endothelial adhesive
interactions, production of eicosanoids like prostaglandins and leukotrienes from
the n-6 fatty acid arachidonic acid, production of inflammatory cytokines, and
T-helper 1 lymphocyte reactivity. In addition, EPA gives rise to eicosanoids that
often have lower biological potency than those produced from arachidonic acid and
EPA and DHA give rise to anti-inflammatory and inflammation resolving mediators
called resolvins, protectins and maresins. Mechanisms underlying the
anti-inflammatory actions of marine n-3 fatty acids include altered cell membrane
phospholipid fatty acid composition, disruption of lipid rafts, inhibition of
activation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B so
reducing expression of inflammatory genes, activation of the anti-inflammatory
transcription factor peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ and binding to 
the G protein coupled receptor GPR120. These mechanisms are interlinked, although
the full extent of this is not yet elucidated. Animal experiments demonstrate
benefit from marine n-3 fatty acids in models of rheumatoid arthritis (RA),
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and asthma. Clinical trials of fish oil in RA
demonstrate benefit, but clinical trials of fish oil in IBD and asthma are
inconsistent with no overall clear evidence of efficacy. This article is part of 
a Special Issue entitled "Oxygenated metabolism of PUFA: analysis and biological 
relevance".

Developing a quantitative view of how biological pathways are regulated in
response to environmental factors is central for understanding of disease
phenotypes. We present a computational framework, named Multivariate Inference of
Pathway Activity (MIPA), which quantifies degree of activity induced in a
biological pathway by computing five distinct measures from transcriptomic
profiles of its member genes. Statistical significance of inferred activity is
examined using multiple independent self-contained tests followed by a
competitive analysis. The method incorporates a new algorithm to identify a
subset of genes that may regulate the extent of activity induced in a pathway. We
present an in-depth evaluation of specificity, robustness, and reproducibility of
our method. We benchmarked MIPA's false positive rate at less than 1%. Using
transcriptomic profiles representing distinct physiological and disease states,
we illustrate applicability of our method in (i) identifying gene-gene
interactions in autophagy-dependent response to Salmonella infection, (ii)
uncovering gene-environment interactions in host response to bacterial and viral 
pathogens and (iii) identifying driver genes and processes that contribute to
wound healing and response to anti-TNFα therapy. We provide relevant experimental
validation that corroborates the accuracy and advantage of our method.

Importance of interleukin 6 in pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.

Takac B, Mihaljević S, Stefanić M, Glavas-Obrovac L, Kibel A, Samardzija M.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing ulcerative colitis (UC) and
Crohn's disease (CD), is an uncontrolled chronic inflammation of the
gastrointestinal tract caused by an interaction of diverse genes and
environmental factors. There is growing evidence that cytokine production plays
an important role in IBD. One of the key roles in signaling pathway in
development of IBD is performed by interleukin 6 (IL-6), although molecular
mechanism of this pathway is not yet fully understood. In order to assess the
clinical relevance of IL-6 serum concentration in patients with CD and UC we
performed cross-sectional, case-control study of IL-6 levels in patients' and
healthy blood donors' sera. A total of 100 CD and UC patients and 71 healthy
blood donors were investigated. Clinical activity of CD and UC was evaluated
using the Crohn's disease activity index and Truelove-Witt's criteria,
respectively. Quantitative assessment of serum IL-6 was performed with
solid-phase, enzyme-labeled, chemiluminescent sequential immunometric assay. Our 
results indicate that serum IL-6 is a clinically relevant parameter for CD and UC
that strongly correlates with inflammatory activity of disease. We confirmed and 
extended the role of cytokine production patterns for IBD presentation in
Croatian population.

Long non-coding RNAs are a new class of non-coding RNAs that are at the
crosshairs in many human diseases such as cancers, cardiovascular disorders,
inflammatory and autoimmune disease like Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and
Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). Nearly 90% of the phenotype-associated single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) lie
outside of the protein coding regions, and map to the non-coding intervals.
However, the relationship between phenotype-associated loci and the non-coding
regions including the long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) is poorly understood. Here, 
we systemically identified all annotated IBD and T1D loci-associated lncRNAs, and
mapped nominally significant GWAS/ImmunoChip SNPs for IBD and T1D within these
lncRNAs. Additionally, we identified tissue-specific cis-eQTLs, and strong
linkage disequilibrium (LD) signals associated with these SNPs. We explored
sequence and structure based attributes of these lncRNAs, and also predicted the 
structural effects of mapped SNPs within them. We also identified lncRNAs in IBD 
and T1D that are under recent positive selection. Our analysis identified
putative lncRNA secondary structure-disruptive SNPs within and in close proximity
(+/-5 kb flanking regions) of IBD and T1D loci-associated candidate genes,
suggesting that these RNA conformation-altering polymorphisms might be associated
with diseased-phenotype. Disruption of lncRNA secondary structure due to presence
of GWAS SNPs provides valuable information that could be potentially useful for
future structure-function studies on lncRNAs.

Endosplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1), endoplasmic reticulum
aminopeptidase 2 (ERAP2) and puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase (NPEPPS) are key 
zinc metallopeptidases that belong to the oxytocinase subfamily of M1
aminopeptidase family. NPEPPS catalyzes the processing of proteosome-derived
peptide repertoire followed by trimming of antigenic peptides by ERAP1 and ERAP2 
for presentation on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class I molecules. A
series of genome-wide association studies have demonstrated associations of these
aminopeptidases with a range of immune-mediated diseases such as ankylosing
spondylitis, psoriasis, Behçet's disease, inflammatory bowel disease and type I
diabetes, and significantly, genetic interaction between some aminopeptidases and
HLA Class I loci with which these diseases are strongly associated. In this
review, we highlight the current state of understanding of the genetic
associations of this class of genes, their functional role in disease, and
potential as therapeutic targets.

Defect in intestinal epithelial structure is a critical etiological factor of
several intestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease. The objective of 
this study was to evaluate the effect of grape seed extract (GSE), which contains
a mixture of polyphenols, on ileal mucosal structure and inflammation in
interleukin (IL)-10-deficient mice, a common model for studying inflammatory
bowel disease. Wild-type and IL-10-deficient mice were fed GSE at 0 or 1% (based 
on dry feed weight) for 16 weeks. GSE supplementation decreased crypt depth and
increased (P < 0.05) the ratio of villus/crypt length in the terminal ileum.
Consistently, the dietary GSE decreased (P < 0.05) proliferation and enhanced (P 
< 0.05) differentiation of epithelial cells. These changes in gut epithelium were
associated with the suppression of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of
activated B-cell (NF-κB) signaling. Furthermore, compared with WT mice, IL-10
deletion promoted beclin-1 and AMPK expression, both of which were decreased to
normal by GSE supplementation. These changes were associated with alterations in 
epithelial barrier function as indicated by reduced pore forming claudin-2
protein expression and increased barrier forming claudin-1 protein expression in 
the ileum of GSE supplemented mice. In summary, our data indicates that GSE
exerts protective effects to the ileal epithelial structure in IL-10-deficient
mice possibly through the suppression of inflammatory response.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is one of the main types of inflammatory bowel disease,
which is caused by dysregulated immune responses in genetically predisposed
individuals. Several genetic factors, including interleukin and interleukin
receptor gene polymorphisms and other inflammation-related genes play central
role in mediating and modulating the inflammation in the human body, thereby
these can be the main cause of development of the disease. It is clear these data
are very important for understanding the base of the disease, especially in terms
of clinical utility and validity, but summarized literature is exiguous for
challenge health specialist that can used in the clinical practice nowadays. This
review summarizes the current literature on inflammation-related genetic
polymorphisms which are associated with UC. We performed an electronic search of 
Pubmed Database among publications of the last 10 years, using the following
medical subject heading terms: UC, ulcerative colitis, inflammation, genes,
polymorphisms, and susceptibility.

AIM: To investigate the relationship between the methylation status in the SLIT2 
and TGFB2 promoters and colonic inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease
patients.
METHODS: We evaluated the methylation status of 2 genes (SLIT2 and TGFB2) in 226 
biopsies taken from 62 colonoscopies of 38 patients (29 ulcerative colitis and 9 
Crohn's colitis) using methylation-specific melting curve analysis. The
relationships between methylation status and clinical, biological, endoscopic and
histological activities were evaluated. Twenty-three of the 38 patients had a
second colonoscopy and were included in a longitudinal analysis. Numerical
results were given as the means ± SD of the sample and range, except when
specified. Student t analysis, U Mann Whitney and ANOVA factor were used to
compare the means. Qualitative results were based on the χ(2) test.
RESULTS: SLIT2 methylation was more frequent in samples with endoscopic activity 
than with endoscopic remission (55% vs 18%, P < 0.001). SLIT2 methylation was
also higher in samples with acute inflammation (56.5%) than in samples with
chronic (24%) or absent inflammation (15%) (P < 0.001). For TGFB2 methylation,
the correlation was only significant with endoscopic activity. Methylation was
higher in the distal colon for both genes (P < 0.001 for SLIT2 and P = 0.022 for 
TGFB2). In the multivariate analysis, only inflammation status (and not disease
duration or extension) was independently associated with SLIT2 methylation [OR = 
6.6 (95%CI: 1.65-27.36), P = 0.009]. In the longitudinal analysis, the
maintenance of endoscopic remission was protective for methylation.
CONCLUSION: Endoscopic and histological inflammation are predictive for SLIT2
methylation.

Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, known together as inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD), are severe autoimmune disorders now causing gut inflammation and
ulceration, among other symptoms, in up to 1 in 250 people worldwide. Incidence
and prevalence of IBD have been increasing dramatically over the past several
decades, although the causes for this increase are still unknown. IBD has both a 
complex genotype and a complex phenotype, and although it has received
substantial attention from the medical research community over recent years, much
of the etiology remains unexplained. Genome-wide association studies have
identified a rich genetic signature of disease risk in patients with IBD,
consisting of at least 163 genetic loci. Many of these loci contain genes
directly involved in microbial handling, indicating that the genetic architecture
of the disease has been driven by host-microbe interactions. In addition,
systematic shifts in gut microbiome structure (enterotype) and function have been
observed in patients with IBD. Furthermore, both the host genotype and enterotype
are associated with aspects of the disease phenotype, including location of the
disease. This provides strong evidence of interactions between host genotype and 
enterotype; however, there is a lack of published multi-omics data from IBD
patients, and a lack of bioinformatics tools for modeling such systems. In this
article we discuss, from a computational biologist's point of view, the potential
benefits of and the challenges involved in designing and analyzing such
multi-omics studies of IBD.

[Etiology and pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases].

[Article in Czech]

Lukáš M.

Zdenek Mařatka has been the first physician, who had brought a new information
for the Czech medical community with topic of inflammatory bowel diseases, which 
had been systematic studied for him. He had prepared an original theory - two
component hypothesis about origin of ulcerative colitis, which had been developed
and innovated by him for long time. From the international point of view, Mařatka
has had an extraordinary impact and significant contribution for recognition of
ulcerative colitis and Crohn´s disease. Despite the fact that the true origin of 
ulcerative colitis and Crohn´s disease (UC) still remain elusive, basic as well
as clinical research bring many new data on etiology and pathogenesis of this
inflammatory condition. It seems clear that IBD originate from interaction of
several intrinsic and extrinsic factors that contribute individually in a
particular patient. Among internal factors the genes play an important role,
because its influence on the mucosal immunity system and immunological response. 
Among the external factors importance are recognized the gut microbiota content, 
cigarette smoking and psychological stress.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the influence of gut microbiota on autophagy
activation in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) and to evaluate the IEC autophagy
response to different types of Bifidobacteria.
METHODS: IEC-18 cells were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) derived from
enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) O127:B8 and culture medium supernatants 
of four types of Bifidobacteria. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was
measured using an epithelial voltohmmeter. Autophagy was determined by
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I and the
persistence of both green fluorescent protein (GFP) and mCherry signals using a
tandem mCherry-GFP-LC3 construct. The expression of Atg12-Atg5-Atg16 complex was 
measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: EPEC-LPS significantly diminished the TEER of IEC compared with
untreated controls by 45-55%. This reduction was not observed after treated with 
Bifidobacteria at all time points. Bifidobacteria could initiate the activation
of autophagy in IEC, based on both the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I and TEM. There
was no difference in the influence of the four types of Bifidobacteria on the
autophagy response. Compared with Bifidobacteria, IEC reacted to EPEC-LPS much
more intensively by autophagy accumulation. More mCherry(+) LC3 autophagic puncta
and increased expressions of autophagy genes Atg5, Atg12 and Atg16 could be
detected after being treated with Bifidobacteria and EPEC-LPS.
CONCLUSIONS: Bifidobacteria initiate autophagy activation in IEC. The
Atg12-Atg5-Atg16 multimeric complex might participate in the activation of
Bifidobacteria-induced cell autophagy.

As an adaptive response to the overloading with misfolded proteins in the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER), ER stress plays critical roles in maintaining protein
homeostasis in the secretory pathway to avoid damage to the host. Such a
conserved mechanism is accomplished through three well-orchestrated pathways
known collectively as unfolded protein response (UPR). Persistent and
pathological ER stress has been implicated in a variety of diseases in metabolic,
inflammatory, and malignant conditions. Furthermore, ER stress is directly linked
with inflammation through UPR pathways, which modulate transcriptional programs
to induce the expression of inflammatory genes. Importantly, the inflammation
induced by ER stress is directly responsible for the pathogenesis of metabolic
and inflammatory diseases. In this review, we will discuss the potential
signaling pathways connecting ER stress with inflammation. We will also depict
the interplay between ER stress and inflammation in the pathogenesis of hepatic
steatosis, inflammatory bowel diseases and colitis-associated colon cancer.

The post-transcriptional regulator molecules, microRNAs, have emerged as
important biomarkers and modulators of numerous pathophysiological processes
including oncogenesis and cardiovascular diseases. Recently, a significant number
of dysregulations in microRNAs have been reported in patients suffering from
painful disorders such as complex regional pain syndrome, cystitis-induced
chronic pain and irritable bowel disorder, in both affected tissues and the
circulation. Moreover, microRNAs are known to be involved in pain processing
based on several recent findings in animal models of inflammatory and neuropathic
pain. The basis of this review was to cover and summarize available articles in
English encompassing "microRNA and pain". In animal pain models widespread
microRNA modulation is present and manifests on multiple levels i.e.: the dorsal 
root ganglia, the spinal dorsal horn and the brain. Numerous functional in vivo
studies have found that dysregulated microRNAs are involved in the
post-transcriptional modulation of genes implicated in pain generation and
maintenance. Lastly, a few animal studies have delivered promising results as to 
the possibility of applying microRNAs as therapeutics to alleviate established
pain and several clinical studies have highlighted the potential in applying
microRNAs as biomarkers in painful conditions such as complex regional pain
syndrome and fibromyalgia. This review briefly introduces the basics of
microRNAs, their biogenesis and function, and mainly focuses on the recent
advances made in understanding the role of microRNAs in relation to pain
processing and painful conditions. It also provides an overview of widely diverse
methodological approaches and results with a potential for future implications of
microRNAs in the diagnosis and treatment of pain.

Copy neutral segments with allelic homozygosity, also known as regions of
homozygosity (ROHs), are frequently identified in cases interrogated by
oligonucleotide single-nucleotide polymorphism (oligo-SNP) microarrays. Presence 
of ROHs may be because of parental relatedness, chromosomal recombination or
rearrangements and provides important clues regarding ancestral homozygosity,
consanguinity or uniparental disomy. In this study of 14 574 consecutive cases,
832 (6%) were found to harbor one or more ROHs over 10 Mb, of which 651 cases
(78%) had multiple ROHs, likely because of identity by descent (IBD), and 181
cases (22%) with ROHs involving a single chromosome. Parental relatedness was
predicted to be first degree or closer in 5%, second in 9% and third in 19%. Of
the 181 cases, 19 had ROHs for a whole chromosome revealing uniparental isodisomy
(isoUPD). In all, 25 cases had significant ROHs involving a single chromosome; 5 
cases were molecularly confirmed to have a mixed iso- and heteroUPD15 and 1 case 
each with segmental UPD9pat and segmental UPD22mat; 17 cases were suspected to
have a mixed iso- and heteroUPD including 2 cases with small supernumerary marker
and 2 cases with mosaic trisomy. For chromosome 15, 12 (92%) of 13 molecularly
studied cases had either Prader-Willi or Angelman syndrome. Autosomal recessive
disorders were confirmed in seven of nine cases from eight families because of
the finding of suspected gene within a ROH. This study demonstrates that ROHs are
much more frequent than previously recognized and often reflect parental
relatedness, ascertain autosomal recessive diseases or unravel UPD in many cases.

BACKGROUND: In contrast to anti-TNF-α antibodies, anti-IL-17A antibodies lacked
clinical efficacy in a trial with patients suffering from Crohn's disease. We
therefore analyzed how IL-17A modulates the inflammatory response elicited by
TNF-α in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC).
METHODS: Target mRNA levels in IEC and colonic biopsies were assessed by RNA
microarray and quantitative real-time PCR. Signaling pathways were analyzed using
receptor neutralization and pharmacological inhibitors. Target protein levels
were determined by immunoblotting.
RESULTS: Microarray analysis demonstrated that IL-17A alone is a weak inducer of 
gene expression in IEC (29 regulated transcripts), but significantly affected the
TNF-α-induced expression of 547 genes, with strong amplification of
proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines (>200-fold increase of CCL20, CXCL1, and
CXCL8). Interestingly, IL-17A differentially modulated the TNF-α-induced
expression of several inflammatory bowel disease susceptibility genes in IEC
(increase of JAK2 mRNA, decrease of FUT2, ICAM1, and LTB mRNA). Negative
regulation of ICAM-1 by IL-17A was verified on protein level. The significance of
these findings is emphasized by inflamed lesions of patients with inflammatory
bowel disease demonstrating significant correlations (P < 0.01, Rho, 0.57-0.85)
for JAK2, ICAM1, and LTB mRNA with IL17A and TNF mRNA.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the modulation of inflammatory bowel disease 
susceptibility gene mRNA in IEC as a novel important property of IL-17A. Given
the weak impact of sole IL-17A stimulation on IEC target gene expression, our
study provides an important explanation for the lack of clinical efficacy of sole
IL-17A neutralization, but suggests a beneficial effect of combined IL-17A/TNF-α 
that is currently in clinical development.

BACKGROUND: Although numerous investigations have compared gene expression
microarray platforms, preprocessing methods and batch correction algorithms using
constructed spike-in or dilution datasets, there remains a paucity of studies
examining the properties of microarray data using diverse biological samples.
Most microarray experiments seek to identify subtle differences between samples
with variable background noise, a scenario poorly represented by constructed
datasets. Thus, microarray users lack important information regarding the
complexities introduced in real-world experimental settings. The recent
development of a multiplexed, digital technology for nucleic acid measurement
enables counting of individual RNA molecules without amplification and, for the
first time, permits such a study.
RESULTS: Using a set of human leukocyte subset RNA samples, we compared
previously acquired microarray expression values with RNA molecule counts
determined by the nCounter Analysis System (NanoString Technologies) in selected 
genes. We found that gene measurements across samples correlated well between the
two platforms, particularly for high-variance genes, while genes deemed
unexpressed by the nCounter generally had both low expression and low variance on
the microarray. Confirming previous findings from spike-in and dilution datasets,
this "gold-standard" comparison demonstrated signal compression that varied
dramatically by expression level and, to a lesser extent, by dataset. Most
importantly, examination of three different cell types revealed that noise levels
differed across tissues.
CONCLUSIONS: Microarray measurements generally correlate with relative RNA
molecule counts within optimal ranges but suffer from expression-dependent
accuracy bias and precision that varies across datasets. We urge microarray users
to consider expression-level effects in signal interpretation and to evaluate
noise properties in each dataset independently.

PURPOSE: Appendicitis and appendectomy(AA), when done at a young age, offer
protection against inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) development in later life.
However, IBD pathogenesis involves both immunological and vascular abnormalities.
Using the first murine model of AA (developed by us), we aimed to determine the
role of AA in modulating vascular remodelling mediated by endothelin activity in 
IBD.
METHODS: Mice with two laparotomies each served as controls (sham-sham or SS).
Distal colons were harvested (four AA group colons, four SS group colons), and
RNA extracted from each. The RNA was subjected to microarray analysis and RT-PCR 
validation. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) software was used to further
analyze the microarray data.
RESULTS: Gene expression of seven genes closely associated with endothelin
activity was examined in distal colons 3 days post-AA and 28 days post-AA. While 
there were no gene expression changes 3 days post-AA, the genes EDN1 (0.7-fold), 
EDN2 (0.8-fold) and ECE2 (0.8-fold) were downregulated (*p value <0.05) 28 days
post-AA. However, EDN3 (1.3-fold) was upregulated 28 days post-AA (*p value
<0.05). GSEA analysis showed downregulation of 11 gene sets (stringent
cut-offs-false discovery rate <5 % and p value <0.001) associated with endothelin
and endothelin-converting enzyme genes by AA, in contrast to only 1 being
upregulated.
CONCLUSIONS: AA induces a delayed but significant suppression of genes pertaining
to endothelin activity. Elucidating the pathways involved in suppression of
endothelin activity and manipulation of different genes/enzymes/proteins related 
to endothelin activity will significantly enhance the extant repertoire of
therapeutic options in IBD.

Multiple studies have demonstrated alterations in the intestinal microbial
community (termed the microbiome) in Crohn's disease (CD) and several lines of
evidence suggest these changes may have a significant role in disease
pathogenesis. In active and quiescent disease, both the faecal and
mucosa-associated microbiome are discordant with matched controls with reduced
biodiversity, changes in dominant organisms and increased temporal variation
described. Mucosa-associated adherent, invasive Escherichia coli (E. coli)
(AIEC), pro-inflammatory and resistant to killing by mucosal macrophages, appear 
to be particularly important. AIEC possess several virulence factors which may
confer pathogenic potential in CD. Type-1 pili (FimH) allow adherence to
intestinal cells via cell-surface carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion 
molecules and possession of long polar fimbrae promotes translocation across the 
intestinal mucosa via microfold (M)-cells of the follicle-associated epithelium. 
Resistance to stress genes (htrA, dsbA and hfq) and tolerance of an acidic pH may
contribute to survival within the phagolysosomal environment. Here we review the 
current understanding of the role of mucosa-associated E. coli in Crohn's
pathogenesis, the role of the innate immune system, factors which may contribute 
to prolonged bacterial survival and therapeutic strategies to target
intracellular E. coli.

OBJECTIVE: Vitamin D and the vitamin D receptor (VDR) appear to be important
immunological regulators of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Defective
autophagy has also been implicated in IBD, where interestingly, polymorphisms of 
genes such as ATG16L1 have been associated with increased risk. Although vitamin 
D, the microbiome and autophagy are all involved in pathogenesis of IBD, it
remains unclear whether these processes are related or function independently.
DESIGN: We investigated the effects and mechanisms of intestinal epithelial VDR
in healthy and inflamed states using cell culture models, a conditional VDR
knockout mouse model (VDR(ΔIEC)), colitis models and human samples.
RESULTS: Absence of intestinal epithelial VDR affects microbial assemblage and
increases susceptibility to dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis. Intestinal
epithelial VDR downregulates expressions of ATG16L1 and lysozyme, and impairs
antimicrobial function of Paneth cells. Gain and loss-of-function assays showed
that VDR levels regulate ATG16L1 and lysozyme at the transcriptional and
translational levels. Moreover, low levels of intestinal epithelial VDR
correlated with reduced ATG16L1 and representation by intestinal Bacteroides in
patients with IBD. Administration of the butyrate (a fermentation product of gut 
microbes) increases intestinal VDR expression and suppresses inflammation in a
colitis model.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates fundamental relationship between VDR,
autophagy and gut microbial assemblage that is essential for maintaining
intestinal homeostasis, but also in contributing to the pathophysiology of IBD.
These insights can be leveraged to define therapeutic targets for restoring VDR
expression and function.

Liver cirrhosis occurs as a consequence of many chronic liver diseases that are
prevalent worldwide. Here we characterize the gut microbiome in liver cirrhosis
by comparing 98 patients and 83 healthy control individuals. We build a reference
gene set for the cohort containing 2.69 million genes, 36.1% of which are novel. 
Quantitative metagenomics reveals 75,245 genes that differ in abundance between
the patients and healthy individuals (false discovery rate < 0.0001) and can be
grouped into 66 clusters representing cognate bacterial species; 28 are enriched 
in patients and 38 in control individuals. Most (54%) of the patient-enriched,
taxonomically assigned species are of buccal origin, suggesting an invasion of
the gut from the mouth in liver cirrhosis. Biomarkers specific to liver cirrhosis
at gene and function levels are revealed by a comparison with those for type 2
diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease. On the basis of only 15 biomarkers, a
highly accurate patient discrimination index is created and validated on an
independent cohort. Thus microbiota-targeted biomarkers may be a powerful tool
for diagnosis of different diseases.

OBJECTIVE: Progression from ulcerative colitis (UC) toward colorectal carcinoma
(CRC) is multistep process that includes gene alterations of tumor suppressor
genes, such as p53 and p16. The aim of this study was to investigate the
expression patterns of p16, p53 and VEGF in affected tissue and serum levels of
cytokines TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-17 in patients with UC and CRC, 
respectively. MATHERIALS AND METHODS. Serum levels of cytokine in patients with
UC (n=24) and CRC (n=75) and in a healthy group (n=37) were analyzed by ELISA.
Endoscopic biopsies specimens of UC and CRC were studied by immunohistochemical
staining for p16, p53 and VEGF.
RESULTS: Patients with UC with presence of extraintestinal manifestations,
complications, and positive staining of p16, p53 and VEGF respectively had higher
serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Higher percentage of CRC patients had
positive staining of p16, p53 and VEGF. CRC patients with positive staining of
VEGF had decreased systemic values of pro-inflammatory IFN-γ and increased values
of immunosuppressive IL-10.
CONCLUSIONS: Relatively low IL-10 in patients with severe UC is insufficient to
compensate IL-6 secretion and subsequently enhanced type 1/17 immune response. In
UC patients, p16 and p53 induce enhanced VEGF expression and subsequent
production of pro-inflammatory TNF-α and IL-6. In CRC patients VEGF seems to have
immunosuppressive role. It appears that tumor suppressor gene-VEGF axis have dual
role on immune response in inflammation of UC and tumor growth and progression of
CRC.

BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; including ulcerative colitis and
Crohn's disease) is associated with an increased risk for colorectal cancer
(CRC). Chronic mucosal inflammation is a key factor in the onset of
carcinogenesis in IBD patients. Although most gene alterations that cause
sporadic CRCs also occur in patients with IBD-associated CRC, some gene sequences
and mutation frequencies differ between sporadic CRCs and IBD-associated CRCs.
SUMMARY: This review explores the incidence of CRC in IBD patients, with the goal
of identifying the risk and protective factors for CRC in order to facilitate
dysplasia management via individualized surveillance strategies.
KEY MESSAGE: The incidence of CRC is higher among IBD patients. Identifying the
risk and protective factors for CRC will facilitate dysplasia management via
individualized surveillance strategies.
PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Several risk factors, including active inflammation, the 
coexistence of primary sclerosing cholangitis, a family history of sporadic CRC
and the extent and duration of colonic disease, can lead to the development of
CRC in patients with IBD. These risk factors should be utilized in individualized
surveillance strategies to lower CRC incidence among IBD patients. Use of
5-aminosalicylic acid may play an important role in CRC prevention. Until newer, 
more reliable markers of IBD-associated CRC risk are found, dysplasia will
continue to be the best marker of CRC risk in IBD. Dysplasia management continues
to play a key role in preventing the progression of carcinogenesis.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn's disease (CD) and
ulcerative colitis (UC), is a chronic disorder that affects thousands of people
around the world. These diseases are characterized by exacerbated uncontrolled
intestinal inflammation that leads to poor quality of life in affected patients. 
Although the exact cause of IBD still remains unknown, compelling evidence
suggests that the interplay among immune deregulation, environmental factors, and
genetic polymorphisms contributes to the multifactorial nature of the disease.
Therefore, in this review we present classical and novel findings regarding IBD
etiopathogenesis. Considering the genetic causes of the diseases, alterations in 
about 100 genes or allelic variants, most of them in components of the immune
system, have been related to IBD susceptibility. Dysbiosis of the intestinal
microbiota also plays a role in the initiation or perpetuation of gut
inflammation, which develops under altered or impaired immune responses. In this 
context, unbalanced innate and especially adaptive immunity has been considered
one of the major contributing factors to IBD development, with the involvement of
the Th1, Th2, and Th17 effector population in addition to impaired regulatory
responses in CD or UC. Finally, an understanding of the interplay among
pathogenic triggers of IBD will improve knowledge about the immunological
mechanisms of gut inflammation, thus providing novel tools for IBD control.

Nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain NOD-like receptors (NLRs) are
highly conserved cytosolic pattern recognition receptors that play, in
combination with toll-like receptors, a critical role in innate immunity and
inflammation. These proteins are characterized by a central oligomerization
domain termed nucleotide-binding domain, and a protein interaction domain
containing leucine-rich repeats. Some NLRs, including NOD1 and NOD2, sense the
cytosolic presence of conserved bacterial molecular signatures and drive the
activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and the transcription factor
NF-κB. A different set of NLRs induces caspase-1 activation through the assembly 
of large protein complexes known as inflammasomes. Activation of NLR proteins
results in secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and subsequent inflammatory
responses. The critical role of NLRs in innate immunity is underscored by the
fact that polymorphisms within their genes are implicated in the development of
several immune-mediated diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease. Over the 
past few years, the role of NLRs in intestinal homeostasis has been highlighted, 
however the mechanism by which dysfunction in these proteins leads to aberrant
inflammation is still the focus of much investigation. The purpose of this review
is to systematically evaluate the function of NLRs in mucosal innate immunity and
understand how genetic or functional alterations in these components can lead to 
the disruption of intestinal homeostasis, and the subsequent development of
chronic inflammation.

Vitamin D in inflammatory diseases.

Germany.

Changes in vitamin D serum levels have been associated with inflammatory
diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rheumatoid arthritis,
systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis (MS), atherosclerosis, or
asthma. Genome- and transcriptome-wide studies indicate that vitamin D signaling 
modulates many inflammatory responses on several levels. This includes (i) the
regulation of the expression of genes which generate pro-inflammatory mediators, 
such as cyclooxygenases or 5-lipoxygenase, (ii) the interference with
transcription factors, such as NF-κB, which regulate the expression of
inflammatory genes and (iii) the activation of signaling cascades, such as MAP
kinases which mediate inflammatory responses. Vitamin D targets various tissues
and cell types, a number of which belong to the immune system, such as
monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs) as well as B- and T cells, leading
to individual responses of each cell type. One hallmark of these specific vitamin
D effects is the cell-type specific regulation of genes involved in the
regulation of inflammatory processes and the interplay between vitamin D
signaling and other signaling cascades involved in inflammation. An important
task in the near future will be the elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms that
are involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses by vitamin D on the
molecular level by the use of techniques such as chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP), ChIP-seq, and FAIRE-seq.

Lactoferrin (Lf) is an iron-binding glycoprotein that is produced by mucosal
epithelial cells in mammals. Lf has non-immune natural defense functions and
biological functions in addition to and distinct from its role in regulating
inflammatory responses. Lf also improved some physiological and immunological
parameters. Lf is a biomarker for monitoring medical treatment in inflammatory
bowel diseases. Current LF research focuses on iron absorption, antimicrobial
activity, and the modulation of iron metabolism during inflammation. No
systematic research about Lf expression levels in mouse mammary glands during
pregnancy and lactation exists. We investigated Lf mRNA expression levels in
mouse mammary glands by collecting samples on days 1, 6, 12, and 18 of pregnancy 
and lactation (six mice per group). The expression levels of Lf mRNA were
measured by semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
using GAPDH as an internal control. Lf mRNA was not expressed in mammary glands
on days 1, 6, and 12 of pregnancy, but it was expressed on day 18 (IOD:
integrated optical density; Lf(IOD)/GAPDH(IOD) = 0.46). Lf expression levels were
higher during lactation stages than during pregnancy stages, and it stabilized at
0.71-0.73 (Lf(IOD)/GAPDH(IOD)) from day 1 to 12 of lactation; however, the
difference was not significant (P > 0.05). At day 18 of lactation, Lf expression 
began to decline (Lf(IOD)/GAPDH(IOD) = 0.61), but the difference was not
significant (P > 0.05). Based on these results, the variation in Lf expression
levels during developmental stages may be related to its regulatory role in mouse
mammary gland immunity.

Effective therapies are limited for patients with parenteral nutrition-dependent 
short bowel syndrome. We previously showed that intestinal expression of the
transcriptional coregulator tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate-induced sequence 7
(tis7) is markedly increased during the adaptive response following massive small
bowel resection and tis7 plays a role in normal gut lipid metabolism. Here, we
further explore the functional implications of tis7 deletion in intestinal lipid 
metabolism and the adaptive response following small bowel resection. Intestinal 
tis7 transgenic (tis7(tg)), tis7(-/-), and wild-type (WT) littermates were
subjected to 50% small bowel resection. Mice were fed a control or a
high-saturated-fat (42% energy) diet for 21 days. Survival, body weight recovery,
lipid absorption, mucosal lipid analysis, and the morphometric adaptive response 
were analyzed. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to identify tis7
downstream gene targets. Postresection survival was markedly reduced in high-fat,
but not control, diet-fed tis7(-/-) mice. Decreased survival was associated with 
anastomotic inflammation and intestinal obstruction postresection. High-fat, but 
not control, diet-fed tis7(-/-) mice had increased intestinal IL-6 expression.
Intestinal lipid trafficking was altered in tis7(-/-) compared with WT mice
postresection. In contrast, high-fat diet-fed tis7(tg) mice had improved survival
postresection compared with WT littermates. High-fat diet feeding in the setting 
of tis7 deletion resulted in postresection anastomotic inflammation and small
bowel obstruction. Tolerance of a calorie-rich, high-fat diet postresection may
require tis7 and its target genes. The presence of luminal fat in the setting of 
tis7 deletion promotes an intestinal inflammatory response postresection.

Patients with a diverse spectrum of rare genetic disorders can present with
inflammatory bowel disease (monogenic IBD). Patients with these disorders often
develop symptoms during infancy or early childhood, along with endoscopic or
histological features of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or IBD
unclassified. Defects in interleukin-10 signaling have a Mendelian inheritance
pattern with complete penetrance of intestinal inflammation. Several genetic
defects that disturb intestinal epithelial barrier function or affect innate and 
adaptive immune function have incomplete penetrance of the IBD-like phenotype.
Several of these monogenic conditions do not respond to conventional therapy and 
are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Due to the broad spectrum of
these extremely rare diseases, a correct diagnosis is frequently a challenge and 
often delayed. In many cases, these diseases cannot be categorized based on
standard histological and immunologic features of IBD. Genetic analysis is
required to identify the cause of the disorder and offer the patient appropriate 
treatment options, which include medical therapy, surgery, or allogeneic
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In addition, diagnosis based on genetic 
analysis can lead to genetic counseling for family members of patients. We
describe key intestinal, extraintestinal, and laboratory features of 50 genetic
variants associated with IBD-like intestinal inflammation. In addition, we
provide approaches for identifying patients likely to have these disorders. We
also discuss classic approaches to identify these variants in patients, starting 
with phenotypic and functional assessments that lead to analysis of candidate
genes. As a complementary approach, we discuss parallel genetic screening using
next-generation sequencing followed by functional confirmation of genetic
defects.

The gut immune system is complex, and dysregulation leads to a number of
disorders including inflammatory bowel syndrome and (in livestock) Johne's
disease. Previous work has demonstrated that males and females respond
differently to treatment with pathologic and probiotic microorganisms, suggesting
that a 'one-size-fits-all' approach to treat GIT inflammation may be inadequate. 
While we had observed significant differences between males and females in terms 
of cytokine production, it remains unclear how these changes occur. To better
understand the mechanisms, transcript expression of genes important to gut
immunoregulation were monitored from male and female BALB/c mice consuming the
probiotic Lactobacillus animalis (1 × 10(6) CFU g(-1) ) and infected with the gut
pathogen, Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (1 × 10(7) CFU).
Expression of transcripts analyzed included those important to the immune system,
intestinal cell differentiation, and/or regulation. Males generally displayed
increased expression of Th 2 and B-cell mediators, and females showed repressed
cytokine expression after MAP infection (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1 among others).
Additionally, regulation of pro-inflammatory mediators in female mice consuming
probiotics suggests females responded positively to L. animalis when compared to 
males. Therefore, we speculate that studying mechanistic changes associated with 
sex and immunoregulation in gastrointestinal tissues could further elucidate host
response to microorganisms.

BACKGROUND: Accurate and reproducible measurement of expression of
pro-inflammatory cytokines in colonic biopsies from patients with ulcerative
colitis (UC) is essential for proof-of-concept and mechanism-of-action studies.
Few studies have rigorously established the number of biopsies required for
accurate and reproducible biomarker measurements.
AIM: To validate methods for measuring changes in gene expression in colonic
biopsy samples.
METHODS: Twelve colonic biopsies were obtained from each of six healthy controls,
six patients with inactive UC and seven patients with active UC. Mayo endoscopic 
scores were used as a clinical reference standard. Quantitative PCR was used to
assess mRNA expression of eight known inflammatory genes. The power to detect a
reduction in gene expression in active vs. inactive UC was calculated using a
linear mixed effect model.
RESULTS: mRNA analysis of colonic biopsies is a sensitive and feasible approach
for measuring inflammatory gene expression in colonic biopsies. Inflammatory
biomarkers correlate with Mayo endoscopic subscores for each colonic region. For 
most genes, three rectal biopsies from two to four patients are required to
detect changes in gene expression corresponding to active vs. inactive UC to
achieve a power of 80% with an alpha of 0.05.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that systematic measurement of inflammatory
biomarkers at the mRNA level can be a valuable tool for hypothesis testing, and
assessment of clinical activity and response to therapy in ulcerative colitis.

The most important genetic associations that have been implicated to play a role 
in the etiology of Crohn's disease (CD) in humans are single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in nucleotide oligomerisation domain 2 (NOD2). The aim of
this study was to investigate whether SNPs in the canine NOD2 gene are associated
with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in German shepherd dogs (GSDs) and other
canine breeds. A mutational analysis of the NOD2 gene was carried out in 10
randomly selected GSDs with IBD. The mutational analysis identified five
non-synonymous SNPS, of which four in exon 3 of the NOD2 gene were evaluated in a
case-control study using sequence based typing. Sequencing information from 55
GSDs with IBD were compared to a control group consisting of 61 GSDs. In
addition, 85 dogs of other breeds with IBD and a breed-matched control group
consisting of 162 dogs were also genotyped. All four SNPs were in complete
linkage and, in the GSD population, were found to be in Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium. When the GSD case population was compared to the GSD control group, 
the heterozygote genotype for all four SNPs was more frequently found in the IBD 
population (p=0.03, OR=2.30, CI=1.07-4.94). However, these results were not
mirrored in other canine breeds. Our study suggests that the four SNPs in exon 3 
of NOD2 are significantly associated with IBD in GSDs when analyzed in an
over-dominant model. However, these results were not mirrored in other canine
breeds with IBD. This suggests that the etiology of this disease is complex and
may involve the interaction of SNPs present in several genes or pathways to bring
about the inflammatory changes seen in the intestine.

BACKGROUND: High-throughput measurement technologies such as microarrays provide 
complex datasets reflecting mechanisms perturbed in an experiment, typically a
treatment vs. control design. Analysis of these information rich data can be
guided based on a priori knowledge, such as networks or set of related proteins
or genes. Among those, cause-and-effect network models are becoming increasingly 
popular and more than eighty such models, describing processes involved in cell
proliferation, cell fate, cell stress, and inflammation have already been
published. A meaningful systems toxicology approach to study the response of a
cell system, or organism, exposed to bio-active substances requires a
quantitative measure of dose-response at network level, to go beyond the
differential expression of single genes.
RESULTS: We developed a method that quantifies network response in an
interpretable manner. It fully exploits the (signed graph) structure of
cause-and-effect networks models to integrate and mine transcriptomics
measurements. The presented approach also enables the extraction of network-based
signatures for predicting a phenotype of interest. The obtained signatures are
coherent with the underlying network perturbation and can lead to more robust
predictions across independent studies. The value of the various components of
our mathematically coherent approach is substantiated using several in vivo and
in vitro transcriptomics datasets. As a proof-of-principle, our methodology was
applied to unravel mechanisms related to the efficacy of a specific
anti-inflammatory drug in patients suffering from ulcerative colitis. A plausible
mechanistic explanation of the unequal efficacy of the drug is provided.
Moreover, by utilizing the underlying mechanisms, an accurate and robust
network-based diagnosis was built to predict the response to the treatment.
CONCLUSION: The presented framework efficiently integrates transcriptomics data
and "cause and effect" network models to enable a mathematically coherent
framework from quantitative impact assessment and data interpretation to patient 
stratification for diagnosis purposes.

Regular consumption of moderate doses of wine is an integral part of the
Mediterranean diet, which has long been considered to provide remarkable health
benefits. Wine's beneficial effect has been attributed principally to its
non-alcoholic portion, which has antioxidant properties, and contains a wide
variety of phenolics, generally called polyphenols. Wine phenolics may prevent or
delay the progression of intestinal diseases characterized by oxidative stress
and inflammation, especially because they reach higher concentrations in the gut 
than in other tissues. They act as both free radical scavengers and modulators of
specific inflammation-related genes involved in cellular redox signaling. In
addition, the importance of wine polyphenols has recently been stressed for their
ability to act as prebiotics and antimicrobial agents. Wine components have been 
proposed as an alternative natural approach to prevent or treat inflammatory
bowel diseases. The difficulty remains to distinguish whether these positive
properties are due only to polyphenols in wine or also to the alcohol intake,
since many studies have reported ethanol to possess various beneficial effects.
Our knowledge of the use of wine components in managing human intestinal
inflammatory diseases is still quite limited, and further clinical studies may
afford more solid evidence of their beneficial effects.

Recent clinical trials in patients with inflammatory diseases like multiple
sclerosis (MS) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have shown the beneficial
effects of probiotic helminth administration, although the underlying mechanism
of action remains largely unknown. Potential cellular targets may include innate 
immune cells that propagate inflammation in these diseases, like pro-inflammatory
macrophages. We here investigated the effects of the helminth Trichuris suis
soluble products (SPs) on the phenotype and function of human inflammatory
(granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-differentiated)
macrophages. Interestingly, we here show that T. suis SPs potently skew
inflammatory macrophages into a more anti-inflammatory state in a Toll-like
receptor 4 (TLR4)-dependent manner, and less effects are seen when stimulating
macrophages with TLR2 or -3 ligands. Gene microarray analysis of
GM-CSF-differentiated macrophages further revealed that many TLR4-induced
inflammatory mediators, including interleukin (IL)-12B, CCL1 and CXCL9, are
downregulated by T. suis SPs. In particular, we observed a strong reduction in
the expression and function of P2RX7, a purinergic receptor involved in
macrophage inflammation, leading to reduced IL-1β secretion. In conclusion, we
show that T. suis SPs suppress a broad range of inflammatory pathways in
GM-CSF-differentiated macrophages in a TLR4-dependent manner, thereby providing
enhanced mechanistic insight into the therapeutic potential of this helminth for 
patients with inflammatory diseases.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammation of the digestive
tract, characterized by dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota. Probiotics have
been suggested as a strategy to reduce active disease or extend remission. We
isolated and characterized the butyrate-producing strain Butyricicoccus
pullicaecorum 25-3(T) and identified it as a potential probiotic for patients
with IBD. To evaluate the safety of 25-3(T) for use in humans, we conducted a
standard acute oral toxicity test and a 28-day repeated oral dose toxicity test. 
The complete genome of B. pullicaecorum 25-3(T) was sequenced to search for
virulence factors and antibiotic resistance determinants. The minimum inhibitory 
concentration (MIC) of 21 antimicrobials was determined. Results showed no
adverse effects in the oral toxicity tests. B. pullicaecorum 25-3(T) is resistant
against aminoglycosides and trimethoprim. The genome of 25-3(T) contains no
virulence factors, one gene related to harmful metabolites and 52 sequences with 
high similarity to antimicrobial and toxic compound resistance genes, that did
not correspond with a resistant phenotype. This first report of a safety
assessment of a butyrate-producing strain from Clostridium cluster IV shows that 
B. pullicaecorum 25-3(T) is a non-pathogenic strain, but carries antibiotic
resistance genes with the risk of transfer, that need further investigation.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Despite the mortality associated with liver disease observed
in patients with short bowel syndrome (SBS), mechanisms underlying the
development of SBS-associated liver disease (SBS-ALD) are poorly understood. This
study examines the impact of bacterially-mediated bile acid (BA) dysmetabolism on
farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signalling pathways and clinical outcome in a piglet
model of SBS-ALD.
METHODS: 4-week old piglets underwent 75% small bowel resection (SBR) or sham
operation. Liver histology and hepatic inflammatory gene expression were
examined. Abundance of BA biotransforming bacteria was determined and metabolomic
studies detailed the alterations in BA composition of stool, portal serum and
bile samples. Gene expression of intestinal and hepatic FXR target genes and
small heterodimer partner (SHP) transrepression targets were assessed.
RESULTS: Histological evidence of SBS-ALD included liver bile duct proliferation,
hepatocyte ballooning and fibrosis. Inflammatory gene expression was increased.
Microbiota changes included a 10-fold decrease in Clostridium and a two-fold
decrease in Bacteroides in SBS-ALD piglets. BA composition was altered and
reflected a primary BA dominant composition. Intestinal and hepatic regulation of
BA synthesis was characterised by a blunted intestinal FXR activation response
and a failure of SHP to repress key hepatic targets.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose a pathological scenario in which microbial dysbiosis
following SBR results in significant BA dysmetabolism and consequent outcomes
including steatorrhoea, persistent diarrhoea and liver damage. Furthermore
alterations in BA composition may have contributed to the observed disturbance in
FXR-mediated signalling pathways. These findings provide an insight into the
complex mechanisms mediating the development of liver disease in patients with
SBS.

BACKGROUND: The tight junction protein Claudin-1, a claudin family member, has
been implicated in several gastro-intestinal pathologies including inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC). In this regard, we have
demonstrated that claudin-1 expression in colon cancer cells potentiates their
tumorigenic ability while in vivo expression of claudin-1 in the intestinal
epithelial cells (IECs) promotes Notch-activation, inhibits goblet cell
differentiation and renders susceptibility to mucosal inflammation. Notably, a
key role of inflammation in colon cancer progression is being appreciated.
Therefore, we examined whether inflammation plays an important role in
claudin-1-dependent upregulation of colon carcinogenesis.
METHODS: APCmin mice were crossed with Villin-claudin-1 transgenic mice to
generate APC-Cldn1 mice. H&E stained colon tissues were assessed for tumor
number, size and histological grade. Additionally, microarray and qPCR analyses
of colonic tumors were performed to assess molecular changes due to claudin-1
expression. APC-Cldn1 and APCmin controls were assessed for colonic permeability 
via rectal administration of FITC-dextran, and bacterial translocation via qPCR
analysis of 16S rDNA.
RESULTS: Claudin-1 overexpression in APCmin mice significantly increased
(~4-fold) colonic tumor growth and size, and decreased survival. Furthermore,
transcriptome analysis supported upregulated proliferation, and increased Wnt and
Notch-signaling in APC-Cldn1 mice. APC-Cldn1 mice also demonstrated inhibition of
mucosal defense genes while expression of pro-inflammatory genes was sharply
upregulated, especially the IL-23/IL-17 signaling. We predict that increased
Notch/Wnt-signaling underlie the early onset of adenoma formation in APC-Cldn1
mice. An increase in mucosal permeability due to the adenomas and the inherent
barrier defect in these mice further facilitate bacterial translocation into the 
mucosa to induce inflammation, which in turn promote the tumorigenesis.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results confirm the role of claudin-1 as a
promoter of colon tumorigenesis and further identify the role of the dysregulated
antigen-tumor interaction and inflammation in claudin-1-dependent upregulation of
colon tumorigenesis.

Inflammatory bowel disease is a chronic colonic inflammation that displays
symptoms like diarrhea and weight loss. Acupuncture has been widely accepted by
Western countries for the treatment of pain. Here, we analyzed efficacy and
mechanism of electroacupuncture (EA) on trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid- (TNBS-)
induced colitis in mice. Mice were intrarectally administered with 250 mg/kg TNBS
and electroacupunctured at Quze (PC3) and Neiguan (PC6) acupoints, which have
been applied for gastrointestinal disorders. Gene expression profiles in colons
and spleens were analyzed by microarray for the elucidation of mechanism of EA.
Our data showed that EA at PC3 and PC6 improved macroscopic and microscopic
features of colitis and the improvement displayed a frequency-dependent manner.
Administration of TNBS upregulated the expression of most cytokine genes in
colons, while EA downregulated the expression of TNBS-induced cytokine genes.
Pathway analysis showed that EA significantly affected inflammatory pathways in
colons and immunity-associated pathway in spleens. Immunohistochemical staining
further showed that EA decreased the expression of interleukin-1 β and nuclear
factor- κ B. In conclusion, this is the first study reporting the global gene
expression profiles of EA on TNBS-induced colitis. Our findings suggested that
inflammatory and immunity pathways were involved in the anti-inflammatory
mechanism of EA on colitis induced by TNBS.

The Caco-2 cell line is one of the most important in vitro models for
enterocytes, and is used to study drug absorption and disease, including
inflammatory bowel disease and cancer. In order to use the model optimally, it is
necessary to map its functional entities. In this study, we have generated
genome-wide maps of active transcription start sites (TSSs), and active enhancers
in Caco-2 cells with or without tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α stimulation to
mimic an inflammatory state. We found 520 promoters that significantly changed
their usage level upon TNF-α stimulation; of these, 52% are not annotated. A
subset of these has the potential to confer change in protein function due to
protein domain exclusion. Moreover, we locate 890 transcribed enhancer
candidates, where ∼50% are changing in usage after TNF-α stimulation. These
enhancers share motif enrichments with similarly responding gene promoters. As a 
case example, we characterize an enhancer regulating the laminin-5 γ2-chain
(LAMC2) gene by nuclear factor (NF)-κB binding. This report is the first to
present comprehensive TSS and enhancer maps over Caco-2 cells, and highlights
many novel inflammation-specific promoters and enhancers.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: The etiology of Crohn's disease (CD) implicates both genetic 
and environmental factors. Smoking behavior is one environmental risk factor to
play a role in the development of CD. The study aimed to assess the contribution 
of the interleukin 23 receptor (IL23R) in determining disease susceptibility in
two independent cohorts of CD, and to investigate the interactions between IL23R 
variants, smoking behavior, and CD-associated genes, NOD2 and ATG16L1.
METHODS: Ten IL23R single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in 675
CD cases, and 1255 controls from Brisbane, Australia (dataset 1). Six of these
SNPs were genotyped in 318 CD cases and 533 controls from Canterbury, New Zealand
(dataset 2). Case-control analysis of genotype and allele frequencies, and
haplotype analysis for all SNPs was conducted.
RESULTS: We demonstrate a strong increased CD risk for smokers in both datasets
(odds ratio 3.77, 95% confidence interval 2.88-4.94), and an additive interaction
between IL23R SNPs and cigarette smoking. Ileal involvement was a consistent
marker of strong SNP-CD association (P ≤ 0.001), while the lowest minor allele
frequencies for location were found in those with colonic CD (L2). Three
haplotype blocks were identified across the 10 IL23R SNPs conferring different
risk of CD. Haplotypes conferred no further risk of CD when compared with single 
SNP analyses.
CONCLUSION: IL23R gene variants determine CD susceptibility in the Australian and
New Zealand population, particularly ileal CD. A strong additive interaction
exists between IL23R SNPs and smoking behavior resulting in a dramatic increase
in disease risk depending upon specific genetic background.

Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-1 is an essential regulator of many
cytokine signaling pathways, including those upregulated in the inflamed colonic 
mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis. We sought to investigate whether the 
functional SOCS-1 -1478CA>del polymorphism is associated with UC susceptibility
and its disease phenotype in a Turkish clinical sample. A total of 104 subjects
were enrolled in a case-control study (52 UC cases and 52 controls). The SOCS-1
-1478CA>del polymorphism was genotyped using a polymerase chain
reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. The odds
ratio of the del allele for UC relative to the CA allele was not significant (OR 
= 1.04, 95 % CI 0.59-1.82, P = 0.88). These results did not change after
adjustment for age and sex in multivariable regression analysis (OR = 1.07, 95 % 
CI 0.42-1.69, P = 0.73). When the SOCS-1 -1478CA>del polymorphism was analyzed
among UC patients according to continuous disease and non-continuous disease, the
del allele was not associated with disease recurrence (OR = 1.56, 95 % CI
0.78-4.56, P = 0.83). Furthermore, when we divided UC patients into two groups
according to a previous history of colectomy, we found no significant effect of
the del allele (OR = 1.94, 95 % CI 0.55-5.61, P = 0.91). Taken together, these
findings suggest that SOCS-1 -1478CA>del polymorphism does not contribute to UC
susceptibility and its disease phenotype in Turkish subjects.

Transcriptional regulatory mechanisms likely contribute to the etiology of
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), as genetic variants associated with the disease
are disproportionately found at regulatory elements. However, the transcription
factors regulating colonic inflammation are unclear. To identify these
transcription factors, we mapped epigenomic changes in the colonic epithelium
upon inflammation. Epigenetic marks at transcriptional regulatory elements
responded dynamically to inflammation and indicated a shift in epithelial
transcriptional factor networks. Active enhancer chromatin structure at
regulatory regions bound by the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α
(HNF4A) was reduced during colitis. In agreement, upon an inflammatory stimulus, 
HNF4A was downregulated and showed a reduced ability to bind chromatin. Genetic
variants that confer a predisposition to IBD map to HNF4A binding sites in the
human colon cell line CaCo2, suggesting impaired HNF4A binding could underlie
genetic susceptibility to IBD. Despite reduced HNF4A binding during inflammation,
a temporal knockout model revealed HNF4A still actively protects against
inflammatory phenotypes and promotes immune regulatory gene expression in the
inflamed colonic epithelium. These findings highlight the potential for HNF4A
agonists as IBD therapeutics.

States of chronic inflammation such as inflammatory bowel disease are often
associated with dysregulated iron metabolism and the consequent development of an
anemia that is caused by maldistribution of iron. Abnormally elevated expression 
of the hormone hepcidin, the central regulator of systemic iron homeostasis, has 
been implicated in these abnormalities. However, the mechanisms that regulate
hepcidin expression in conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease are not
completely understood. To clarify this issue, we studied hepcidin expression in
mouse models of colitis. We found that dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis
inhibited hepcidin expression in wild-type mice but upregulated it in
IL-10-deficient animals. We identified two mechanisms contributing to this
difference. Firstly, erythropoietic activity, as indicated by serum
erythropoietin concentrations and splenic erythropoiesis, was higher in the
wild-type mice, and pharmacologic inhibition of erythropoiesis prevented
colitis-associated hepcidin downregulation in these animals. Secondly, the IL-10 
knockout mice had higher expression of multiple inflammatory genes in the liver, 
including several controlled by STAT3, a key regulator of hepcidin. The results
of cohousing and fecal transplantation experiments indicated that the microbiota 
was involved in modulating the expression of hepcidin and other STAT3-dependent
hepatic genes in the context of intestinal inflammation. Our observations thus
demonstrate the importance of erythropoietic activity and the microbiota in
influencing hepcidin expression during colitis and provide insight into the
dysregulated iron homeostasis seen in inflammatory diseases.

BACKGROUND: The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and
ulcerative colitis (UC), result from the combined effects of susceptibility genes
and environmental factors. Polymorphisms in genes regulating inflammation may
explain part of the genetic heritage.
METHODS: Using a candidate gene approach, 39 mainly functional single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) in 26 genes regulating inflammation were assessed in a
clinical homogeneous group of severely diseased patients consisting of 624
patients with CD, 411 patients with UC and 795 controls. The results were
analysed using logistic regression.
RESULTS: Sixteen polymorphisms in 13 genes involved in regulation of inflammation
were associated with risk of CD and/or UC (p ≤ 0.05). The polymorphisms TLR2
(rs1816702), NFKB1 (rs28362491), TNFRSF1A (rs4149570), IL6R (rs4537545), IL23R
(rs11209026) and PTPN22 (rs2476601) were associated with risk of CD and the
polymorphisms TLR2 (rs1816702), TLR4 (rs1554973 and rs12377632), TLR9 (rs352139),
LY96 (rs11465996), NFKBIA (rs696), TNFA (rs1800629), TNFRSF1A (rs4149570), IL10
(rs3024505), IL23R (rs11209026), PTPN22 (rs2476601) and PPARG (rs1801282) were
associated with risk of UC. When including all patients (IBD) the polymorphisms
TLR2 (rs4696480 and rs1816702), TLR4 (rs1554973 and rs12377632), TLR9 (rs187084),
TNFRSF1A (rs4149570), IL6R (rs4537545), IL10 (rs3024505), IL23R (rs11209026) and 
PTPN22 (rs2476601) were associated with risk. After Bonferroni correction for
multiple testing, both the homozygous and the heterozygous variant genotypes of
IL23R G>A(rs11209026) (OR(CD,adj): 0.38, 95% CI: 0.21-0.67, p = 0.03; OR(IBD,adj)
0.43, 95% CI: 0.28-0.67, p = 0.007) and PTPN22 1858 G>A(rs2476601) (OR(CD,unadj) 
0.54, 95% CI: 0.41-0.72, p = 7*10-4; OR(IBD,unadj): 0.61, 95% CI: 0.48-0.77, p = 
0.001) were associated with reduced risk of CD.
CONCLUSION: The biological effects of the studied polymorphisms suggest that
genetically determined high inflammatory response was associated with increased
risk of CD. The many SNPs found in TLRs suggest that the host microbial
composition or environmental factors in the gut are involved in risk of IBD in
genetically susceptible individuals.

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a complex disease involving multiple risk factors,
both genetic and environmental. AS patients are predominantly young men, and the 
disease is characterized by inflammation and ankylosis, mainly at the
cartilage-bone interface and enthesis. HLA-B27 has been known to be the major
AS-susceptibility gene for more than 40 years. Despite advances made in the past 
few years, progress in the search for non-human leukocyte antigen susceptibility 
genes has been hampered by the heterogeneity of the disease. Compared to other
complex diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), fewer susceptibility 
loci have been identified in AS. Furthermore, non-major
histocompatibility-complex susceptibility loci discovered, such as ERAP1 and
IL23R, are likely contributors to joint inflammation. Identification and
confirmation of functional variants remains a significant challenge of
investigations involving genome-wide association studies (GWAS). It remains
unclear why none of the AS-susceptibility genes identified in GWAS appear to be
directly involved in the ankylosing process. Numerous reviews have recently been 
published on the genetics of AS. Therefore, aside from a brief summary of what AS
GWAS has successfully achieved thus far, this review will focus on directions
that could address unanswered questions raised by GWAS.

BACKGROUND: Extracellular ATP is a pro-inflammatory molecule released by damaged 
cells. Regulatory T cells (Treg) can suppress inflammation by hydrolysing this
molecule via ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 1 (ENTPD1), also
termed as CD39. Multiple studies have reported differences in CD39+ Treg
percentages in diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Hepatitis B and HIV-1. In
addition, CD39 polymorphisms have been implicated in immune-phenotypes such as
susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease and AIDS progression. However none
of the studies published so far has linked disease-associated variants with
differences in CD39 Treg surface expression. This study aims at identifying
variants affecting CD39 expression on Treg and at evaluating their association
with allergic rhinitis, a disease characterized by a strong Treg involvement.
METHODS: Cohorts consisting of individuals of different ethnicities were employed
to identify any association of CD39 variants to surface expression. Significant
variant(s) were tested for disease association in a published GWAS cohort by
one-locus and two-locus genetic analyses based on logistic models. Further
functional characterization was performed using existing microarray data and
quantitative RT-PCR on sorted cells.
RESULTS: Our study shows that rs7071836, a promoter SNP in the CD39 gene region, 
affects the cell surface expression on Treg cells but not on other CD39+
leukocyte subsets. Epistasis analysis revealed that, in conjunction with a SNP
upstream of the FAM134B gene (rs257174), it increased the risk of allergic
rhinitis (P = 1.98 × 10-6). As a promoter SNP, rs257174 controlled the expression
of the gene in monocytes but, notably, not in Treg cells. Whole blood
transcriptome data of three large cohorts indicated an inverse relation in the
expression of the two proteins. While this observation was in line with the
epistasis data, it also implied that a functional link must exist. Exposure of
monocytes to extracellular ATP resulted in an up-regulation of FAM134B gene
expression, suggesting that extracellular ATP released from damaged cells
represents the connection for the biological interaction of CD39 on Treg cells
with FAM134B on monocytes.
CONCLUSIONS: The interplay between promoter SNPs of CD39 and FAM134B results in
an intercellular epistasis which influences the risk of a complex inflammatory
disease.

Mucosal barrier, bacteria and inflammatory bowel disease: possibilities for
therapy.

The mucosal barrier has three major components, the mucus layer, the epithelial
glycocalyx and the surface epithelium itself, whose integrity largely depends on 
tight junction function. In health, there is relatively little direct interaction
between the luminal microbiota and the epithelium - the continuous mucus layer in
the colon keeps the surface epithelium out of contact with bacteria and the
ileo-caecal valve ensures that the distal small intestine is relatively microbe
free. Most interaction takes place at the Peyer's patches in the distal ileum and
their smaller colonic equivalents, the lymphoid follicles. Peyer's patches are
overlain by a 'dome' epithelium, 5% of whose cells are specialised M (microfold) 
epithelial cells, which act as the major portal of entry for bacteria. There are 
no goblet cells in the dome epithelium and M cells have a very sparse glycocalyx 
allowing easy microbial interaction. It is intriguing that the typical age range 
for the onset of Crohn's disease (CD) is similar to the age at which the number
of Peyer's patches is greatest. Peyer's patches are commonly the sites of the
initial lesions in CD and the 'anti-pancreatic' antibody associated with CD has
been shown to have as its epitope the glycoprotein 2 that is the receptor for
type-1 bacterial fimbrial protein (fimH) on M cells. There are many reasons to
believe that the mucosal barrier is critically important in the pathogenesis of
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). These include (i) associations between both CD 
and ulcerative colitis (UC) with genes that are relevant to the mucosal barrier; 
(ii) increased intestinal permeability in unaffected relatives of CD patients;
(iii) increased immune reactivity against bacterial antigens, and (iv) animal
models in which altered mucosal barrier, e.g. denudation of the mucus layer
associated with oral dextran sulphate in rodents, induces colitis. Whilst some
IBD patients may have genetic factors leading to weakening of the mucosal
barrier, it is likely that environmental factors may be even more important. Some
may be subtle and indirect, e.g. the effects of stress on the mucosa barrier,
whilst others may be more obvious, e.g. the effect of pathogen-related
gastroenteritis, known often to act as trigger for IBD relapse. We have also been
very interested in the potentially harmful effects of ingested detergents -
either by contamination of cutlery by inadequate rinsing or via ingestion of
processed foods containing permitted emulsifiers. In vitro and ex vivo studies
show that even very small trace amounts of these surfactants can greatly increase
bacterial translocation. Implications for therapy are not yet so obvious. We
advise our IBD patients to avoid processed foods containing emulsifiers and to
rinse their dishes well - whilst accepting that there is no direct evidence yet
to support this. Therapies that aim to enhance the mucosal barrier have yet to
come to market, but trials of enteric-delivered phosphatidylcholine in UC are
promising. The faecal concentration of mucus-degrading bacterial enzymes
(particularly proteases, sulphatases and sialidases) correlates with disease
activity in UC, and these represent good targets for therapy.

Crohn's disease: loss of tolerance or a disorder of autophagy?

Crohn's disease (CD) is characterized by a breakdown of the intestinal epithelial
barrier function leading to an uncontrolled immune response to bacterial
antigens. Available data demonstrate that appropriate response and early host
defense against invading bacteria are crucial to maintain tolerance towards
commensal bacteria. When the mechanisms of early removal of invading bacteria are
disturbed, a loss of tolerance and a full-blown adaptive immune reaction, which
is mounted against the usually harmless commensal flora, are induced. Dysfunction
of autophagy caused by genetic variations within CD susceptibility genes, such as
ATG16L1 and IRGM, results in defective handling of intracellular and invading
bacteria and causes prolonged survival and defective clearance of those microbes.
Dysfunction of ATG16L1 and IRGM has also been shown to cause aberrant Paneth cell
function and uncontrolled secretion of proinflammatory cytokines finally
resulting in increased susceptibility to bacterial infection and the onset of
colitis. Interestingly, autophagy can also be regulated by other CD
susceptibility genes, such as NOD2 (nucleotide oligomerization domain 2) or PTPN2
(protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 2) and the presence of the
CD-associated variations within these genes results in similar effects. Taken
together, more and more evidence suggests a close functional correlation between 
loss of tolerance and defective autophagy in CD patients. Therefore, most likely,
the onset of CD is triggered by both a loss of tolerance as well as a dysfunction
of autophagy, which finally results in the onset of chronic intestinal
inflammation.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Continuous stimulation of pattern recognition receptors
(PRRs), including nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-2 (NOD2) (variants in
NOD2 have been associated with Crohn's disease), alters the phenotype of
myeloid-derived cells, reducing production of inflammatory cytokines and
increasing microbe clearance. We investigated the mechanisms by which microbial
clearance increases in macrophages under these conditions.
METHODS: Monocytes were purified from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells
and differentiated to monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). We also isolated human
intestinal macrophages. Bacterial clearance by MDMs was assessed in gentamicin
protection assays. Effects of intracellular zinc and autophagy were measured by
flow cytometry, immunoblot, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and 
microscopy experiments. Small interfering RNAs were used to knock down specific
proteins in MDMs. NOD2-/- and C57BL/6J mice, maintained in a specific
pathogen-free facility, were given antibiotics, muramyl dipeptide (to stimulate
NOD2), or dextran sodium sulfate; intestinal lamina propria cells were collected 
and analyzed.
RESULTS: Chronic stimulation of human MDMs through NOD2 up-regulated the
expression of multiple genes encoding metallothioneins, which bind and regulate
levels of intracellular zinc. Intestinal myeloid-derived cells are stimulated
continually through PRRs; metallothionein expression was up-regulated in human
and mouse intestinal myeloid-derived cells. Continuous stimulation of NOD2
increased the levels of intracellular zinc, thereby increasing autophagy and
bacterial clearance. The metal-regulatory transcription factor-1 (MTF-1) was
required for regulation of metallothionein genes in human MDMs. Knockdown of
MTF-1 did not affect baseline clearance of bacteria by MDMs. However, the
increase in intracellular zinc, autophagy, and bacterial clearance observed with 
continuous NOD2 stimulation was impaired in MDMs upon MTF-1 knockdown. The
addition of zinc or induction of autophagy restored bacterial clearance to MDMs
after metallothionein knockdown. NOD2 synergized with the PRRs Toll-like
receptors 5 and 9 increase the effects of metallothioneins in MDMs. In mice, the 
intestinal microbiota contributed to the regulation in expression of
metallothioneins, levels of zinc, autophagy, and bacterial clearance by
intestinal macrophages.
CONCLUSIONS: In studies of human MDMs and in mice, continuous stimulation of PRRs
induces expression of metallothioneins. This leads to increased levels of
intracellular zinc and enhanced clearance of bacteria via autophagy in
macrophages.

Although several studies have investigated the essential roles of inflammation in
tumor progression, not many have systematically analyzed gene expression patterns
across diverse cancers in the context of inflammation. In this study, in order to
better understand the inflammatory scenario, we initially constructed the
inflammatory timeline (IT) based on two gene expression profiles during
inflammatory progression (inflammatory bowel disease and Helicobacter pylori
infection). Then, we separately identified the differentially expressed genes
(DEGs) from 25 cancer-related microarray data. By comparing the distributions of 
DEGs in the IT, we identified three novel pan-cancer gene expression patterns. In
the first pattern, the up-regulated genes in cancers were over-expressed in the
early phase of inflammation, while the down-regulated genes were over-expressed
in the late phase of inflammation. The second pattern was the opposite of the
first one. The third pattern appeared to be transitional between the first and
second patterns. We found that some cancers with different tissue origins have
similar gene expression patterns. Finally, we identified two sets of
tissue-independent inflammatory signatures that were over-expressed in early and 
late phases of inflammation, respectively. The dominant biological processes of
early inflammatory signatures were cell proliferation, DNA replication, and DNA
repair, whereas the late inflammatory signatures were reflective of innate immune
response, neutrophil migration, and antigen processing. These inflammatory
signatures may be useful to predict gene expression patterns in human cancers.
Therefore, the pan-cancer analysis of gene expression patterns in the context of 
inflammation provides a novel insight into cancers and an unprecedented
opportunity to develop new therapies.

Profiles of sequence variants that influence gene transcription are very
important for understanding mechanisms that affect phenotypic variation and
disease susceptibility. Using genotypes at 1.4 million SNPs and a comprehensive
transcriptional profile of 15,454 coding genes and 6,113 lincRNA genes obtained
from peripheral blood cells of 298 Japanese individuals, we mapped expression
quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). We identified 3,804 cis-eQTLs (within 500 kb
from target genes) and 165 trans-eQTLs (>500 kb away or on different
chromosomes). Cis-eQTLs were often located in transcribed or adjacent regions of 
genes; among these regions, 5' untranslated regions and 5' flanking regions had
the largest effects. Epigenetic evidence for regulatory potential accumulated in 
public databases explained the magnitude of the effects of our eQTLs. Cis-eQTLs
were often located near the respective target genes, if not within genes. Large
effect sizes were observed with eQTLs near target genes, and effect sizes were
obviously attenuated as the eQTL distance from the gene increased. Using a very
stringent significance threshold, we identified 165 large-effect trans-eQTLs. We 
used our eQTL map to assess 8,069 disease-associated SNPs identified in 1,436
genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We identified genes that might be truly
causative, but GWAS might have failed to identify for 148 out of the
GWAS-identified SNPs; for example, TUFM (P = 3.3E-48) was identified for
inflammatory bowel disease (early onset); ZFP90 (P = 4.4E-34) for ulcerative
colitis; and IDUA (P = 2.2E-11) for Parkinson's disease. We identified four genes
(P<2.0E-14) that might be related to three diseases and two hematological traits;
each expression is regulated by trans-eQTLs on a different chromosome than the
gene.

Enterohepatic Helicobacter species (EHS) often are associated with typhlocolitis 
and rectal prolapse in mice. We sought to describe rectal prolapses
histologically, relate lesions to mouse genotype and EHS infection status, and
characterize EHS pathogens on our campus. Our mouse population was housed among 6
facilities on our main campus and a seventh, nearby facility. We investigated
cases of rectal prolapse over 1 y and included 76 mice, which were broadly
categorized according to genotype. Microscopically, lesions ranged from mild to
severe typhlocolitis, often with hyperplastic and dysplastic foci. Neoplastic
foci tended to occur at the ileocecal-colic junction. Lesions were most severe in
strains that had lower-bowel inflammatory disease, notably IL10, Rag1, and Rag2
knockout strains; prolapses occurred in these strains when housed both in areas
with endemic EHS and in our Helicobacter-free barrier facility. Most mice with
rectal prolapses were immunocompromised genetically modified mice; however, the
most frequently sampled strain, the lamellipodin knockout, was noteworthy for its
high incidence of rectal prolapse, localized distal colonic and rectal lesions,
and lack of known immunodeficiency. This strain is being explored as a model of
rectal carcinoma. Most of the colons examined tested PCR-positive for EHS, often 
with coinfections. Although H. bilis is prevalent on our campus, we did not find 
this organism in any mice exhibiting clinical signs of rectal prolapse.
Identification of H. apodemus in 22% of cases has fueled increased surveillance
on our campus to characterize this organism and differentiate it from the closely
related H. rodentium.

BACKGROUND: Endoplasmic reticulum stress and unfolded protein response have been 
recently associated with the development of inflammatory bowel diseases in
adults. We aimed at assessing the involvement of these pathways also in
paediatric inflammatory bowel disease by analysing the expression of the main
genes involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress and correlating them with the
degree of intestinal inflammation.
METHODS: Real-time PCR and Western blot analysis of the expression of the
endoplasmic reticulum stress marker HSPA5 and of selected genes representing the 
three pathways of unfolded protein response (IRE-XBP1, PERK-ATF4, ATF6p90-p50) in
inflamed and uninflamed biopsies from 28 inflammatory bowel disease paediatric
patients and 10 controls.
RESULTS: HSPA5, PDIA4, as well as unspliced and spliced XBP1 mRNAs were
significantly increased in patients' inflamed colonic mucosa compared to
uninflamed mucosa and controls. HSPA5, PDIA4, ATF6, and phospho-IRE proteins were
also upregulated, indicating the activation of the IRE-XBP1 and ATF6p90-p50
branches of unfolded protein response. A positive significant correlation between
interleukin-8 levels, as a marker of inflammation, and upregulated genes was
found in the inflamed colonic mucosa.
CONCLUSION: A deregulation of the genes involved in the endoplasmic reticulum
stress and unfolded protein response pathways may be a key component of the
inflammatory response in paediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which can increase the risk of colorectal
cancer (CRC), includes two primary subtypes, ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's 
disease (CD). Although several individual genes involved in inflammation or
cancer characterization have been identified, it is still difficult to elucidate 
functional relationship details between the molecules underlying pathogenesis at 
the system level. The global effect of miRNAs on genes or their involved
functions is also poorly understood. We first integrated genome-wide gene
expression profiles and biological pathway information to explore the underlying 
associations among UC, CD and CRC at the function and gene level. After
identifying the pathways regulated by miRNAs, a global map of miRNA-mediated
pathway crosstalk shared by the three diseases was further constructed to
vertically explain the links of three level alterations. The three types of
diseases have close associations with each other at the levels of function, gene 
and miRNA regulation. Several key biological pathways are involved in the three
diseases, related to the immune system and inflammation, metabolism, or cell
proliferation and apoptosis etc. Moreover, miRNAs exhibit dominant effects on
multiple pathways. It is worth noting that UC shows relatively close associations
with CD and CRC at the three levels. Finally, the miRNAs could mediate the
crosstalk within or between pathways. For example, hsa-miR-125b, hsa-miR-335 and 
hsa-miR-155 mediated the crosstalk between three metabolic pathways. The
crosstalk within the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway could be mediated by
hsa-miR-124, hsa-miR-146a and hsa-mir-221/222. Our results make sense for the
prevention and treatment of intestinal-related chronic inflammation or cancer.

BACKGROUND: The main types of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are ulcerative
colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). There is evidence that, in addition to
immunological and environmental factors, genetic factors also play an important
role in the pathogenesis of IBD. Determination of polymorphism of CYP2D6 and NAT2
genes encoding I and II phase enzymes of xenobiotic biotransformation may have
clinical value as an indicator of individual predisposition to diseases, and also
contribute to effective and safe pharmacotherapy. The aim of this study was to
investigate the association between genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 and NAT2 and
the incidence of IBD, including UC and CD, among inhabitants of central Poland.
METHODS: The study was performed in 258 individuals from central Poland (115
patients with IBD, including 65 patients with UC and 50 with CD; and in 143
healthy controls). The CYP2D6 genotypes of oxidation and NAT2 genotypes of
acetylation were analyzed using the PCR-RFLP method.
RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in the frequency of 
the CYP2D6 genotypes and alleles in patients with IBD, UC and CD in comparison
with the control group. The relative risk (OR) of IBD, UC and CD was higher in
carriers of the allele NAT2*7 and was OR=3.49 (p=0.0019), OR=3.86 (p=0.0019), and
OR=3.02 (p=0.0247), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Polymorphism of the gene encoding CYP2D6 does not affect the
incidence of inflammatory bowel diseases. The carriers of the NAT2*7 allele which
determines slow acetylation may be more predisposed to inflammatory bowel
diseases, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: To date, only one gene (TNFSF15) has been identified and
validated as a Crohn's disease (CD)-associated gene in non-Caucasian populations.
This study was designed to identify novel CD-associated single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs)/genes and to validate candidate genes using a functional
assay.
METHODS: SNPs from 16 CD patients and 16 age- and sex-matched control patients
were analyzed using Illumina platform analysis. Subsequently, we expanded the
study and followed 53 CD patients and 41 control patients by Sequenom MassArray
analysis. Quantitative PCR and immunohistochemical staining were performed to
assess mRNA and protein expression of the candidate gene on tissue isolated from 
CD patients. Genotype was correlated with CD phenotypes. Finally, the candidate
gene was cloned and its effect on NF-κB activity assessed using a reporter
luciferase assay.
RESULTS: SLCO3A1 (rs207959) reached statistical significance in the first-stage
analysis (P = 2.3E-02) and was further validated in the second-stage analysis
(P = 1.0E-03). Genotype and phenotype analysis showed that the rs207959 (T)
allele is a risk allele that alters SLCO3A1 mRNA expression and is associated
with intestinal perforation in CD patients. Higher levels of mRNA and protein
expression of SLCO3A1 were seen in CD patients compared with the control group.
Overexpression of SLCO3A1 induced increased NF-κB activity and increased
phosphorylation of P65, ERK, and JNK. Nicotine augmented the activation of NF-κB 
in the presence of SLCO3A1.
CONCLUSIONS: SLCO3A1, a novel CD-associated gene, mediates inflammatory processes
in intestinal epithelial cells through NF-κB transcription activation, resulting 
in a higher incidence of bowel perforation in CD patients.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is characterized by repeated flare-ups of inflammation
that can lead to oncogenic insults to the colonic epithelial. UC-associated
carcinogenesis presents a different sequence of tumorigenic events compared to
those that contribute to the development of sporadic colorectal cancer. In fact, 
in UC, the early events are represented by oxidative DNA damage and DNA
methylation that can produce an inhibition of oncosuppressor genes, mutation of
p53, aneuploidy, and microsatellite instability. Hypermethylation of tumor
suppressor and DNA mismatch repair gene promoter regions is an epigenetic
mechanism of gene silencing that contribute to tumorigenesis and may represent
the first step in inflammatory carcinogenesis. Moreover, p53 is frequently
mutated in the early stages of UC-associated cancer. Aneuploidy is an independent
risk factor for forthcoming carcinogenesis in UC. Epithelial cell-T-cell
cross-talk mediated by CD80 is a key factor in controlling the progression from
low to high grade dysplasia in UC-associated carcinogenesis.

Crohn's disease (CD) is a complex and highly heterogeneous chronic inflammatory
disorder, primarily affecting the gastrointestinal tract. Genetic and functional 
studies have highlighted a key role for innate immunity in its pathogenesis.
Profound systemic defects in innate immunity and acute inflammation are
understood to result in markedly delayed clearance of bacteria from the tissues, 
leading to local chronic granulomatous inflammation and compensatory adaptive
immunological changes. Macrophages, key orchestrators of acute inflammation, are 
likely to play an important role in the initial impaired innate immune response. 
Monocyte-derived macrophages from CD patients stimulated with Escherichia coli
were shown to release attenuated levels of tumour necrosis factor and
interferon-γ with normal secretion of interleukin-8 (IL-8), IL-10 and IL-6. In
controls, the secretion of these cytokines was strongly positively correlated,
which was not seen with CD macrophages. The transcriptomes of CD and control
macrophages were examined in an attempt to understand the molecular basis of this
defect. There were no differentially expressed genes identified between the two
groups, consistent with genetic heterogeneity; however, a number of molecules
were found to be under-expressed in subgroups of CD patients. The most common of 
these was optineurin (OPTN) which was under-expressed in approximately 10% of the
CD patients. Reduced OPTN expression coincided with lower intracellular protein
levels and diminished cytokine secretion after bacterial stimulation both in the 
patients and with small interfering RNA knockdown in THP-1 cells. Identifying and
studying subgroups of patients with shared defective gene expression could aid
our understanding of the mechanisms underlying highly heterogeneous diseases such
as CD.

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are emerging globally, indicating that
environmental factors may be important in their pathogenesis. Colonic mucosal
epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, can occur in response to the
environment and have been implicated in IBD pathology. However, mucosal DNA
methylation has not been examined in treatment-naïve patients. We studied DNA
methylation in untreated, left sided colonic biopsy specimens using the Infinium 
HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. We analyzed 22 control (C) patients, 15
untreated Crohn's disease (CD) patients, and 9 untreated ulcerative colitis (UC) 
patients from two cohorts. Samples obtained at the time of clinical remission
from two of the treatment-naïve UC patients were also included into the analysis.
UC-specific gene expression was interrogated in a subset of adjacent samples (5 C
and 5 UC) using the Affymetrix GeneChip PrimeView Human Gene Expression Arrays.
Only treatment-naïve UC separated from control. One-hundred-and-twenty genes with
significant expression change in UC (> 2-fold, P<0.05) were associated with
differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Epigenetically associated gene
expression changes (including gene expression changes in the IFITM1, ITGB2,
S100A9, SLPI, SAA1, and STAT3 genes) were linked to colonic mucosal immune and
defense responses. These findings underscore the relationship between epigenetic 
changes and inflammation in pediatric treatment-naïve UC and may have potential
etiologic, diagnostic, and therapeutic relevance for IBD.

BACKGROUND: Genetic variants make some contributions to inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). More
than 100 susceptibility loci were identified in Western IBD studies, but
susceptibility gene has not been found in Chinese IBD patients till now.
Sequencing of individuals with an IBD family history is a powerful approach
toward our understanding of the genetics and pathogenesis of IBD. The aim of this
study, which focuses on a Han Chinese CD family, is to identify high-risk
variants and potentially novel loci using whole exome sequencing technique.
METHODS: Exome sequence data from 4 individuals belonging to a same family were
analyzed using bioinformatics methods to narrow down the variants associated with
CD. The potential risk genes were further analyzed by genotyping and Sanger
sequencing in family members, additional 401 healthy controls (HC), 278 sporadic 
CD patients, 123 UC cases, a pair of monozygotic CD twins and another Chinese CD 
family.
RESULTS: From the CD family in which the father and daughter were affected, we
identified a novel single nucleotide variant (SNV) c.374T>C (p.I125T) in exon 4
of discs large homolog 1 (DLG1), a gene has been reported to play multiple roles 
in cell proliferation, T cell polarity and T cell receptor signaling. After
genotyping among case and controls, a PLINK analysis showed the variant was of
significance (P<0.05). 4 CD patients of the other Chinese family bore another
non-synonymous variant c.833G>A (p.R278Q) in exon 9 of DLG1.
CONCLUSIONS: We have discovered novel genetic variants in the coding regions of
DLG1 gene, the results support that DLG1 is a novel potential susceptibility gene
for CD in Chinese patients.

NK cells are innate immune cells known for their cytolytic activities toward
tumors and infections. They are capable of expressing diverse killer Ig-like
receptors (KIRs), and KIRs are implicated in susceptibility to Crohn's disease
(CD), a chronic intestinal inflammatory disease. However, the cellular mechanism 
of this genetic contribution is unknown. In this study, we show that the
"licensing" of NK cells, determined by the presence of KIR2DL3 and homozygous
HLA-C1 in host genome, results in their cytokine reprogramming, which permits
them to promote CD4(+) T cell activation and Th17 differentiation ex vivo.
Microfluidic analysis of thousands of NK single cells and bulk secretions
established that licensed NK cells are more polarized to proinflammatory cytokine
production than unlicensed NK cells, including production of IFN-γ, TNF-α, CCL-5,
and MIP-1β. Cytokines produced by licensed NK augmented CD4(+) T cell
proliferation and IL-17A/IL-22 production. Ab blocking indicated a primary role
for IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-6 in the augmented T cell-proliferative response. In
conclusion, NK licensing mediated by KIR2DL2/3 and HLA-C1 elicits a novel NK
cytokine program that activates and induces proinflammatory CD4(+) T cells,
thereby providing a potential biologic mechanism for KIR-associated
susceptibility to CD and other chronic inflammatory diseases.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: The colitis observed in patients with very early onset
inflammatory bowel disease (VEOIBD; defined as onset of disease at younger than 6
years of age) often resembles that of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) in
extent and features of colonic inflammation observed by endoscopy and histology. 
CGD is a severe immunodeficiency caused by defects in the genes that encode
components of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase
complex. We investigated whether variants in genes that encode NADPH oxidase
components affect susceptibility to VEOIBD using independent approaches.
METHODS: We performed targeted exome sequencing of genes that encode components
of NADPH oxidases (cytochrome b light chain and encodes p22(phox) protein;
cytochrome b-245 or NADPH oxidase 2, and encodes Nox2 or gp91(phox); neutrophil
cytosol factor 1 and encodes p47 (phox) protein; neutrophil cytosol factor 2 and 
encodes p67 (phox) protein; neutrophil cytosol factor 4 and encodes p40 (phox)
protein; and Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 and 2) in 122 patients
with VEOIBD diagnosed at The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto,
from 1994 through 2012. Gene variants were validated in an independent
International Early Onset Pediatric IBD Cohort Study cohort of patients with
VEOIBD. In a second approach, we examined Tag single nucleotide polymorphisms in 
a subset of patients with VEOIBD in which the NOX2 NADPH oxidase genes sequence
had been previously analyzed. We then looked for single nucleotide polymorphisms 
associated with the disease in an independent International Early Onset Pediatric
IBD Cohort Study cohort of patients. We analyzed the functional effects of
variants associated with VEOIBD.
RESULTS: Targeted exome sequencing and Tag single nucleotide polymorphism
genotyping identified 11 variants associated with VEOIBD; the majority of
patients were heterozygous for these variants. Expression of these variants in
cells either reduced oxidative burst or altered interactions among proteins in
the NADPH oxidase complex. Variants in the noncoding regulatory and splicing
elements resulted in reduced levels of proteins, or expression of altered forms
of the proteins, in blood cells from VEOIBD patients.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that VEOIBD patients carry heterozygous functional
hypomorphic variants in components of the NOX2 NADPH oxidase complex. These do
not cause overt immunodeficiency, but instead determine susceptibility to VEOIBD.
Specific approaches might be developed to treat individual patients based on
their genetic variant.

BACKGROUND: We have recently shown by formally modelling human protein
interaction networks (PINs) as metric spaces and classified proteins into zones
based on their distance from the topological centre that hub proteins are
primarily centrally located. We also showed that zones closest to the network
centre are enriched for critically important proteins and are also functionally
very specialised for specific 'house keeping' functions. We proposed that
proteins closest to the network centre may present good therapeutic targets.
Here, we present multiple pieces of novel functional evidence that provides
strong support for this hypothesis.
RESULTS: We found that the human PINs has a highly connected signalling core,
with the majority of proteins involved in signalling located in the two zones
closest to the topological centre. The majority of essential, disease related,
tumour suppressor, oncogenic and approved drug target proteins were found to be
centrally located. Similarly, the majority of proteins consistently expressed in 
13 types of cancer are also predominantly located in zones closest to the centre.
Proteins from zones 1 and 2 were also found to comprise the majority of proteins 
in key KEGG pathways such as MAPK-signalling, the cell cycle, apoptosis and also 
pathways in cancer, with very similar patterns seen in pathways that lead to
cancers such as melanoma and glioma, and non-neoplastic diseases such as measles,
inflammatory bowel disease and Alzheimer's disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the diversity of evidence uncovered, we propose that when
considered holistically, proteins located centrally in the human PINs that also
have similar functions to existing drug targets are good candidate targets for
novel therapeutics. Similarly, since disease pathways are dominated by centrally 
located proteins, candidates shortlisted in genome scale disease studies can be
further prioritized and contextualised based on whether they occupy central
positions in the human PINs.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an autoimmune disease of unknown etiology and
can lead to inflammation and cancer. Whey proteins contain many bioactive
peptides with potential health benefits against IBD. We investigated the effect
of low-temperature-processed whey protein concentrate (LWPC) on the suppression
of IBD by using a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis model in BALB/c
mice. Oral intake of LWPC resulted in improved recovery of body weight in mice.
Histological analysis showed that the epithelium cells of LWPC-treated mice were 
healthier and that lymphocyte infiltration was reduced. The increase in mucin due
to the LWPC also reflected reduced inflammation in the colon. Transcriptome
analysis of the colon by DNA microarrays revealed marked downregulation of genes 
related to immune responses in LWPC-fed mice. In particular, the expression of
interferon gamma receptor 2 (Ifngr2) and guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) was
increased by DSS treatment and decreased in LWPC-fed mice. These findings suggest
that LWPCs suppress DSS-induced inflammation in the colon by suppressing the
signaling of these cytokines. Our findings suggest that LWPCs would be an
effective food resource for suppressing IBD symptoms.

Campylobacter concisus is an emerging pathogen that has been associated with
gastrointestinal diseases. Given the importance of autophagy for the elimination 
of intracellular bacteria and the subversion of this process by pathogenic
bacteria, we investigated the role of autophagy in C. concisus intracellular
survival. Gentamicin protection assays were employed to assess intracellular
levels of C. concisus within Caco-2 cells, following autophagy induction and
inhibition. To assess the interaction between C. concisus and autophagosomes,
confocal microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron
microscopy were employed. Expression levels of 84 genes involved in the autophagy
process were measured using qPCR. Autophagy inhibition resulted in two- to
four-fold increases in intracellular levels of C. concisus within Caco-2 cells,
while autophagy induction resulted in a significant reduction in intracellular
levels or bacterial clearance. C. concisus strains with low intracellular
survival levels showed a dramatic increase in these levels upon autophagy
inhibition. Confocal microscopy showed co-localization of the bacterium with
autophagosomes, while transmission electron microscopy identified intracellular
bacteria persisting within autophagic vesicles. Further, qPCR showed that
following infection, 13 genes involved in the autophagy process were
significantly regulated, and a further five showed borderline results, with an
overall indication towards a dampening effect exerted by the bacterium on this
process. Our data collectively indicates that while autophagy is important for
the clearance of C. concisus, some strains may manipulate this process to benefit
their intracellular survival.

Defects in intestinal barrier function characterized by an increase in intestinal
permeability contribute to intestinal inflammation. Growing evidence has shown
that an increase in intestinal permeability has a pathogenic role in diseases
such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and celiac disease, and functional bowel
disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome. Therefore, clarification of the
inflammatory responses, the defense pathway and the corresponding regulatory
system is essential and may lead to the development of new therapies. MicroRNAs
(miRNAs) are small (19-22 nt) noncoding RNA molecules that regulate genes at the 
post-transcriptional level by base-pairing to specific messenger RNAs for
degradation to repress translation. Recent studies suggested that miRNAs are
important in the immune response and mediate a critical role in multiple immune
response-related disorders. Based on these discoveries, attention has been
focused on understanding the role of miRNAs in regulating intestinal barrier
dysfunction, especially in IBD. Here, we provide a review of the most recent
state-of-the-art research on miRNAs in intestinal barrier dysfunction.

Isorhamnetin is an O-methylated flavonol present in fruit and vegetables. We
recently reported the identification of isorhamnetin as an activator of the human
pregnane X receptor (PXR), a known target for abrogating inflammation in
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The current study investigated the role of
isorhamnetin as a putative mouse PXR activator in ameliorating chemically induced
IBD. Using two different models (ulcerative colitis like and Crohn's disease
like) of experimental IBD in mice, we demonstrated that isorhamnetin abrogated
inflammation through inhibiting the activity of myeloperoxidase, the levels of
TNF-α and IL-6, the mRNA expression of proinflammatory mediators (iNOS, ICAM-1,
COX2, TNF-α, IL-2 and IL-6) and the phosphorylation of IκBα and NF-κB p65. PXR
gene overexpression inhibited NF-κB luciferase activity, and the inhibition was
potentiated by isorhamnetin treatment. PXR knockdown by siRNA demonstrated the
necessity for PXR in isorhamnetin-mediated up-regulation of xenobiotic metabolism
genes. Ligand pocket-filling mutants (S247W/C284W and S247W/C284W/S208W) of human
PXR weakened the effect of isorhamnetin on PXR activation. Molecular docking
studies and time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer competitive
binding assays confirmed the ligand (isorhamnetin)-binding affinity. These
results clearly demonstrated the ameliorating effect of isorhamnetin on
experimental IBD via PXR-mediated up-regulation of xenobiotic metabolism and
down-regulation of NF-κB signaling. The novel findings may contribute to the
effective utilization of isorhamnetin or its derivatives as a PXR ligand in the
treatment of human IBD.

We hypothesize that the phenomenon of allele-specific methylation (ASM) may
underlie the phenotypic effects of multiple variants identified by Genome-Wide
Association studies (GWAS). We evaluate ASM in a human population and document
its genome-wide patterns in an initial screen at up to 380,678 sites within the
genome, or up to 5% of the total genomic CpGs. We show that while substantial
inter-individual variation exists, 5% of assessed sites show evidence of ASM in
at least six samples; the majority of these events (81%) are under genetic
influence. Many of these cis-regulated ASM variants are also eQTLs in peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells and monocytes and/or in high linkage-disequilibrium with 
variants linked to complex disease. Finally, focusing on autoimmune phenotypes,
we extend this initial screen to confirm the association of cis-regulated ASM
with multiple complex disease-associated variants in an independent population
using next-generation bisulfite sequencing. These four variants are implicated in
complex phenotypes such as ulcerative colitis and AIDS progression disease
(rs10491434), Celiac disease (rs2762051), Crohn's disease, IgA nephropathy and
early-onset inflammatory bowel disease (rs713875) and height (rs6569648). Our
results suggest cis-regulated ASM may provide a mechanistic link between the
non-coding genetic changes and phenotypic variation observed in these diseases
and further suggests a route to integrating DNA methylation status with GWAS
results.

Failure in establishment and maintenance of epithelial cell polarity contributes 
to tumorigenesis. Loss of expression and function of cell polarity proteins is
directly related to epithelial cell polarity maintenance. The polarity protein
discs large homolog 5 (DLG5) belongs to a family of molecular scaffolding
proteins called Membrane Associated Guanylate Kinases (MAGUKs). As the other
family members, DLG5 contains the multi-PDZ, SH3 and GUK domains. DLG5 has
evolved in the same manner as DLG1 and ZO1, two well-studied MAGUKs proteins.
Just like DLG1 and ZO1, DLG5 plays a role in cell migration, cell adhesion,
precursor cell division, cell proliferation, epithelial cell polarity
maintenance, and transmission of extracellular signals to the membrane and
cytoskeleton. Since the roles of DLG5 in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and
Crohn's disease (CD) have been reviewed, here, our review focuses on the roles of
DLG5 in epithelial cell polarity maintenance and cancer development.

Recent studies have identified more than 160 inflammatory bowel disease
susceptibility loci and provided evidence for genetic heritability in disease
pathogenesis. Here we describe a case of a 47-year-old White woman suffering from
Crohn's disease (CD), who had four children, two with CD and two with a factor V 
Leiden variation. We analysed the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms in 
several CD susceptibility genes. SNP analysis was carried out using commercially 
available assays. The female CD patient had a positive inflammatory bowel disease
family history. All of the patients had a mild disease course, without fistulae
or symptomatic stenosis. The patient was heterozygous for risk variants of the
genes encoding nucleotide oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) and Toll-like receptor 
5 (TLR5) and a homozygous carrier of both of the identified protein tyrosine
phosphatase nonreceptor type 2 (PTPN2) risk alleles. The CD-affected daughter
carried heterozygous risk alleles of the genes encoding TLR5, NOD2 and PTPN2. The
son, with the earliest onset of disease in the family at the age of 12 years, was
heterozygous for risk alleles of autophagy 16 like 1 (ATG16L1), TLR5, NOD2 and
PTPN2. This study reports an interesting pattern of CD-associated single
nucleotide polymorphisms in a family with CD. This report clearly supports the
observation that genetic variations, especially in genes associated with the
innate immune system, contribute to disease onset.

BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with complex pathogenic pathways
involving defects in apoptosis mechanisms. Recently, mesenteric adipose tissue
(MAT) has been associated with CD ethiopathology, since adipose thickening is
detected close to the affected intestinal area. However, the potential role of
altered apoptosis in MAT of CD has not been addressed.
AIMS: To evaluate apoptosis in the intestinal mucosa and MAT of patients with CD.
METHODS: Samples of intestinal mucosa and MAT from patients with ileocecal CD and
from non-inflammatory bowel diseases patients (controls) were studied. Apoptosis 
was assessed by TUNEL assay and correlated with the adipocytes histological
morphometric analysis. The transcriptional and protein analysis of selected genes
and proteins related to apoptosis were determined.
RESULTS: TUNEL assay showed fewer apoptotic cells in CD, when compared to the
control groups, both in the intestinal mucosa and in MAT. In addition, the number
of apoptotic cells (TUNEL) correlated significantly with the area and perimeter
of the adipose cells in MAT. Transcriptomic and proteomic analysis reveal a
significantly lower transcript and protein levels of Bax in the intestinal mucosa
of CD, compared to the controls; low protein levels of Bax were found localized
in the lamina propria and not in the epithelium of this tissue. Furthermore,
higher level of Bcl-2 and low level of Caspase 3 were seen in the MAT of CD
patients.
CONCLUSION: The defective apoptosis in MAT may explain the singular morphological
characteristics of this tissue in CD, which may be implicated in the
pathophysiology of the disease.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Early-onset ulcerative colitis, which is considered severe
colonic inflammation that develops in infants and young children, can be caused
by alterations in interleukin (IL)-10 signaling, although other factors are
involved in its pathogenesis. We investigated whether loss of phosphatase and
tensin homologue (PTEN), which regulates many important cell functions such as
cell proliferation, cell survival, and Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling
pathways, contributes to the development of colitis in Il10(-/-) mice.
METHODS: We generated Il10(-/-) mice (in C57BL/6 and C3H/HeJBir background
strains) with disruption of Pten in the intestinal epithelium
(Ints(ΔPten/ΔPten);Il10(-/-) mice) and Ints(ΔCont);Il10(-/-) (control) mice.
Colon tissues were collected and histological, transmission electron microscopy, 
and gene expression analysis were performed. Fecal microbiota samples were
analyzed by sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA genes. We disrupted Tlr4 in
Ints(ΔPten/ΔPten);Il10(-/-) mice. Lipopolysaccharide signaling via TLR4 was
blocked by treating mice with polymyxin B.
RESULTS: Il10(-/-) mice developed colitis when they were 6 to 7 months old,
whereas Ints(ΔPten/ΔPten);Il10(-/-) mice developed severe colitis and colon
tumors by the time they were 36 days old. Within 3 months of birth, 80% of
Ints(ΔPten/ΔPten);Il10(-/-) mice developed severe colitis and colonic malignancy,
whereas none of the Ints(ΔCont);Il10(-/-) mice had these phenotypes.
Ints(ΔPten/ΔPten);Il10(-/-) mice had alterations in fecal microbiota compared
with controls, such as increased proportions of Bacteroides species, which are
gram negative. Disruption of Tlr4 or treating Ints(ΔPten/ΔPten);Il10(-/-) mice
with polymyxin B delayed the development of colitis and reduced disease severity.
CONCLUSIONS: Disruption of Pten in the intestinal epithelium of Il10(-/-) mice
speeds the onset and increases the severity of colitis. Fecal microbiota from
Ints(ΔPten/ΔPten);Il10(-/-) mice have increased proportions of Bacteroides
species. Development of colitis is delayed and reduced by blocking TLR4
signaling. Ints(ΔPten/ΔPten);Il10(-/-) mice may be studied as a model for
early-onset ulcerative colitis and used to identify new therapeutic targets.

Animal host defense against infection requires the expression of defense genes at
the right place and the right time. Understanding such tight control of host
defense requires the elucidation of the transcription factors involved. By using 
an unbiased approach in the model Caenorhabditis elegans, we discovered that
HLH-30 (known as TFEB in mammals) is a key transcription factor for host defense.
HLH-30 was activated shortly after Staphylococcus aureus infection, and drove the
expression of close to 80% of the host response, including antimicrobial and
autophagy genes that were essential for host tolerance of infection. TFEB was
also rapidly activated in murine macrophages upon S. aureus infection and was
required for proper transcriptional induction of several proinflammatory
cytokines and chemokines. Thus, our data suggest that TFEB is a previously
unappreciated, evolutionarily ancient transcription factor in the host response
to infection.

The hypoxic response is mediated by two transcription factors, hypoxia-inducible 
factor (HIF)-1α and HIF-2α. These highly homologous transcription factors are
induced in hypoxic foci and regulate cell metabolism, angiogenesis, cell
proliferation, and cell survival. HIF-1α and HIF-2α are activated early in cancer
progression and are important in several aspects of tumor biology. HIF-1α and
HIF-2α have overlapping and distinct functions. In the intestine, activation of
HIF-2α increases inflammation and colon carcinogenesis in mouse models.
Interestingly, in ischemic and inflammatory diseases of the intestine, activation
of HIF-1α is beneficial and can reduce intestinal inflammation. HIF-1α is a
critical transcription factor regulating epithelial barrier function following
inflammation. The beneficial value of pharmacological agents that chronically
activate HIF-1α is decreased due to the tumorigenic potential of HIFs. The
present study tested the hypothesis that chronic activation of HIF-1α may enhance
colon tumorigenesis. Two models of colon cancer were assessed, a sporadic and a
colitis-associated colon cancer model. Activation of HIF-1α in intestinal
epithelial cells does not increase carcinogenesis or progression of colon cancer.
Together, the data provide proof of principle that pharmacological activation of 
HIF-1α could be a safe therapeutic strategy for inflammatory bowel disease.

BACKGROUND: As many as 50% of patients with ulcerative colitis who have undergone
ileal pouch-anal anastomosis develop de novo inflammation in the ileal pouch
after surgery. With the use of microarray technology, we investigated what gene
expression changes occur in the pelvic pouch after surgery for ulcerative colitis
and how these changes vary by pouch outcome.
METHODS: Patients who had undergone ileal pouch-anal anastomosis and closure of
ileostomy had biopsy specimens from the pouch and pre-pouch ileum prospectively
collected. The subjects were allocated into 4 outcome groups: no pouchitis,
pouchitis, Crohn's disease-like phenotype, and familial adenomatous polyposis
controls. RNA was extracted and transcriptomes were analyzed using a genome-wide 
approach. The statistical significance of each gene was assessed, and raw P
values were corrected for multiple comparisons.
RESULTS: The expression levels of 2733 transcripts in the pouch were
significantly associated with outcome. These genes could be classified into 3
categories: regulation of the immune system, modification of the extracellular
matrix, and xenobiotic activity. Contrary to the first 2 categories, genes
involved in xenobiotic activity, such as ABCB1, had lower expression in the
pouchitis and Crohn's disease-like groups compared with the no pouchitis and
familial adenomatous polyposis groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Transporters of compounds including xenobiotics are downregulated in
recurrent disease after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, whereas inflammatory
pathways are upregulated. These findings corroborate the hypothesis that changes 
in barrier function could contribute to development of intestinal inflammation.

Host defense peptides secreted by colonocytes and Paneth cells play a key role in
innate host defenses in the gut. In Crohn's disease, the burden of
tissue-associated Escherichia coli commonly increases at epithelial surfaces
where host defense peptides concentrate, suggesting that this bacterial
population might actively resist this mechanism of bacterial killing.
Adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC) is associated with Crohn's disease; however, the
colonization determinants of AIEC in the inflamed gut are undefined. Here, we
establish that host defense peptide resistance contributes to host colonization
by Crohn's-associated AIEC. We identified a plasmid-encoded genomic island
(called PI-6) in AIEC strain NRG857c that confers high-level resistance to
α-helical cationic peptides and α- and β-defensins. Deletion of PI-6 sensitized
strain NRG857c to these host defense molecules, reduced its competitive fitness
in a mouse model of infection, and attenuated its ability to induce cecal
pathology. This phenotype is due to two genes in PI-6, arlA, which encodes a
Mig-14 family protein implicated in defensin resistance, and arlC, an OmpT family
outer membrane protease. Implicit in these findings are new bacterial targets
whose inhibition might limit AIEC burden and disease in the gut.

Treatments for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), 
functional dyspepsia, or motility disorders are not adequate, and purinergic
drugs offer exciting new possibilities. Gastrointestinal symptoms that could be
targeted for therapy include visceral pain, inflammatory pain, dysmotility,
constipation, and diarrhea. The focus of this review is on the potential for
developing purinergic drugs for clinical trials to treat gastrointestinal
symptoms. Purinergic receptors are divided into adenosine P1 (A(1), A(2A), A(2B),
A(3)), ionotropic ATP-gated P2X ion channel (P2X(1-7)), or metabotropic
P2Y(1,2,4,6,11-14) receptors. There is good experimental evidence for targeting
A(2A), A(2B), A(3), P2X(7), and P2X(3) receptors or increasing endogenous
adenosine levels to treat IBD, inflammatory pain, IBS/visceral pain, inflammatory
diarrhea, and motility disorders. Purine genes are also potential biomarkers of
disease. Advances in medicinal chemistry have an accelerated pace toward clinical
trials: Methotrexate and sulfasalazine, used to treat IBD, act by stimulating
CD73-dependent adenosine production. ATP protects against NSAID-induced
enteropathy and has pain-relieving properties in humans. A P2X(7)R antagonist
AZD9056 is in clinical trials for Crohn's disease. A(3) adenosine receptor drugs 
target inflammatory diseases (e.g., CF101, CF102). Dipyridamole, a nucleoside
uptake inhibitor, is in trials for endotoxemia. Drugs for pain in clinical trials
include P2X(3)/P2X(2/3) (AF-219) and P2X(7) (GSK1482160) antagonists and A(1)
(GW493838) or A(2A) (BVT.115959) agonists. Iberogast is a phytopharmacon
targeting purine mechanisms with efficacy in IBS and functional dyspepsia.
Purinergic drugs have excellent safety/efficacy profile for prospective clinical 
trials in IBD, IBS, functional dyspepsia, and inflammatory diarrhea. Genetic
polymorphisms and caffeine consumption may affect susceptibility to treatment.
Further studies in animals can clarify mechanisms and test new generation drugs. 
Finally, there is still a huge gap in our knowledge of human pathophysiology of
purinergic signaling.

Instability of housekeeping genes (HKG), supposedly unregulated and hence used as
normalizers, may dramatically change conclusions of quantitative PCR experiments.
The effect of bowel inflammation on HKG remains unknown. Expression stability of 
15 HKG (ACTB, B2M, GAPDH, GUSB, HPRT1, IPO8, MRPL19, PGK1, PPIA, RPLP0, RPS23,
SDHA, TBP, UBC, and YWHAZ) in 166 bowel specimens (91 normal, 35 cancerous, and
40 inflamed) was ranked by coefficients of variation (CV%) or using dedicated
software: geNorm and NormFinder. The RPS23, PPIA, and RPLP0 were top-ranked,
whereas IPO8, UBC and TBP were the lowest-ranked HKG across
inflamed/cancerous/normal colonic tissues. The pairs RPS23/RPLP0, PGK1/MRPL19, or
PPIA/RPLP0 were optimal reference by CV%, NormFinder, and geNorm, respectively.
Colon inflammation affected HKG more pronouncedly than cancer with ACTB
significantly down- and B2M upregulated. In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),
different genes were top-ranked in a large and small bowel, whereas TBP, UBC, and
IPO8 were lowest-ranked in both. For patients with IBD at large, RPS23/PPIA,
PGK1/MRPL19, and PPIA/RPLP0 were found optimal by CV%, NormFinder, and geNorm,
respectively. ACTB and B2M expression was related to CRC stage and positively
correlated with clinical activity of IBD. Although GAPDH was upregulated neither 
in CRC nor IBD, it tended to positively correlate with tumor depth and Crohn's
disease activity index. Normalizing against GAPDH affected experimental
conclusions in a small but not large bowel. Bowel inflammation significantly
affects several classic HKG. The pair PPIA/RPLP0 is a common optimal reference
for studies encompassing tissues sampled from colorectal cancer and IBD patients.
Using ACTB or B2M is not recommended.

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is highly polymorphic at the population level, and
specific mtDNA variants affect mitochondrial function. With emerging evidence
that mitochondrial mechanisms are central to common human diseases, it is
plausible that mtDNA variants contribute to the "missing heritability" of several
complex traits. Given the central role of mtDNA genes in oxidative
phosphorylation, the same genetic variants would be expected to alter the risk of
developing several different disorders, but this has not been shown to date. Here
we studied 38,638 individuals with 11 major diseases, and 17,483 healthy
controls. Imputing missing variants from 7,729 complete mitochondrial genomes, we
captured 40.41% of European mtDNA variation. We show that mtDNA variants
modifying the risk of developing one disease also modify the risk of developing
other diseases, thus providing independent replication of a disease association
in different case and control cohorts. High-risk alleles were more common than
protective alleles, indicating that mtDNA is not at equilibrium in the human
population, and that recent mutations interact with nuclear loci to modify the
risk of developing multiple common diseases.

Fine-tuning of cytokine-inducing pathways is essential for immune homeostasis.
Consistently, a dysregulated increase or decrease in pattern-recognition receptor
(PRR)-induced signaling and cytokine secretion can lead to inflammatory bowel
disease. Multiple gene loci are associated with inflammatory bowel disease, but
their functional effects are largely unknown. One such region in chromosome 2q12 
(rs917997), also associated with other immune-mediated diseases, encompasses
IL18RAP. We found that human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) from rs917997 AA
risk carriers secrete significantly less cytokines than G carriers upon
stimulation of multiple PRRs, including nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain
2 (NOD2). We identified that IL-18 signaling through IL-18RAP was critical in
amplifying PRR-induced cytokine secretion in MDMs. IL-18RAP responded to
NOD2-initiated early, caspase-1-dependent autocrine IL-18, which dramatically
enhanced MAPK, NF-κB, PI3K, and calcium signaling. Reconstituting MAPK activation
was sufficient to rescue decreased cytokines in NOD2-stimulated
IL-18RAP-deficient MDMs. Relative to GG carriers, MDM from rs917997 AA carriers
had decreased expression of cell-surface IL-18RAP protein, as well as of IL-18R1 
and IL-1R1, genes also located in the IL18RAP region. Accordingly, these
risk-carrier MDMs show diminished PRR-, IL-18-, and IL-1-induced MAPK and NF-κB
signaling. Taken together, our results demonstrate clear functional consequences 
of the rs917997 risk polymorphism; this polymorphism leads to a loss-of-function 
through decreased IL-18RAP, IL-18R1, and IL-1R1 protein expression, which impairs
autocrine IL-18 and IL-1 signaling, thereby leading to decreased cytokine
secretion in MDMs upon stimulation of a broad range of PRRs.

Resident human lamina propria immune cells serve as powerful effectors in host
defense. Molecular events associated with the initiation of an intestinal
inflammatory response in these cells are largely unknown. Here, we aimed to
characterize phenotypic and functional changes induced in these cells at the
onset of intestinal inflammation using a human intestinal organ culture model. In
this model, healthy human colonic mucosa was depleted of epithelial cells by EDTA
treatment. Following loss of the epithelial layer, expression of the inflammatory
mediators IL1B, IL6, IL8, IL23A, TNFA, CXCL2, and the surface receptors CD14,
TLR2, CD86, CD54 was rapidly induced in resident lamina propria cells in situ as 
determined by qRT-PCR and immunohistology. Gene microarray analysis of lamina
propria cells obtained by laser-capture microdissection provided an overview of
global changes in gene expression occurring during the initiation of an
intestinal inflammatory response in these cells. Bioinformatic analysis gave
insight into signalling pathways mediating this inflammatory response.
Furthermore, comparison with published microarray datasets of inflamed mucosa in 
vivo (ulcerative colitis) revealed a significant overlap of differentially
regulated genes underlining the in vivo relevance of the organ culture model.
Furthermore, genes never been previously associated with intestinal inflammation 
were identified using this model. The organ culture model characterized may be
useful to study molecular mechanisms underlying the initiation of an intestinal
inflammatory response in normal mucosa as well as potential alterations of this
response in inflammatory bowel disease.

OBJECTIVE: Over 100 ulcerative colitis (UC) loci have been identified by
genome-wide association studies (GWASs) primarily in Caucasians (CEUs). Many of
them have weak effects on disease susceptibility, and the bulk of the
heritability cannot be ascribed to these loci. Very little is known about the
genetic background of UC in non-CEU groups. Here we report the first GWAS on UC
in a genetically distinct north Indian (NI) population.
DESIGN: A genome-wide scan was performed on 700 cases and 761 controls. 18
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (p<5×10(-5)) were genotyped in an
independent cohort of 733 cases and 1148 controls. A linear mixed model was used 
for case-control association tests.
RESULTS: Seven novel human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-independent SNPs from
chromosome 6, located in 3.8-1, BAT2, MSH5, HSPA1L, SLC44A4, CFB and NOTCH4,
exceeded p<5×10(-8) in the combined analysis. To assess the independent
biological contribution of such genes from the extended HLA region, we determined
the percentage alternative pathway activity of complement factor B (CFB), the top
novel hit. The activity was significantly different (p=0.01) between the
different genotypes at rs12614 in UC cases. Transethnic comparisons revealed a
shared contribution of a fraction of UC risk genes between NI and CEU
populations, in addition to genetic heterogeneity.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows varying contribution of the HLA region to UC in
different populations. Different environmental exposures and the characteristic
genetic structure of the HLA locus across ethnic groups collectively make it
amenable to the discovery of causative alleles by transethnic resequencing. This 
may lead to an improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying UC.

disease.

Crohn's disease is complicated by the development of fibrosis and stricture in
approximately 30% to 50% of patients over time. The pathogenesis of fibrostenotic
disease is multifactorial involving the activation of mesenchymal cells by
cytokines, growth factors, and other mediators released by immune cells,
epithelial cells, and mesenchymal cells. Transforming growth factor β, a key
activator of mesenchymal cells, is central to the process of fibrosis and
regulates numerous genes involved in the disordered wound healing including
collagens, and other extracellular matrix proteins, connective tissue growth
factor, and insulin-like growth factors. The activated mesenchymal compartment is
expanded by recruitment of new mesenchymal cells through epithelial to
mesenchymal transition, endothelial to mesenchymal transition, and invasion of
circulating fibrocytes. Cellular hyperplasia and increased extracellular matrix
production, particularly collagens, from fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, and smooth 
muscle cells add to the disturbed architecture and scarring on the intestine.
Extracellular matrix homeostasis is further disrupted by alterations in the
expression of matrix metalloproteinases and tissue inhibitors of
metalloproteinase in the gut. Among the 163 susceptibility genes identified that 
contribute to susceptibility in inflammatory bowel disease mutations in
NOD2/CARD15, innate immune system components and autophagy jointly contribute to 
the activation of mesenchymal cells and pathogenesis of fibrosis in this
polygenic disorder. Numerous growth factors cytokines and other mediators also
contribute to development of fibrosis in the susceptible patient. This review
focuses on the molecular mechanisms that regulate mesenchymal cell function,
particularly smooth muscle cells, the largest compartment of mesenchyme in the
intestine, that lead to fibrosis in Crohn's disease.

Interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-13 are critical drivers of immune activation and
inflammation in ulcerative colitis, asthma and other diseases. Because these
cytokines may have redundant function, dual targeting holds promise for achieving
greater efficacy. We have recently described a bifunctional therapeutic targeting
IL-4 and IL-13 developed on a novel protein scaffold, generated by combining
specific binding domains in an optimal configuration using appropriate linker
regions. In the current study, the bifunctional IL-4/IL-13 antagonist was
evaluated in the murine oxazolone-induced colitis model, which produces disease
with features of ulcerative colitis. The bifunctional IL-4/IL-13 antagonist
reduced body weight loss throughout the 7-day course of the model, and
ameliorated the increased colon weight and decreased colon length that accompany 
disease. Colon tissue gene expression was modulated in accordance with the
treatment effect. Concentrations of serum amyloid P were elevated in proportion
to disease severity, making it an effective biomarker. Serum concentrations of
the bifunctional IL-4/IL-13 antagonist were inversely proportional to disease
severity, colon tissue expression of pro-inflammatory genes, and serum amyloid P 
concentration. Taken together, these results define a panel of biomarkers
signifying engagement of the IL-4/IL-13 pathway, confirm the T helper type 2
nature of disease in this model, and demonstrate the effectiveness of dual
cytokine blockade.

Accumulating evidence has indicated the implication of angiotensin II in the
pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) via its proinflammatory
features. Telmisartan (TLM) is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist with marked 
anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions that mediated its cardio-, reno- and
hepatoprotective actions. However, its impact on IBD has not been previously
explored. Thus, we aimed to investigate the potential alleviating effects of TLM 
in tri-nitrobenezene sulphonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in rats. Pretreatment 
with TLM (10 mg/kg p.o.) attenuated the severity of colitis as evidenced by
decrease of disease activity index (DAI), colon weight/length ratio, macroscopic 
damage, histopathological findings and leukocyte migration. TLM suppressed the
inflammatory response via attenuation of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α),
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity as a marker of
neutrophil infiltration besides restoration of interleukin-10 (IL-10). TLM also
suppressed mRNA and protein expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) p65 and 
mRNA of cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)
proinflammatory genes with concomitant upregulation of PPAR-γ. The alleviation of
TLM to colon injury was also associated with inhibition of oxidative stress as
evidenced by suppression of lipid peroxides and nitric oxide (NO) besides
boosting glutathione (GSH), total anti-oxidant capacity (TAC) and the activities 
of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). With respect to
apoptosis, TLM downregulated the increased mRNA, protein expression and activity 
of caspase-3. It also suppressed the elevation of cytochrome c and Bax mRNA
besides the upregulation of Bcl-2. Together, these findings highlight evidences
for the beneficial effects of TLM in IBD which are mediated through modulation of
colonic inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis.

BACKGROUND: Colitis-associated cancer (CAC) is the serious complication of
ulcerative colitis (UC), and molecular markers to evaluate the individual risk
are required. MicroRNA-124a (miR - 124a) is known to have tumor-suppressive
function and be methylation-silenced during exposure to chronic inflammation.
AIM: We analyzed whether higher methylation levels of miR-124a genes correlated
with the higher epidemiologic risk of CAC development in UC patients.
METHODS: Forty UC patients without CAC, four patients with CAC or dysplasia,
eight sporadic colorectal cancer (S-CRC) patients, and 12 healthy volunteers (HV)
were studied. Methylation status of miR-124a genes (miR-124a-1, -2, and -3) was
analyzed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP), and methylation
levels were quantified by real-time MSP. Expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 6 
(CDK6), a target of miR-124a, was analyzed by immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Three miR-124a genes were methylated in all neoplastic tissues (CAC,
dysplasia, and S-CRC), and CDK6 was highly expressed in those tissues. Regarding 
disease extent, mean methylation levels of miR-124a-3 in HV, non-pancolitis, and 
pancolitis were 2.0, 5.3, and 12.3%, respectively, and were significantly higher 
in pancolitis than in HV (p < 0.01). Regarding disease duration, mean methylation
levels in short-term and long-standing UC patients were 2.5 and 13.2%,
respectively. Long-standing UC patients had significantly higher methylation
levels than HV (p < 0.01). Moreover, UC patients with both pancolitis and
long-standing had 7.4-fold higher methylation levels than those without these
risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: MiR-124a genes are methylated during carcinogenesis in UC patients. 
The methylation level of miR-124a-3 is a promising marker for estimating
individual risk for CAC.

SCOPE: The aim of this study was to assess if exposure to different levels of
dietary vitamin D pre- and postweaning impacts the intestinal-bone axis.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Female CD1 mice were exposed to high (5000 IU vitamin D3 /kg
diet, H) or low (25 IU vitamin D3 /kg diet, L) vitamin D diet (modified AIN-93G) 
during pregnancy and lactation. At weaning (postnatal day 21), a subset of the
male offspring was sacrificed and another subset was assigned to receive their
dams' respective diet (HH and LL) or the other diet (HL and LH) until sacrifice
at 3 months of age. Lower level of vitamin D resulted in reduced vitamin D
receptor and increased expression of pro-inflammatory genes in the colon at 3
months, lower numbers of colonic Bacteroides/Prevotella at postnatal day 21 and
higher serum LPS concentration at adulthood. There was a programming effect of
vitamin D on LPS levels. Mineral content, density, and strength of femurs and
vertebrae were not affected.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that low vitamin D exposure results in an
inflammatory-prone status that may contribute to or be a risk factor for several 
diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, diabetes, and
cardiovascular diseases.

Although decreased intestinal IgA expression has been reported in dogs with
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the mechanism underlying this decrease is
unknown. Transmembrane activator and calcium-modulating cyclophilin-ligand
interactor (TACI) and B cell-activating factor of the TNF family (BAFF) receptor 
(BAFF-R) are key receptors for T cell-independent IgA class switching by the
binding of IgA-inducing cytokine a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) and
BAFF. Here we show decreased TACI and BAFF-R mRNA expression and hypermethylation
of their corresponding genes TNFRSF13B and TNFRSF13C, respectively in the
duodenal mucosa of dogs with IBD. To examine whether DNA methylation of the
TNFRSF13B and TNFRSF13C influences the mRNA expression of TACI and BAFF-R,
respectively, we first analyzed methylation and mRNA expression levels in vitro
using 2 canine B lymphoid cell lines, GL-1 and CLBL-1. Methylation profiles in
the cells were examined by bisulfite sequencing and methylation-specific PCR
(MSP) with primer pairs specific to methylated or unmethylated sequences. These
methylation analyses revealed hypermethylation of the CpG islands of both
TNFRSF13B and TNFRSF13C in GL-1, but not in CLBL-1 cells. The mRNA expression
levels of TACI and BAFF-R were significantly lower in GL-1 than in CLBL-1 cells. 
Treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine significantly increased TACI and BAFF-R
mRNA expression in GL-1 cells through demethylation of TNFRSF13B and TNFRSF13C,
respectively. These results suggest that the mRNA expression of TACI and BAFF-R
is regulated through methylation of their genes in canine B cells. Quantitative
real-time MSP showed significant hypermethylation of the CpG islands of TNFRSF13B
and TNFRSF13C in the duodenal mucosa of dogs with IBD. Furthermore, duodenal mRNA
expression levels of TACI and BAFF-R were significantly lower in dogs with IBD
than in healthy controls. The mRNA expression levels of TACI positively
correlated with intestinal IgA expression, whereas the methylation level of its
gene (TNFRSF13B) negatively correlated with IgA expression. The present results
suggest the role of TACI in the regulation of mucosal IgA expression through
epigenetic modifications.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Defects in the interleukin 10 (IL-10) signalling pathway
have been shown to cause very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We
report a patient with severe infantile-onset IBD with a compound heterozygous
IL-10 receptor alpha subunit (IL-10RA) mutation, one of which was
paternally-inherited and the other occurring de novo.
METHODS: Deep sequencing of IL-10, IL-10RA and IL-10 receptor beta subunit
(IL-10RB) were performed. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) surface
expression of IL-10RA was analysed by flow cytometry. IL-10 signalling pathway
was examined by measuring phosphorylated STAT3 in PBMC cultured in the presence
of IL-6 or IL-10.
RESULT: We identified a missense mutation in exon 4 of IL-10RA (c.583T>C) in one 
allele and a nonsense mutation in exon 7 of IL-10RA (c.1368G>T) in the other
allele. Neither mutation has been reported previously. The patient has functional
IL-10RA deficiency despite normal IL-10RA expression.
CONCLUSION: This represents the first case report of a de novo mutation of
IL-10RA that is associated with very early onset severe IBD. Therefore, IL-10
pathway defect should be considered in patients with infantile-onset IBD even if 
the parents are non-consanguineous.

AIM: To investigate the association between mutations in oligomerisation domain
2/caspase recruitment domains 15 (NOD2/CARD15) and the natural history of Crohn's
disease (CD) to identify patients who would benefit from early aggressive medical
intervention.
METHODS: We recruited thirty consecutive unrelated CD patients with a history of 
ileo-caecal or small bowel resection during the period 1980-2000; Fifteen
patients of these had post-operative relapse that required further surgery and
fifteen did not. Full sequencing of the NOD2/CARD15 gene using dHPLC for exons 3,
5, 7, 10 and 12 and direct sequencing for exons 2, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 11 was
conducted. CD patients categorized as carrying variants were anyone with at least
1 variant of the NOD2/CARD15 gene.
RESULTS: About 13.3% of the cohort (four patients) carried at least one mutant
allele of 3020insC of the NOD2/CARD15 gene. There were 20 males and 10 females
with a mean age of 43.3 years (range 25-69 years). The mean follow up was 199.6
mo and a median of 189.5 mo. Sixteen sequence variations within the NOD2/CARD15
gene were identified, with 9 of them occurring with an allele frequency of
greater than 10 %. In this study, there was a trend to suggest that patients with
the 3020insC mutation have a higher frequency of operations compared to those
without the mutation. Patients with the 3020insC mutation had a significantly
shorter time between the diagnosis of CD and initial surgery. This study included
Australian patients of ethnically heterogenous background unlike previous studies
conducted in different countries.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that patients carrying NOD2/CARD15 mutations
follow a rapid and more aggressive form of Crohn's disease showing a trend for
multiple surgical interventions and significantly shorter time to early surgery.

TNFα overexpression has been associated with several chronic inflammatory
diseases, including psoriasis, lichen planus, rheumatoid arthritis, and
inflammatory bowel disease. Paradoxically, numerous studies have reported
new-onset psoriasis and lichen planus following TNFα antagonist therapy. Here, we
show that genetic inhibition of Tnfa and Tnfr2 in zebrafish results in the
mobilization of neutrophils to the skin. Using combinations of fluorescent
reporter transgenes, fluorescence microscopy, and flow cytometry, we identified
the local production of dual oxidase 1 (Duox1)-derived H₂O₂ by Tnfa- and
Tnfr2-deficient keratinocytes as a trigger for the activation of the master
inflammation transcription factor NF-κB, which then promotes the induction of
genes encoding pro-inflammatory molecules. In addition, pharmacological
inhibition of Duox1 completely abrogated skin inflammation, placing Duox1-derived
H₂O₂ upstream of this positive feedback inflammatory loop. Strikingly, DUOX1 was 
drastically induced in the skin lesions of psoriasis and lichen planus patients. 
These results reveal a crucial role for TNFα/TNFR2 axis in the protection of the 
skin against DUOX1-mediated oxidative stress and could establish new therapeutic 
targets for skin inflammatory disorders.

OBJECTIVE: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genetic
variants within multiple risk loci as predisposing to intestinal inflammatory
diseases, including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and coeliac disease. Most
risk variants affect regulation of transcription, but a critical challenge is to 
identify which genes and which cell types these variants affect. We aimed to
characterise whole transcriptomes for each common T lymphocyte subset resident
within the gut mucosa, and use these to infer biological insights and highlight
candidate genes of interest within GWAS risk loci.
DESIGN: We isolated the four major intestinal T cell populations from pinch
biopsies from healthy subjects and generated transcriptomes for each. We
computationally integrated these transcriptomes with GWAS data from
immune-related diseases.
RESULTS: Robust, high quality transcriptomic data were generated from 1 ng of RNA
from precisely sorted cell subsets. Gene expression patterns clearly
differentiated intestinal T cells from counterparts in peripheral blood and
revealed distinct signalling pathways for each intestinal T cell subset.
Intestinal-specific T cell transcripts were enriched in GWAS risk loci for
Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and coeliac disease, but also specific
extraintestinal immune-mediated diseases, allowing prediction of novel candidate 
genes.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of transcriptomes for minimally manipulated
intestinal T lymphocyte subsets in humans. We have demonstrated that careful
processing of mucosal biopsies allows the generation of transcriptomes from as
few as 1000 highly purified cells with minimal interindividual variation.
Bioinformatic integration of transcriptomic data with recent GWAS data identified
specific candidate genes and cell types for inflammatory pathologies.

OBJECTIVES: Cost-effective guidance of therapeutic strategy in Crohn's disease
patients with secondary infliximab (IFX) treatment failure may be achieved by
serum IFX and anti-IFX antibody (Ab) measurements by radioimmunoassay (RIA). This
study investigated implications of using other techniques for this purpose.
METHODS: This is a post hoc analysis of randomized clinical trial including 66
Crohn's disease patients with IFX failure in whom IFX and anti-IFX Ab
measurements by RIA had been used for therapeutic guidance. Samples were
additionally assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), homogeneous
mobility shift assay (HMSA), and functional cell-based reporter gene assay (RGA).
RESULTS: IFX detection was comparable between assays (82% RIA, 76% ELISA, 88%
HMSA, and 74% RGA), and it correlated significantly (Pearson's r=0.91-0.97,
P<0.0001). However, IFX concentrations varied systematically between all pair of 
assays except RIA-RGA. Anti-IFX Ab detection was variable (27% RIA, 9% ELISA, 33%
HMSA, and 11% RGA), but correlated significantly (Pearson's r=0.77-0.96;
P<0.0001). Anti-IFX Abs detected by RIA and HMSA were often from sera without
drug-neutralizing activity (RGA). Assays agreed on classification of underlying
mechanism for treatment failure in most cases (79-94%). The majority (74-88%)
failed IFX owing to pharmacodynamic problems, or had noninflammatory
pathophysiology for symptoms resembling relapse. Applied threshold for
therapeutic vs. subtherapeutic IFX level influenced classifications. The four
different assays did not differ in terms of the ability to predict response to
interventions defined by the algorithm.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite variable analytical properties, common assays result in
similar classifications and interventions in patients with IFX treatment failure,
and with comparable clinical outcomes. Implications are, however, profound for
the minority classified differently.

In colon tumors, the transcription of many genes becomes deregulated by poorly
defined epigenetic mechanisms that have been studied mainly in established cell
lines. In this study, we used frozen human colon tissues to analyze patterns of
histone modification and DNA cytosine methylation in cancer and matched normal
mucosa specimens. DNA methylation is strongly targeted to bivalent H3K4me3- and
H3K27me3-associated promoters, which lose both histone marks and acquire DNA
methylation. However, we found that loss of the Polycomb mark H3K27me3 from
bivalent promoters was accompanied often by activation of genes associated with
cancer progression, including numerous stem cell regulators, oncogenes, and
proliferation-associated genes. Indeed, we found many of these same genes were
also activated in patients with ulcerative colitis where chronic inflammation
predisposes them to colon cancer. Based on our findings, we propose that a loss
of Polycomb repression at bivalent genes combined with an ensuing selection for
tumor-driving events plays a major role in cancer progression.

Infantile periods may have stronger genetic influences. Recently, studies on
genetic defects in the interleukin-10 (IL-10) signaling pathway have provided new
insights into inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study is to reveal whether
mutations of IL-10 signaling pathway genes contribute to the phenotypes of IBD.
Forty children who were diagnosed with IBD below the age of 10 years were
enrolled. We sequenced the genes interleukin-10 receptor A (IL-10RA), IL-10RB and
IL-10, and analyzed the clinical characteristics of very early-onset IBD
(VEO-IBD). In total, 14 out of the 40 children developed their symptoms within 1 
year of age. We found mutations in IL-10RA in 7 out of the 40 children (17.5%).
All seven children had developed symptoms within the first year of life.
Particularly, half of the children with infantile-onset IBD had IL-10RA
mutations. None of the remaining 26 children diagnosed above 1 year of age had
IL-10RA mutations. No mutations were found in IL-10RB and IL-10. Identified
IL-10RA mutations were p.(R101W), p.(Y91C), p.(R262C), p.(R117H) and p.(W69R).
IL-10RA mutations were associated with onset of infancy (P<0.001), perianal
fistulae (P<0.001), poor response to medical management (P=0.017) and early
surgical interventions (P<0.001). VEO-IBD in infancy is phenotypically and
genetically different disease entity from adult-onset or older child-onset IBD.
It has a strong association with IL-10 receptor gene. We should consider the
genotyping of genes of the IL-10 signaling pathway including IL-10RA in patients 
with VEO-IBD, especially in whom with onset of perianal fistulae and severe
colitis.

The gene encoding vitamin D receptor (VDR) is recognized as a promising candidate
for indicating the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Four genetic 
polymorphisms (ApaI, BsmI, FokI, TaqI) in VDR have been widely evaluated to
determine their association with IBD, and the results of these evaluations are
often inconsistent. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to shed some light on
this issue and explored the sources of the heterogeneity between studies. We
identified six articles for ApaI (cases/controls: 1902/1468), eight for TaqI
(3053/2145), and five each for BsmI (1512/1616) and FokI (2315/1676). Data were
analyzed under the random-effects model, and heterogeneity was explored by
subgroup analyses. Overall, except for TaqI in allelic comparison [odds ratio
(OR) = 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.83-0.98], ApaI, BsmI, and FokI
polymorphisms showed no significant associations with IBD across different
genetic models of inheritance. However, subgroup analyses indicated significance 
for the association of ApaI with Crohn's disease (CD) risk (AA versus aa: OR =
1.40; 95%CI = 1.05-1.88), for BsmI in East Asians (BB plus Bb versus bb: OR =
1.77, 95%CI = 1.14-2.74), for TaqI in Caucasians (TT plus Tt versus tt: OR =
0.79, 95%CI = 0.63- 1.00), and with ulcerative colitis (UC) risk (T versus t: OR 
= 0.89, 95%CI = 0.80-0.99). There was a low probability of publication bias for
all studied polymorphisms. Pooling previous individual studies on IBD, our
findings demonstrated that the ApaI polymorphism may increase the risk of CD,
whereas the TaqI polymorphism may decrease the risk of UC, especially in
Caucasians. Moreover, this study leaves open the question of divergent genetic
profiles across different ethnic groups.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammation of the large intestine. The aim
of this study was to investigate the association of two polymorphisms in STAT3
with the risk of UC development in the Chinese Han population. This is a
hospital-based case-control study involving 56 UC patients and 274 controls.
Genotyping was performed using the polymerase chain reaction with
sequence-specific primers (PCR-SSP) method. Statistical analyses were conducted
using logistic regression and genotype risk score. Overall, there was a
significant difference between patients and controls in the genotype distribution
of rs2293152 (P = 0.044). The risk for UC associated with the rs2293152-G mutant 
allele was increased (odds ratio = 2.76; 95% confidence interval = 1.06- 7.24)
under the dominant model. However, we failed to find any obvious differences in
the rs4796793 genotype or allele distributions between the UC patients and
controls, and did not detect any significant association of the rs4796793
polymorphism with UC across different genetic models of inheritance. Our study
implies that the STAT3 rs2293152 polymorphism may be associated with the
occurrence of UC and might be used as a predictive factor for UC in the Chinese
Han population.

Antitumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is used for treatment of severe cases of
inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative 
colitis (UC). However, one-third of the patients do not respond to the treatment.
Genetic markers may predict individual response to anti-TNF therapy. Using a
candidate gene approach, 39 mainly functional single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) in 26 genes regulating inflammation were assessed in 738 prior
anti-TNF-naive Danish patients with IBD. The results were analyzed using logistic
regression (crude and adjusted for age, gender and smoking status). Nineteen
functional polymorphisms that alter the NFκB-mediated inflammatory response (TLR2
(rs3804099, rs11938228, rs1816702, rs4696480), TLR4 (rs5030728, rs1554973), TLR9 
(rs187084, rs352139), LY96 (MD-2) (rs11465996), CD14 (rs2569190), MAP3K14 (NIK)
(rs7222094)), TNF-α signaling (TNFA (TNF-α) (rs361525), TNFRSF1A (TNFR1)
(rs4149570), TNFAIP3(A20) (rs6927172)) and other cytokines regulated by NFκB
(IL1B (rs4848306), IL1RN (rs4251961), IL6 (rs10499563), IL17A (rs2275913), IFNG
(rs2430561)) were associated with response to anti-TNF therapy among patients
with CD, UC or both CD and UC (P ⩽ 0.05). In conclusion, the results suggest that
polymorphisms in genes involved in activating NFκB through the Toll-like receptor
(TLR) pathways, genes regulating TNF-α signaling and cytokines regulated by NFκB 
are important predictors for the response to anti-TNF therapy among patients with
IBD. Genetically strong TNF-mediated inflammatory response was associated with
beneficial response. In addition, the cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and IFN-γ may be
potential targets for treating patients with IBD who do not respond to anti-TNF
therapy. These findings should be examined in independent cohorts before these
results are applied in a clinical setting.

BACKGROUND: Glucocorticoids (GCS) remain one of the mainstay treatments in the
management of ulcerative colitis (UC) but up to a third of patients will
ultimately fail to respond and progress to a more severe and difficult to manage 
disease state. Previous clinical studies suggest that the Toll-Like Receptor 9
(TLR9) agonist DIMS0150 not only induces production of key anti-inflammatory
cytokines as IL-10 but interestingly also enhances steroid sensitivity in steroid
refractory UC patients. We investigated, in the context of a clinical study,
whether a pre-selection of steroid response genes could identify steroid
refractory UC subjects most likely to respond to DIMS0150 treatment.
METHODS: In a non-interventional pilot study, blood from steroid refractory UC
patients and healthy volunteers was taken and thirty-four previously described
steroid response genes were analysed by real time PCR analysis. To establish
clinical utility of the identified biomarkers, a placebo controlled, randomized, 
double blinded study in active steroid dependent and steroid resistant UC
patients on concomitant steroid therapies was used (EudraCT number:
2006-001846-15).
RESULTS: We identified three potential biomarkers CD163, TSP-1 and IL-1RII whose 
response to steroids was significantly enhanced when DIMS0150 was applied.
Thirty-four subjects were randomized to receive a single rectal administration of
placebo or 30 mg of DIMS0150. Blood derived PBMCs were obtained prior to dosing
and assayed for evidence of a steroid enhancing effect following steroid
incubation in the presence of DIMS0150. Comparison to established steroid
sensitivity marker IL-6 confirmed that clinical responders are steroid refractory
UC patients. Upon study completion and un-blinding, the biomarker assay correctly
predicted a clinical response in over 90% of the patients.
CONCLUSION: Using specific steroid response biomarkers, GCS refractory UC
patients most likely to benefit from DIMS0150 treatment could be identified and
illustrates the usefulness of a personalized treatment approach.

BACKGROUND: Although pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized 
by extensive intestinal involvement and rapid early progression, the precise
cause and specific factors involved in disease aggravation have not been well
established. The aim of this study was to investigate the pathogenesis of
pediatric IBD.
METHODS: The expression of inflammatory molecules in colon samples taken from
active ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) patients was compared
with those of controls. Three children each with UC and CD in both the active and
remission phase and their controls were enrolled, and the inflammatory gene
expression in the mucosa was examined by microarray. Additionally, six children
from each group were further enrolled in a real-time reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction and an immunohistochemical study to examine the
expression of CXCL9, 10, 11, CXCR3, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, -3, -7, and
-10.
RESULTS: The microarray analysis revealed enhanced expression of the CXCL9, 10,
and 11 genes in the active phase of CD. The expression of MMP-1, -3, -7, and -10 
was significantly enhanced in the active phase of UC. These changes were also
confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed enhanced expression of CXCL9, 10, and 11 in
both the lamina propria and epithelial cells in these patients. CXCR3-positive
cells were also confirmed in the lamina propria. The expression of MMP-1, -3, -7,
and -10 was also enhanced in the mucosal epithelial cells and the lamina propria 
in both CD and UC patients.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that CXCR3 axis components and MMP play an
important role in the mucosal damage in pediatric IBD.

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic inflammatory disorders of the
intestine that result in painful and debilitating complications. Currently no
cure exists for IBD, and treatments are primarily aimed at reducing inflammation 
to alleviate symptoms. Genome-wide linkage studies have identified the Ron
receptor tyrosine kinase (TK) and its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor-like
protein (HGFL), as genes highly associated with IBD. However, only scant
information exists on the role of Ron or HGFL in IBD. Based on the linkage of Ron
to IBD, we directly examined the biological role of Ron in colitis. Wild-type
mice and mice lacking the TK signaling domain of Ron (TK-/- mice) were utilized
in a well-characterized model of chronic colitis induced by cyclic exposure to
dextran sulfate sodium. In this model, TK-/- mice were more susceptible to injury
as judged by increased mortality compared with control mice and developed more
severe colitis. Loss of Ron led to significantly reduced body weights and more
aggressive clinical and histopathologies. Ron loss also resulted in a dramatic
reduction in colonic epithelial cell proliferation and increased proinflammatory 
cytokine production, which was associated with alterations in important signaling
pathways known to regulate IBD. Examination of human gene expression data further
supports the contention that loss of Ron signaling is associated with IBD. In
total, our studies point to important functional roles for Ron in IBD by
regulating healing of the colonic epithelium and by controlling cytokine
secretion.

BACKGROUND: SLC22A23 is an orphan gene in the SLC22 family of organic membrane
transporters, and its single-nucleotide polymorphism rs17309827-T was recently
nominally associated with intestinal inflammation in a genome-wide association
study. Other polymorphisms in the SLC22A23 gene have been associated with
diseases with an inflammatory component, and polymorphisms in related genes in
the SLC22 family have been repeatedly associated with inflammatory bowel disease 
(IBD).
OBJECTIVE: In a candidate-gene study using a well-phenotyped, highly monitored,
Manitoban white cohort, we investigated whether variations in SLC22A23 were
associated with intestinal inflammation.
DESIGN: Selected genetic variations were genotyped by using fluorescent-based
assays or a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism
analysis in 160 individuals with Crohn disease, 149 individuals with ulcerative
colitis, and 142 healthy control subjects to determine genetic associations.
RESULTS: Homozygocity for single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs4959235-TT and
rs950318-GG was associated with IBD, whereby 6% of patients (18 of 311 cases)
carried these genotypes, but they were not seen in healthy controls.
CONCLUSION: Associations reported in this article add to the emerging evidence
that SLC22A23 variants could modify IBD risk. However, the biology of the gene
and impact of variations on the gene's functions need to be tested to validate a 
causative role.

BACKGROUND: Although the involvement of helper T (Th) and regulatory T (Treg)
cell-related immune molecules in pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
is widely accepted, no discriminatory mucosal expression profiles of these
molecules between ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) have been
clarified.
METHODS: Mucosal expression of 17 cytokines and transcription factors related to 
Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg were measured by quantitative PCR in endoscopic biopsies
from inflamed (40 from UC [UCI] and 20 from CD [CDI]) and noninflamed (47, 22,
and 25 from UC, CD, and controls, respectively) colon or ileum. The
discriminatory power of these markers to differentiate between the 2 diseases was
evaluated by linear discriminant analysis and, unsupervised, principal component 
analysis.
RESULTS: By univariate analysis, many targets were markedly increased in inflamed
versus noninflamed areas. However, marker expression was almost comparable
between UCI and CDI, with the largest difference in UCI-predominant interleukin
(IL) 21 and IL-13 with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(AUC) values of 0.704 and 0.664, respectively. In contrast, combinations of 2 to 
7 markers improved UCI versus CDI discrimination with AUC = 0.875 to 0.975. Among
these, a 5-maker set (interferon-γ, IL-12 p35, T-bet, GATA3, and IL-21)
demonstrated an AUC of 0.949 and a misclassification rate of 8.3%. Principal
component analysis also markedly separated UCI and CDI.
CONCLUSIONS: Inflamed mucosae from UC and CD could be discriminated with high
accuracy using combinations of Th cell-related markers. Multigene analysis,
possibly reflecting the underlying pathogenesis, is expected to be useful for
diagnosis, monitoring and further defining distinctive characteristics in
inflammatory bowel disease.

BACKGROUND: The clinical presentation of the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) is
extremely heterogenous and is characterized by various extraintestinal
manifestations and complications (EIM). Increasing genetic insight for IBD and
EIM shows multiple shared susceptibility loci. We hypothesize that, next to these
overlapping genetic risk loci, distinct disease pathways are shared between IBD
and EIM.
METHODS: The overlapping genetic risk loci for IBD and its EIM were searched in
literature. We assessed shared disease pathways by performing an extensive
pathway analysis by protein-protein interaction and cotranscriptional analysis,
using both publicly available and newly developed databases.
RESULTS: Reliable genetic data were available for primary sclerosing cholangitis,
ankylosing spondylitis, decreased bone mineral density, colorectal carcinoma,
gallstones, kidney stones, and deep venous thrombosis. We found an extensive
overlap in genetic risk loci, especially for IBD and primary sclerosing
cholangitis and ankylosing spondylitis. We identified 370 protein-protein
interactions, of which 108 are statistically specific. We identified 446
statistically specific cotranscribed gene pairs. The interactions are shown to
cluster in specific biological pathways.
CONCLUSIONS: We show that the pathogenetic overlap between IBD and its EIM
extends beyond shared risk genes to distinctive shared biological pathways. We
define genetic background as a risk factor for IBD-EIM alongside known mechanisms
such as malabsorption and medication. Clustering patients based on distinctive
pathways may enable stratification of patients to predict development of EIM.

The importance of desmosomes in tissue homeostasis is highlighted by natural and 
engineered mutations in desmosomal genes, which compromise the skin or heart and 
in some instances both. Desmosomal gene mutations account for 45-50% of cases of 
arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, and are mutated in an array of
other disorders such as striate palmoplantar keratoderma, hypotrichosis with or
without skin vesicles and lethal acantholytic epidermolysis bullosa. Recently, we
reported loss-of-function mutations in the human ADAM17 gene, encoding for the
'sheddase' ADAM17, a transmembrane protein which cleaves extracellular domains of
substrate proteins including TNF-α, growth factors and desmoglein (DSG) 2.
Patients present with cardiomyopathy and an inflammatory skin and bowel syndrome 
with defective DSG processing. In contrast, the dominantly inherited tylosis with
oesophageal cancer appears to result from gain-of-function in ADAM17 due to
increased processing via iRHOM2. This review discusses the heterogeneity of
mutations in desmosomes and their regulatory proteins.

Genetics in PSC: what do the "risk genes" teach us?

A role of genetics in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) development is now
firmly established. A total of 16 risk genes have been reported at highly robust 
("genome-wide") significance levels, and ongoing efforts suggest that the list
will ultimately be considerably longer. Importantly, this genetic risk pool so
far accounts for less than 10 % of an estimated overall PSC susceptibility. The
relative importance of genetic versus environmental factors (including gene-gene 
and gene-environment interactions) in remaining aspects of PSC pathogenesis is
unknown, and other study designs than genome-wide association studies are needed 
to explore these aspects. For some of the loci, e.g. HLA and FUT2, distinct
interacting environmental factors may exist, and working from the genetic
associations may prove one valid path for determining the specific nature of
environmental triggers. So far the biological implications for PSC risk genes are
typically merely hypothesized based on previously published literature, and there
is therefore a strong need for dedicated translational studies to determine their
roles within the specific disease context of PSC. Apparently, most risk loci seem
to involve in a subset of biological pathways for which genetic associations
exist in a multitude of immune-mediated diseases, accounting for both
inflammatory bowel disease as well as prototypical autoimmunity. In the present
article, we will survey the current knowledge on PSC genetics with a particular
emphasis on the pathophysiological insight potentially gained from genetic risk
loci involving in this profound immunogenetic pleiotropy.

MicroRNA deregulation is frequent in human colorectal cancers (CRCs), but little 
is known as to whether it represents a bystander event or actually drives tumor
progression in vivo. We show that miR-135b overexpression is triggered in mice
and humans by APC loss, PTEN/PI3K pathway deregulation, and SRC overexpression
and promotes tumor transformation and progression. We show that miR-135b
upregulation is common in sporadic and inflammatory bowel disease-associated
human CRCs and correlates with tumor stage and poor clinical outcome. Inhibition 
of miR-135b in CRC mouse models reduces tumor growth by controlling genes
involved in proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis. We identify miR-135b as a key
downsteam effector of oncogenic pathways and a potential target for CRC
treatment.

Chemerin is present in various inflammatory sites and is closely involved in
tissue inflammation. Recent studies have demonstrated that chemerin treatment can
cause either anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory effects according to the
disease model being investigated. Elevated circulating chemerin was recently
found in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however, the role of
chemerin in intestinal inflammation remains unknown. In this study, we
demonstrated that the administration of exogenous chemerin (aa17-156) aggravated 
the severity of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, which was
characterized by higher clinical scores, extensive mucosal damage and
significantly increased local and systemic production of pro-inflammatory
cytokines, including IL-6, TNF-α and interferon (IFN-γ). Interestingly, chemerin 
did not appear to influence the magnitudes of inflammatory infiltrates in the
colons, but did result in significantly decreased colonic expression of M2
macrophage-associated genes, including Arginase 1 (Arg-1), Ym1, FIZZ1 and IL-10, 
following DSS exposure, suggesting an impaired M2 macrophage skewing in vivo.
Furthermore, an in vitro experiment showed that the addition of chemerin directly
suppressed M2 macrophage-associated gene expression and STAT6 phosphorylation in 
IL-4-stimulated macrophages. Significantly elevated chemerin levels were found in
colons from DSS-exposed mice and from ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and
appeared to positively correlate with disease severity. Moreover, the in vivo
administration of neutralizing anti-chemerin antibody significantly improved
intestinal inflammation following DSS exposure. Taken together, our findings
reveal a pro-inflammatory role for chemerin in DSS-induced colitis and the
ability of chemerin to suppress the anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage response. Our
study also suggests that upregulated chemerin in inflamed colons may contribute
to the pathogenesis of IBD.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB
(NF-κB) has been associated with the development of inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD). Copper metabolism MURR1 domain containing 1 (COMMD1), a regulator of
various transport pathways, has been shown to limit NF-κB activation. We
investigated the roles of COMMD1 in the pathogenesis of colitis in mice and IBD
in human beings.
METHODS: We created mice with a specific disruption of Commd1 in myeloid cells
(Mye-knockout [K/O] mice); we analyzed immune cell populations and functions and 
expression of genes regulated by NF-κB. Sepsis was induced in Mye-K/O and
wild-type mice by cecal ligation and puncture or intraperitoneal injection of
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), colitis was induced by administration of dextran sodium
sulfate, and colitis-associated cancer was induced by administration of dextran
sodium sulfate and azoxymethane. We measured levels of COMMD1 messenger RNA in
colon biopsy specimens from 29 patients with IBD and 16 patients without
(controls), and validated findings in an independent cohort (17 patients with IBD
and 22 controls). We searched for polymorphisms in or near COMMD1 that were
associated with IBD using data from the International IBD Genetics Consortium and
performed quantitative trait locus analysis.
RESULTS: In comparing gene expression patterns between myeloid cells from Mye-K/O
and wild-type mice, we found that COMMD1 represses expression of genes induced by
LPS. Mye-K/O mice had more intense inflammatory responses to LPS and developed
more severe sepsis and colitis, with greater mortality. More Mye-K/O mice with
colitis developed colon dysplasia and tumors than wild-type mice. We observed a
reduced expression of COMMD1 in colon biopsy specimens and circulating leukocytes
from patients with IBD. We associated single-nucleotide variants near COMMD1 with
reduced expression of the gene and linked them with increased risk for ulcerative
colitis.
CONCLUSIONS: Expression of COMMD1 by myeloid cells has anti-inflammatory effects.
Reduced expression or function of COMMD1 could be involved in the pathogenesis of
IBD.

In inflammatory bowel diseases the presence of free-circulating DNA (fcDNA)
sequences in the sera is an established phenomenon, albeit its real biological
function still remains unclear. In our study the immunobiologic effects of a
single-dose, intravenously administered fcDNA of normal and colitic origin were
assayed in DSS-colitic and control mice. In parallel with disease and
histological activity evaluations changes of the TLR9 and inflammatory cytokine
signaling gene expression profiles were assayed in isolated cells of the lamina
propria. Intravenously administered colitis-derived fcDNA displayed a more
prominent beneficial action regarding the clinical and histological severity of
DSS-colitis than that of fcDNA of normal origin. Systemic administration of
colitis-derived fcDNA significantly altered the expression of certain
TLR9-related and proinflammatory cytokine genes in a clinically favorable manner.
Presumably due to induction of severe colitis, the subsequent marked inflammatory
environment may result changes in fcDNA with a potential to promote the
downregulation of inflammation and improvement of tissue regeneration.
Elucidating mechanisms of innate immune alterations by nucleic acids may provide 
further insight into the etiology of inflammatory bowel diseases, and develop the
basis of novel nucleic acid-based immunotherapies.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: FUT2 and FUT3 genes are responsible for the formation of
histo-blood group antigens, which act as binding sites for some intestinal
microbes. Several studies suggested that FUT2 gene might affect the intestinal
microbiota composition and modulate innate immune responses. However, the effect 
of FUT2 polymorphisms on Crohn's disease (CD) is uncertain. Our study aimed to
analyze associations of CD with FUT2 and FUT3 polymorphisms in Chinese
population.
METHODS: A total of 273 CD patients and 479 controls were recruited. The
genotypes of FUT2 (rs281377, rs1047781, and rs601338) and FUT3 (rs28362459,
rs3745635, and rs3894326) were detected by SNaPshot analysis.
RESULTS: Compared with controls, homozygote TT of FUT2 (rs1047781) was
significantly increased in CD patients (TT vs others; P = 0.002, odds ratio
[OR] = 1.767, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.235-2.528). The haplotype TT
formed with FUT2 (rs281377) and (rs1047781) was more prevalent in CD patients
than in controls (48.9% vs 43.5%, P = 0.046). Mutant T allele and homozygote TT
of FUT2 (rs1047781) were increased in colonic CD patients compared with controls 
(P < 0.001, OR = 1.843, 95% CI = 1.353-2.512; P < 0.001, OR = 2.607, 95%
CI = 1.622-4.191, respectively). Although allele and genotypic distributions of
FUT3 were not statistically different between CD patients and controls, mutant
allele and genotype of FUT3 (rs28362459) and (rs3745635) were significantly
discrepant in three subgroups of CD patients according to lesion locations (all
P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study strongly implicates the polymorphic locus of FUT2
(rs1047781) in CD susceptibility in Chinese population. Mutations of FUT3
(rs28362459) and (rs3745635) might influence the lesion locations in CD patients.

Background 4-Nonylphenol is a ubiquitous environmental toxin that is formed as a 
byproduct in the manufacturing and/or sewage treatment of regular household
items. Previous work in our lab has implicated 4-NP in the progression of
autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease in which macrophages
mistakenly attack the intestinal linings, causing chronic inflammation. Several
key pro-and anti-inflammatory molecules have been shown to be involved in the
manifestation of this disease, including IL-23A, COX-2, IL-8, TLR-4, and IL-10.
Material and Methods 4-NP's effects on these known mediators of IBD were
effectively analyzed using a novel model for IBD, by which 4-NP may promote an
inflammatory response. Data were collected using DNA Microarray, RT-PCR, and
ELISA, after 48 hour treatment of U937 histiocytic lymphocyte cells and COLO320DM
human intestinal epithelial cells with 1 nM and 5 nM concentrations of 4-NP.
Results Significant dysregulation of the expression of both pro- and
anti-inflammatory genes was observed in U937 cells that would promote and prolong
inflammation. However, TLR-4, IL-8, and COX-2 gene expressions showed
unprecedented effects in COLO320DM cells suggesting that these genes mediate
apoptotic processes within the gastrointestinal tract. Conclusions Overall, our
results suggest that 4-NP administration engenders immune responses linked to
apoptotic processes via dysregulation of macrophage signaling. In sum, 4-NP
appears to increases the risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease by
promoting or prolonging adverse progression of inflammation in the
gastrointestinal tract.

BACKGROUND: Therapeutic gene transfer is currently being evaluated as a potential
therapy for inflammatory bowel disease. This study investigates the safety and
therapeutic benefit of a locally administered lentiviral vector encoding murine
interleukin-10 in altering the onset and relapse of dextran sodium sulfate
induced murine colitis.
METHODS: Lentiviral vectors encoding the reporter genes firefly-luciferase and
murine interleukin-10 were administered by intrarectal instillation, either once 
or twice following an ethanol enema to facilitate mucosal uptake, on Days 3 and
20 in Balb/c mice with acute and relapsing colitis induced with dextran sulfate
sodium (DSS). DSS colitis was characterized using clinical disease activity,
macroscopic, and microscopic scores. Bioluminescence optical imaging analysis was
employed to examine mucosal lentiviral vector uptake and transgene expression.
Levels of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 in homogenates of rectal
tissue were measured by ELISA. Biodistribution of the lentiviral vector to other 
organs was evaluated by real time quantitative PCR.
RESULTS: Mucosal delivery of lentiviral vector resulted in significant
transduction of colorectal mucosa, as shown by bioluminescence imaging analysis. 
Lentiviral vector-mediated local expression of interleukin-10 resulted in
significantly increased levels of this cytokine, as well as reduced levels of
tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6, and significantly reduced the clinical
disease activity, macroscopic, and microscopic scores of DSS colitis. Systemic
biodistribution of locally instilled lentiviral vector to other organs was not
detected.
CONCLUSIONS: Topically-delivered lentiviral vectors encoding interleukin-10
safely penetrated local mucosal tissue and had therapeutic benefit in this DSS
model of murine colitis.

OBJECTIVE: Oncostatin M (OSM) is produced by activated T cells, monocytes, and
dendritic cells and signals through two distinct receptor complexes consisting of
gp130 and LIFR (I) or OSMR-β and gp130 (II), respectively. Aim of this study was 
to analyze the role of OSM in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) and intestinal
inflammation.
METHODS: OSM expression and OSM receptor distribution was analyzed by PCR and
immunohistochemistry experiments, signal transduction by immunoblotting. Gene
expression studies were performed by microarray analysis and RT-PCR. Apoptosis
was measured by caspases-3/7 activity. IEC migration and proliferation was
studied in wounding and water soluble tetrazolium assays.
RESULTS: The IEC lines Caco-2, DLD-1, SW480, HCT116 and HT-29 express mRNA for
the OSM receptor subunits gp130 and OSMR-β, while only HCT116, HT-29 and DLD-1
cells express LIFR mRNA. OSM binding to its receptor complex activates STAT1,
STAT3, ERK-1/2, SAPK/JNK-1/2, and Akt. Microarray analysis revealed 79 genes that
were significantly up-regulated (adj.-p ≤ 0.05) by OSM in IEC. Most up-regulated 
genes belong to the functional categories "immunity and defense" (p = 2.1 ×
10(-7)), "apoptosis" (p = 3.7 × 10(-4)) and "JAK/STAT cascade" (p = 3.4 ×
10(-6)). Members of the SERPIN gene family were among the most strongly
up-regulated genes. OSM significantly increased STAT3- and MEK1-dependent IEC
cell proliferation (p<0.05) and wound healing (p = 3.9 × 10(-5)). OSM protein
expression was increased in colonic biopsies of patients with active inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD).
CONCLUSIONS: OSM promotes STAT3-dependent intestinal epithelial cell
proliferation and wound healing in vitro. Considering the increased OSM
expression in colonic biopsy specimens of patients with active IBD, OSM
upregulation may modulate a barrier-protective host response in intestinal
inflammation. Further in vivo studies are warranted to elucidate the exact role
of OSM in intestinal inflammation and the potential of OSM as a drug target in
IBD.

BACKGROUND: Although the central nervous system (CNS) was once considered an
immunologically privileged site, in recent years it has become increasingly
evident that cross talk between the immune system and the CNS does occur. As a
result, patients with chronic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid
arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease or psoriasis, are often further burdened
with neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as depression, anxiety and fatigue. Despite 
the recent advances in our understanding of neuroimmune communication pathways,
the precise effect of peripheral immune activation on neural circuitry remains
unclear. Utilizing transcriptomics in a well-characterized murine model of
systemic inflammation, we have started to investigate the molecular mechanisms by
which inflammation originating in the periphery can induce transcriptional
modulation in the brain.
METHODS: Several different systemic and tissue-specific models of peripheral
toll-like-receptor-(TLR)-driven (lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipoteichoic acid and 
Imiquimod) and sterile (tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and
12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)) inflammation were induced in C57BL/6 
mice. Whole brain transcriptional profiles were assessed and compared 48 hours
after intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide or vehicle, using
Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays. Target gene induction, identified by microarray 
analysis, was validated independently using qPCR. Expression of the same panel of
target genes was then investigated in a number of sterile and other TLR-dependent
models of peripheral inflammation.
RESULTS: Microarray analysis of whole brains collected 48 hr after LPS challenge 
revealed increased transcription of a range of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs)
in the brain. In addition to acute LPS challenge, ISGs were induced in the brain 
following both chronic LPS-induced systemic inflammation and Imiquimod-induced
skin inflammation. Unique to the brain, this transcriptional response is
indicative of peripherally triggered, interferon-mediated CNS inflammation.
Similar models of sterile inflammation and lipoteichoic-acid-induced systemic
inflammation did not share the capacity to trigger ISG induction in the brain.
CONCLUSIONS: These data highlight ISG induction in the brain as being a
consequence of a TLR-induced type I interferon response. As considerable evidence
links type I interferons to psychiatric disorders, we hypothesize that interferon
production in the brain could represent an important mechanism, linking
peripheral TLR-induced inflammation with behavioural changes.

AIM: To investigate the correlation between rs1568885, rs1813443 and rs4411591
polymorphisms and response to infliximab in a cohort of Greek patients with
Crohn's disease (CD).
METHODS: One hundred and twenty-six patients diagnosed with CD based on standard 
clinical, endoscopic, radiological, and pathological criteria were enrolled in
this study at the Gastroenterology Unit of the 2(nd) Department of Surgery and at
the Colorectal Unit of the 1st Department of Propaedeutic Surgery. Infliximab at 
a dose of 5 mg/kg was administered intravenously at weeks 0, 2, 6 and then every 
8 wk. Clinical and serological responses were assessed using the Harvey-Bradshaw 
Index and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, respectively, and the endoscopic
response was evaluated by ileocolonoscopy performed at baseline and after 12-20
wk of therapy. The changes in endoscopic appearance compared to baseline were
classified into four categories, and patients were classified as responders and
non-responders. Genomic DNA from whole peripheral blood was extracted and
genotyping was performed by allele-specific polymerase chain reactions. χ (2)
test with Yate's correction based on the S-Plus was used to compare the genotype 
frequencies.
RESULTS: Eighty patients (63.49%) were classified as complete and 32 (25.39%) as 
partial responders to infliximab, while 14 (11.11%) were primary non-responders. 
No correlation was found between response to infliximab and patients'
characteristics such as age, gender and disease duration. There was consistency
between Harvey-Bradshaw index scores and serum CRP levels. The TT genotype of the
rs1568885 polymorphism was significantly related to partial response (P = 0.024) 
and resistance to infliximab (P = 0.007) while the AT genotype was more frequent 
in partial responders (P = 0.035) and in primary non-responders (P = 0.032).
Regarding rs1813443, the CC genotype was found to be associated with partial
response (P = 0.005) and primary resistance (P = 0.002) to infliximab while no
association was found between the rs4411591 polymorphism and the clinical
response to infliximab.
CONCLUSION: Based on our results, the rs1568885 and rs1813443 polymorphisms are
associated with clinical and biochemical response to infliximab in Greek patients
with Crohn's disease.

Azathioprine is a purine antimetabolite drug commonly used to treat inflammatory 
bowel disease (IBD). In vivo it is active after reaction with reduced glutathione
(GSH) and conversion to mercaptopurine. Although this reaction may occur
spontaneously, the presence of isoforms M and A of the enzyme
glutathione-S-transferase (GST) may increase its speed. Indeed, in pediatric
patients with IBD, deletion of GST-M1, which determines reduced enzymatic
activity, was recently associated with reduced sensitivity to azathioprine and
reduced production of azathioprine active metabolites. In addition to increase
the activation of azathioprine to mercaptopurine, GSTs may contribute to
azathioprine effects even by modulating GSH consumption, oxidative stress and
apoptosis. Therefore, genetic polymorphisms in genes for GSTs may be useful to
predict response to azathioprine even if more in vitro and clinical validation
studies are needed.

BACKGROUND: Anti-tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) therapy effectively induces and 
maintains remission in Crohn's disease (CD). Up to 40% of patients, however, fail
to respond to anti-TNFα.
OBJECTIVE: To identify the mechanisms underlying the persistence of mucosal
lesions in patients who fail to respond to anti-TNFα therapy.
DESIGN: An observational study based on whole-genome transcriptional analysis was
carried out using intestinal biopsy specimens from patients with CD receiving
(n=12) or not (n=10) anti-TNFα therapy. The transcriptional signature of
responders was compared with that of non-responders after anti-TNFα therapy.
Controls with non-inflammatory bowel disease (non-IBD) (n=17) were used for
comparisons. Genes of interest were validated by real-time RT-PCR in an
independent cohort of patients with CD receiving (n=17) or not (n=16) anti-TNFα
and non-IBD controls (n=7).
RESULTS: We confirmed that response to anti-TNFα is accompanied by significant
regulation of a large number of genes, including IL1B, S100A8, CXCL1, which
correlated with endoscopic activity. Remarkably, patients who failed to respond
to anti-TNFα showed a mixed signature, maintaining increased expression of IL1B, 
IL17A and S100A8, while showing significant modulation of other genes commonly
upregulated in active CD, including IL6 and IL23p19.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that anti-TNFα therapy significantly downregulates 
a subset of inflammatory genes even in patients who fail to achieve endoscopic
remission, suggesting that these genes may not be dominant in driving
inflammation in non-responders. On the other hand, we identified IL1B and IL17A
as genes that remained altered in non-responders, pointing to potentially more
relevant targets for modulating mucosal damage in refractory patients.

AIM: To analyze the prevalence of thiopurine-methyltransferase (TPMT) genotypes
and their association with drug toxicity in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
patients from southeastern Brazil.
METHODS: A total of 219 consecutive patients with IBD, of which 146 had Crohn's
disease and 73 had ulcerative colitis, regularly seen at the outpatient unit of
the Division of Gastroenterology at the University Hospital Pedro Ernesto of the 
State University of Rio de Janeiro, a tertiary referral center, were enrolled in 
this study from February 2009 to January 2011. We analyzed the presence of major 
TPMT genetic variants (TPMT 2, 3A, 3C) in IBD patients by means of a specific
allele and RFLP-PCR. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes by
proteinase-K/Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate digestion and phenol-chloroform extraction.
TPMT 2 (C238G), TPMT 3A (G460A/A719G), and TPMT 3C (A719G) genotypes were
detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction followed by direct sequencing
with specific primers. Clinical data were systematically recorded, and correlated
with the genotype results.
RESULTS: The distribution of the selected TPMT gene polymorphism TPMT 2 (C238G), 
TPMT 3A (G460A/A719G), and TPMT 3C (A719G) genotypes was 3.6%, 5.4%, and 7.7% of 
the patients, respectively. Among the side effects recorded from patients taking 
azathioprine, 14 patients presented with pancreatitis and/or an elevation of
pancreatic enzymes, while 6 patients had liver toxicity, and 2 patients exhibited
myelosuppression/neutropenia. TPMT polymorphisms were detected in 37/219 patients
(8 heterozygous for 2, 11 heterozygous for 3A, and 18 heterozygous for 3C). No
homozygotic polymorphisms were found. Despite the prevalence of the TPMT 3C
genotype, no differences among the genotype frequencies were significant.
Although no association was detected regarding myelotoxicity or hepatotoxicity, a
trend towards the elevation of pancreatic enzymes was observed for TPMT 2 and
TPMT 3C genotypes.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of TPMT genotypes was high among Brazilian patients.
Variants genes 2 and 3C may be associated with azathioprine pancreatic toxicity
in a IBD southeastern Brazilian population.

BACKGROUND: When done at a young age, appendicitis followed by appendectomy (AA) 
offers protection against ulcerative colitis development in later life. We
developed the first ever murine AA model. Using this model, we showed earlier
that previous AA ameliorated colitis. We aimed to determine whether autophagy
genes contribute to the anti-colitis protection conferred by AA, and if so, to
delineate the autophagy-linked genes involved in this.
METHODS: Mice with 2 laparotomies each served as controls (sham-sham). Distal
colons were harvested (4 AA-group colons, 4 sham-sham group colons), and RNA
extracted from each. The RNA was taken through microarray analysis or reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction validation. Gene set enrichment analysis 
software was used to analyze the microarray data.
RESULTS: Out of 28 key autophagy-related genes investigated (VPS15, VPS34,
FIP200, ATG03, ATG04A, ATG04B, ATG05, ATG07, ATG10, ATG12, ATG13b, ATG14,
ATG16L1, BECN1, GABARAPL1, IRGM1, IRGM2, LAMP2, LC3A, LC3B, RAB7A, UVRAG, NOD2,
XBP1, LRRK2, ULK1, ULK2, PTPN2), 7 have genetic associations with inflammatory
bowel diseases (ATG16L1, IRGM1, NOD2, XBP1, LRRK2, ULK1, PTPN2). There was slight
upregulation of IRGM1, FIP200, and ATG04A (P < 0.05), but no variations with the 
other 25 genes. In contrast, gene set enrichment analysis revealed that AA
downregulated 74 gene sets (associated with 28 autophagy genes) while
upregulating only 5 (false discovery rate <5%; P < 0.001) gene sets.
Additionally, 22 gene sets associated with the 7 autophagy + inflammatory bowel
disease-associated genes were downregulated by AA, whereas only 3 were
upregulated. The genes with maximum AA-induced gene set suppression were VPS15,
LAMP2, LC3A, XBP1, and ULK1.
CONCLUSIONS: AA induces profound autophagy suppression in the distal colon. The
AA-induced upregulation of individual genes (IRGM1, FIP200, ATG04A) could be a
reflection of complex compensatory changes or the initial abnormality that led to
the pronounced autophagy suppression. Autophagy suppression by AA may induce
lesser antigen processing, leading to lesser cross-reactive immunity between
microbes and self-antigens, and subsequent amelioration of colitis.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are characterized recurrent inflammation of
gastrointestinal tract. The etiology and pathogenesis this disease is currently
unclear, but it has become evident that immune and genetic factors are involved
in this process. The aim of this study was to determine whether gene
polymorphisms: MIF-173 G/C; CXCL12-801 G/A and CXCR4 C/T exon 2 position of
rs2228014 is associated with susceptibility to IBD. A total of 286 patients were 
examined with IBD, including 152 patients with ulcerative colitis and 134 with
Crohn's disease (CD) and 220 healthy subjects were recruited from the Polish
population. Genotyping for polymorphisms in CXCL12/CXCR4 and MIF was performed by
RFLP-PCR. Statistical significance was found for polymorphisms CXCR4, a receptor 
gene for CXCL12 genotypes and alleles in CD and for genotype C/T and T allele in 
ulcerative colitis with respect to control. This confirms the effect of CXCL12
gene. The interplay between CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4 affects homeostasis and
inflammation in the intestinal mucosa. Three-gene analysis in CD confirmed the
association of genotype GGGGCT. Statistical analysis of clinical data of patients
with ulcerative colitis showed significant differences in the distribution of
genotype C/T and T allele for CXCR4 in the left-side colitis. Having CXCR4/CXCL12
chemokine axis polymorphisms may predispose to the development of IBD. Activation
can also be their defensive reaction to the long-lasting inflammation.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common types of cancer in both
developed and developing countries. This disease is triggered by and progresses
via the sequential accumulation of multiple genetic alterations. In addition, the
interaction between low-penetrance genes and environmental factors can also
increase the risk of developing CRC. Since inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are
one of the predisposing factors for CRC, IBD-related genes might, to a certain
extent, be associated with cancer initiation. The nucleotide oligomerization
domain 2/caspase activating recruitment domain 15 gene (NOD2/CARD15) is the most 
well-established gene to be associated with increased susceptibility to Crohn's
disease. Thus, various studies have been performed to investigate the potential
contribution of this gene to CRC risk. In this study, we aimed to determine the
frequency of the Arg702Trp, Gly908Arg, 3020insC, Pro268Ser, and JW1 variants of
NOD2/CARD15, and to investigate their association with CRC susceptibility. A
total of 130 CRC patients and 212 healthy controls were recruited for this study.
Subsequently, real-time polymerase chain reaction with TaqMan was performed for
the genotyping of these NOD2/ CARD15 variants. None of the NOD2/CARD15 variants
was statistically associated to CRC susceptibility in our Malaysian population.
Our findings were remarkably similar to those of other Asian cohorts, which
indicated that these NOD2/CARD15 variants exhibit genetic heterogeneity between
Caucasian and Asian populations.

Inflammatory colorectal polyps (ICRPs) are commonly seen in miniature dachshund
(MD) dogs; typically, multiple polyps form with severe neutrophil infiltration.
ICRP is thought to be a novel form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but its
etiology has not been investigated. The innate immune system is implicated in the
pathogenesis of both human and canine IBD. Therefore, the aim of the current
study was to evaluate the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression profiles of pattern
recognition receptors (PRRs) and cytokines in ICRPs. Polyp tissues were collected
by colonoscopic biopsies from 24 MDs with ICRPs. Non-polypoid colonic mucosa was 
collected from all MDs with ICRPs and 21 clinically healthy beagles (as the
controls). The expression levels of the mRNAs encoding toll-like receptors (TLRs)
1-10; nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors NOD1 and
NOD2; and cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8/CXCL8, and TNF-α were evaluated by
quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Three of the 10 well-known candidate reference
genes were selected as housekeeper genes based on analyses from the GeNorm,
NormFinder, and BestKeeper programs. Levels of TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR6, TLR7,
TLR8, TLR9, TLR10, NOD2, and all cytokines were significantly upregulated in the 
polyps relative to those in the controls. There was significant decrease in the
expression levels of TLR3 and NOD1 in the polyp tissues compared to the
non-polypoid colonic mucosa obtained from MDs with ICRPs. All upregulated PRR
mRNAs were positively correlated with all proinflammatory cytokine mRNAs. This
study demonstrated the dysregulation of PRRs and proinflammatory cytokines in
ICRPs of MDs, which may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this
disease.

BACKGROUND: Crohn disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease often
accompanied by periodontal symptoms. Based on its function in immune response,
tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and its genetic variants have been discussed as
risk indicators in inflammatory processes. Therefore, the aim of the present
study is to investigate the impact of TNF-α polymorphisms on periodontal
parameters and inflammatory lesions of oral mucosa as a characteristic of CD.
METHODS: A total of 142 patients with CD were included in the study. Oral soft
tissue alterations and periodontal parameters were assessed. Genotypes, alleles, 
and haplotypes of TNF-α polymorphisms (rs1800629, cDNA-308G > A; and rs361525,
cDNA-238G > A) were determined by polymerase chain reaction with
sequence-specific primers (PCR-SSP).
RESULTS: Patients with CD who exhibit more severe oral soft tissue alterations
were significantly more often A allele carriers of rs361525 than G allele
carriers (14.2% versus 2.2%; P <0.001). Furthermore, A allele carriers had a
higher mean periodontal probing depth (P <0.05), mean clinical attachment level
(P <0.05), and sites with bleeding on probing (not significant). Similar results 
were obtained when evaluating A allele-containing genotypes (AG + AA) and
haplotypes (GA). In multivariate analyses considering age, sex, smoking, and
medication as confounders, the A allele was proven to be an independent risk
indicator for oral soft tissue alterations in patients with CD. No
genotype-dependent influence of rs1800629 was observed.
CONCLUSION: The TNF-α A allele of rs361525 represents a significant risk
indicator for oral soft tissue alterations in patients with CD.

BACKGROUND: The Th17/IL23 pathway has both genetically and biologically been
implicated in the pathogenesis of the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn's 
disease, and ulcerative colitis. So far, it is unknown whether and how associated
risk variants affect expression of the genes encoding for Th17/IL23 pathway
proteins.
METHODS: Ten IBD-associated SNPs residing near Th17/IL23 genes were used to
construct a genetic risk model in 753 Dutch IBD cases and 1045 controls. In an
independent cohort of 40 Crohn's disease, 40 ulcerative colitis, and 40 controls,
the genetic risk load and presence of IBD were correlated to quantitative
PCR-generated messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of 9 representative Th17/IL23 genes
in both unstimulated and PMA/CaLo stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. 
In 1240 individuals with various immunological diseases with whole genome
genotype and mRNA-expression data, we also assessed correlation between genetic
risk load and differential mRNA expression and sought for SNPs affecting
expression of all currently known Th17/IL23 pathway genes (cis-expression
quantitative trait locus).
RESULTS: The presence of IBD, but not the genetic risk load, was correlated to
differential mRNA expression for IL6 in unstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear
cells and to IL23A and RORC in response to stimulation. The cis-expression
quantitative trait locus analysis showed little evidence for correlation between 
genetic risk load and mRNA expression of Th17/IL23 genes, because we identified
for only 2 of 22 Th17/IL23 genes a cis-expression quantitative trait locus single
nucleotide polymorphism that is also associated to IBD (STAT3 and CCR6).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that only the presence of IBD and not the
genetic risk load alters mRNA expression levels of IBD-associated Th17/IL23
genes.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Little evidence demonstrating the correlation between
several single nucleotide polymorphisms and a specific phenotype of Crohn's
disease has been reported in children. We investigated the relationship between
autophagy genes variants and clinical features in our children with Crohn's
disease.
METHODS: Genotyping for ATG16L1, NOD2/CARD15, and IRGM1 was performed in 80
consecutive patients with Crohn's disease (median age: 11 years; range: 0.7-17.9 
years). Crohn's disease location and behaviour were classified using the Paris
classification. Additional data were collected from clinical records on patients'
demographics, age at symptom onset and diagnosis, extraintestinal manifestations,
therapy, clinical relapses, and need of surgical intervention.
RESULTS: Patients homozygous for the risk allele ATG16L1 (T300A) showed a trend
towards switching to a stricturing phenotype during the course of disease
compared to children either homozygous for the wild-type allele or heterozygous
for the ATG16L1 single nucleotide polymorphism (p=0.01). Homozygosity for the
ATG16L1 risk allele was associated with a major recurrence of clinical relapses
and earlier introduction of immunosuppressants (p=0.006 and p=0.04,
respectively). Heterozygosity for the NOD2 rs2066847 allele was associated with
major ileal involvement (p=0.01).
CONCLUSION: In patients carrying the T300A variant, Crohn's disease follows a
more aggressive clinical course.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: The expression of interleukin (IL)-17 is upregulated in
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Since fibroblasts are known to be responsive to
IL-17, they may play a role in the modulation of inflammatory responses in IBD.
Here, the effects of IL-17 on ileum and colon fibroblasts from Crohn's disease
(CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) patients are investigated, as compared to
controls.
METHODS: Fibroblasts were isolated from surgical specimens taken from the tissue 
of 21 CD patients, 5 UC patients, and 14 patients undergoing surgery for
colorectal carcinoma (control). The fibroblasts were cultured with and without
IL-17. We performed mRNA microarray analysis on cultured fibroblasts, isolated
from three CD samples and three control samples. Based on these results, the
expression of IL-17 induced genes was validated in a larger selection of samples 
using qRT-PCR and ELISA.
RESULTS: The mRNA microarray showed that IL-17 induced the expression levels of
various genes in fibroblasts of CD patients and controls, among which NFKBIZ,
CXCL1, and CXCL6 demonstrated the most prominent response. qRT-PCR validated that
IL-17 induced the expression of NFKBIZ significantly (p=0.028) in intestinal
fibroblasts of CD patients. By performing an ELISA, we also discovered that,
following IL-17 stimulation, CXCL1 levels were significantly increased in
fibroblasts from CD patients (p=0.048). IL-17 also stimulated secretion of CXCL6 
in fibroblasts from UC patients (p=0.053).
CONCLUSION: The enhanced expression of IL-17 that is observed in patients with
Crohn's disease could act on intestinal fibroblasts to induce expression of
transcription factor NFKBIZ and proinflammatory chemokine CXCL1. This can have
consequences for fibroblast activity and neutrophil chemotaxis.

AIM: To investigate if the presence of relevant genetic polymorphisms has effect 
on the effectual clearance of bacteria by monocytes and granulocytes in patients 
with Crohn's disease (CD).
METHODS: In this study, we assessed the differential responses in phagocytosis by
measuring the phagocytic activity and the percentage of active phagocytic
monocytes and granulocytes in inflammatory bowel disease patients as well as
healthy controls. As both autophagy related like 1 (ATG16L1) and immunity-related
guanosine triphosphatase gene are autophagy genes associated with CD and more
recently nucleotide-binding ligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) has
been identified as a potent inducer of autophagy we genotyped the patients for
these variants and correlated this to the phagocytic reaction. The genotyping was
done with restriction fragment length polymorphisms analysis and the phagocytosis
was determined with the pHrodo™ Escherichia coli Bioparticles Phagocytosis kit
for flowcytometry.
RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrate that analysis of the monocyte and
granulocyte populations of patients with CD and ulcerative colitis showed a
comparable phagocytic activity (ratio of mean fluorescence intensity) between the
patient groups and the healthy controls. CD patients show a significantly higher 
phagocytic capacity (ratio mean percentage of phagocytic cells) compared to
healthy controls (51.91% ± 2.85% vs 37.67% ± 7.06%, P = 0.05). The extend of
disease was not of influence. However, variants of ATG16L1 (WT: 2.03 ± 0.19 vs
homozygoot variant: 4.38 ± 0.37, P < 0.009) as well as NOD2 (C-ins) (heterozygous
variant: 42.08 ± 2.94 vs homozygous variant: 75.58 ± 4.34 (P = 0.05) are
associated with the phagocytic activity in patients with CD.
CONCLUSION: Monocytes of CD patients show enhanced phagocytosis associated with
the presence of ATG16L1 and NOD2 variants. This could be part of the
pathophysiological mechanism resulting in the disease.

IBD is a spectrum of chronic disorders that constitute an important health
problem worldwide. The hunt for genetic determinants of disease onset and course 
has culminated in the Immunochip project, which has identified >160 loci
containing IBD susceptibility genes. In this Review, we highlight how genetic
association studies have informed our understanding of the pathogenesis of IBD by
focusing research efforts on key pathways involved in innate immunity, autophagy,
lymphocyte differentiation and chemotaxis. Several of these novel genetic markers
and cellular pathways are promising candidates for patient stratification and
therapeutic targeting.

Autonomous Region, Urumqi, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, China.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to study the association between HLA-DRB1 alleles and
anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) among Uyghur and Han patients with 
ulcerative colitis (UC) in China.
METHODS: Altogether 160 UC patients and 466 healthy controls of Uyghur and Han
groups residing in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China were included. 
HLA-DRB1 variants were identified from genomic DNA using polymerase chain
reaction and gene sequencing. Serum ANCA were determined by indirect
immunofluorescence assay.
RESULTS: Among the Uyghur populations, the HLA-DRB1*08 gene frequency was lower
in the UC patients than in the control group (P = 0.012, OR 0.12, 95% CI
0.02-0.91); however, that of HLA-DRB1*13 was much higher in the UC patients than 
in the controls (P = 0.001, OR 4.32, 95% CI 1.92-9.74). In Han patients with UC, 
there was no significant difference in HLA-DRB1 frequency between UC patients and
healthy controls. The positive rate of ANCA in Uyghur patients with UC was
significantly higher than in Han UC patients (P = 0.026), and ANCA positivity was
associated with an increased frequency of HLA-DRB1*13 in Uyghur UC patients, but 
no such difference was observed in the Han patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Genetic polymorphisms of the HLA-DRB1*08 and *13 may contribute to
the clinical heterogeneity of UC between Uyghur and Han UC patients in China. In 
Uyghur UC patients, HLA-DRB1*13 may be correlated with ANCA positivity.

Institute, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York; and ‖VA New York
Harbor Healthcare System, New York, New York.

BACKGROUND: Inflammation during inflammatory bowel disease may alter nutrient
availability to adherent mucosal bacteria and impact their metabolic function.
Microbial metabolites may regulate intestinal CD4 T-cell homeostasis. We
investigated the relationship between inflammation and microbial function by
inferred metagenomics of the mucosal microbiota from colonic pinch biopsies of
patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
METHODS: Paired pinch biopsy samples of known inflammation states were analyzed
from ulcerative colitis (UC) (23), Crohn's disease (CD) (21), and control (24)
subjects by 16S ribosomal sequencing, histopathologic assessment, and flow
cytometry. PICRUSt was used to generate metagenomic data and derive relative
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Pathway abundance information. Leukocytes
were isolated from paired biopsy samples and analyzed by multicolor flow
cytometry. Active inflammation was defined by neutrophil infiltration into the
epithelium.
RESULTS: Carriage of metabolic pathways in the mucosal microbiota was relatively 
stable among patients with inflammatory bowel disease, despite large variations
in individual bacterial community structures. However, microbial function was
significantly altered in inflamed tissue of UC patients, with a reduction in
carbohydrate and nucleotide metabolism in favor of increased lipid and amino acid
metabolism. These differences were not observed in samples from CD patients. In
CD, microbial lipid, carbohydrate, and amino acid metabolism tightly correlated
with the frequency of CD4Foxp3 Tregs, whereas in UC, these pathways correlated
with the frequency of CD4IL-22 (TH22) cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic pathways of the mucosal microbiota in CD do not vary as
much as UC with inflammation state, indicating a more systemic perturbation of
host-bacteria interactions in CD compared with more localized dysfunction in UC.

BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important posttranscriptional regulators of
gene expression. The precise role of miRNAs in ulcerative colitis (UC) is not
completely understood. The purpose of this study was to identify miRNAs that are 
induced in patients with active UC and to assess the effect of miR-155 on
improving intestinal inflammation.
METHODS: The miRNA profiles in patients with active UC (n = 20) and healthy
subjects (n = 16) were examined using miRNA microarrays. miR-155 upregulation was
confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. Regulation of the target gene FOXO3a expression
by miR-155 was assessed using luciferase reporter construct assays and miR-155
mimic or inhibitor transfections. The effects of FOXO3a or miR-155 on IκBα or
IL-8 were detected by Western blot or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in HT29
cells, respectively.
RESULTS: We identified 68 miRNAs that were differentially expressed (33
upregulated and 35 downregulated) in patients with active UC compared with
healthy controls. One of the upregulated miRNAs in the UC tissue was miR-155
(1.22-fold, P < 0.03), which plays a key role in the regulation of inflammatory
pathways. In patients with active UC, miR-155 was significantly upregulated, and 
the expression of FOXO3a dramatically decreased. Luciferase reporter assays
demonstrated that miR-155 directly targets FOXO3a and affects the protein
expression of FOXO3a in HT29 cells. Moreover, silenced FOXO3a and the
overexpression of miR-155 increased the levels of IL-8 in TNF-α-treated HT29
cells by suppressing the inhibitory IκBα.
CONCLUSIONS: miR-155 appears to play a role in the intestinal inflammation of
patients with active UC by downregulating the expression of FOXO3a. This process 
may activate the nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathway.

Crohn's disease (CD) is a multifactorial pathology associated with the presence
of adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) and NLRP3 polymorphic variants. The 
presence of intracellular E. coli in other intestinal pathologies (OIP) and the
role of NLRP3-inflammasome in the immune response activated by these bacteria
have not been investigated. In this study, we sought to characterize
intracellular strains isolated from patients with CD, ulcerative colitis (UC) and
OIP, and analyze NLRP3-inflammasome role in the immune response and bactericidal 
activity induced in macrophages exposed to invasive bacteria. For this,
intracellular E. coli isolation from ileal biopsies, using gentamicin-protection 
assay, revealed a prevalence and CFU/biopsy of E. coli higher in biopsies from
CD, UC and OIP patients than in controls. To characterize bacterial isolates,
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns, virulence genes, serogroup and 
phylogenetic group were analyzed. We found out that bacteria isolated from a
given patient were closely related and shared virulence factors; however, strains
from different patients were genetically heterogeneous. AIEC characteristics in
isolated strains, such as invasive and replicative properties, were assessed in
epithelial cells and macrophages, respectively. Some strains from CD and UC
demonstrated AIEC properties, but not strains from OIP. Furthermore, the role of 
NLRP3 in pro-inflammatory cytokines production and bacterial elimination was
determined in macrophages. E. coli strains induced IL-1β through NLRP3-dependent 
mechanism; however, their elimination by macrophages was independent of NLRP3.
Invasiveness of intracellular E. coli strains into the intestinal mucosa and
IL-1β production may contribute to CD and UC pathogenesis.

BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) results from an inappropriate
inflammatory response in which genetic, immune, and environmental factors all
play important roles. Recently, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the
CD24 gene have been associated with the development of several autoimmune
diseases.
AIM: To evaluate whether CD24 SNPs, are associated with risk of ulcerative
colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD).
METHODS: The CD24 polymorphisms C170T (rs8734), TG1527del (rs3838646), A1626G
(rs1058881), and A1056G (rs1058818) were assessed in a case-control study of an
Israeli cohort comprising 117 IBD patients and 105 age and gender-matched healthy
controls. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis was performed 
using BstX1, Bsr1, Mfe1, and BstU1 restriction enzymes. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CI) were estimated by logistic regression models.
RESULTS: Carriers of the C170T SNP were at increased risk of IBD (OR=3.022, 95%
CI: 1.748-5.223, p=0.001), UC (OR=3.002, 95% CI: 1.661-5.427, p=0.001) and CD
(OR=3.077, 95% CI: 1.334-7.095, p=0.008). Carrying the A1626G and A1056G SNPs was
found to be a risk factor for IBD (OR=2.460, 95% CI: 1.420-4.259, p=0.001 and
OR=1.856, 95% CI: 1.011-3.405, p=0.01), UC (OR=2.218, 95% CI: 1.207-4.075, p=0.01
and OR=1.944, 95% CI: 0.995-3.798, p=0.01) but not for CD (p=0.086 and p=0.299). 
The A1626G and TG1527del were found to be associated with younger age of IBD
onset (p=0.022 and p=0.027, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The CD24 C170T polymorphism is associated with IBD risk. The A1626G 
and A1056G SNPs might be associated only with UC risk. These findings suggest
CD24 as a new genetic susceptibility factor, with clinical implications in the
prediction of IBD prognosis and therapy.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore whether the cytotoxic T
lymphocyte associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) polymorphisms are associated with
susceptibility to ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD).
METHODS: The authors conducted a meta-analysis on associations between CTLA-4 +49
A/G, -318 C/T, CT60 A/G polymorphisms, and (AT)n repeat in the 3' untranslated
region (UTR) and UC and CD susceptibility.
RESULTS: A total of 15 comparison studies were considered in our meta-analysis.
Meta-analysis revealed no association between UC and the CTLA-4 +49 G and CTLA-4 
-318 T alleles in all subjects (OR=0.982, 95% CI=0.851-1.1339, p=0.804; OR=0.500,
95% CI=0.223-1.124, p=0.094). No association was found between UC and the CTLA-4 
CT60 A/G polymorphism in Europeans. However, a significant association was
observed between the longer allele (⩾118bp) of the (AT)n and UC in Asian
population (OR=6.073, 95% CI=4.246-8.684, p=1.0×10(-9)). Meta-analysis of the
CTLA-4 +49 A/G, -318 C/T, CT60 A/G polymorphisms showed no association with CD.
CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis demonstrates that the CTLA-4 (AT)n repeat in 3'
UTR may be associated with susceptibility to UC in Asians, while no association
was found between the CTLA-4 +49 A/G, -318 C/T, and CD60 A/G polymorphism and
susceptibility to UC and CD.

VGX-1027 [(S,R)-3-phenyl-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxasole acetic acid] is a small molecule
compound with immunomodulatory properties, which favourably influences the
development of immuno-inflammatory and autoimmune diseases in different animal
models such as type 1 diabetes mellitus, pleurisy, rheumatoid arthritis and
inflammatory bowel disease. However, the precise mechanism of action of VGX-1027 
remains to be ascertained. With this aim, we have studied the immunomodulatory
effects of VGX-1027 in vitro, using a genome-wide oligonucleotide microarray
approach, and in vivo, using the NZB/NZW F1 model of systemic lupus
erythematosus. Microarray data revealed that the administration of VGX-1027
profoundly affected the immune response to exogenous antigens, by modulating the 
expression of genes that are primarily involved in antigen processing and
presentation as well as genes that regulate immune activation. When administered 
in vivo VGX-1027 ameliorated the course of the disease in the NZB/NZW F1 mice,
which correlated with higher per cent survival and improved clinical and
histopathological signs. The data presented herein support the theory that
VGX-1027 modulates immunity, probably by inhibiting inflammatory antigen
presentation and so limiting immune cell expansion.

Detection of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis in patients with
Crohn's disease is unrelated to the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms
rs2241880 (ATG16L1) and rs10045431 (IL12B).

Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) has been controversially
linked with Crohn's disease (CD). Detection of MAP in CD has been highly
variable, and one explanation might be the genetic heterogeneity of this
syndrome. Many of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked with CD are
contained within genes that are associated with bacterial handling in general,
and some are specifically implicated in susceptibility to mycobacterial disease. 
We tested a cohort of IBD patients (n = 149) to determine whether the presence of
MAP was associated with a selection of these SNPs. Blood samples from CD patients
(n = 84), ulcerative colitis (UC, n = 65) patients and healthy controls (n = 55) 
were examined for the presence of MAP and SNPs in ATG16L1, IL12B, NOD2/CARD15,
NKx2-3, IL23R and IRGM. Statistical analysis was then used to determine whether
there was any association between the presence of MAP and these SNPs. MAP,
rs2241880 (ATG16L1) and rs10045431 (IL12B) were found to be significantly
associated with CD. The presence of MAP was not related to the status of the SNPs
in ATG16L1 or IL12B. We have found no evidence for the contribution of these SNPs
to the presence of MAP in CD patients.

PURPOSE: Loss-of-function mutations in IL10 and IL10R cause very early onset
inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD). Here, we investigated the molecular
pathomechanism of a novel intronic IL10RA mutation and describe a new therapeutic
approach of T cell replete haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
(HSCT).
METHODS: Clinical data were collected by chart review. Genotypes of IL10 and
IL10R genes were determined by Sanger sequencing. Expression and function of
mutated IL-10R1 were assessed by quantitative PCR, Western blot analysis,
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, confocal microscopy, and flow cytometry.
RESULTS: We identified a novel homozygous point mutation in intron 3 of the
IL10RA (c.368-10C > G) in three related children with VEO-IBD. Bioinformatical
analysis predicted an additional 3' splice site created by the mutation.
Quantitative PCR analysis showed normal mRNA expression of mutated IL10RA.
Sequencing of the patient's cDNA revealed an insertion of the last nine
nucleotides of intron 3 as a result of aberrant splicing. Structure-based
modeling suggested misfolding of mutated IL-10R1. Western blot analysis
demonstrated a different N-linked glycosylation pattern of mutated protein.
Immunofluorescence and FACS analysis revealed impaired expression of mutated
IL-10R1 at the plasma membrane. In the absence of HLA-identical donors, T cell
replete haploidentical HSCT was successfully performed in two patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings expand the spectrum of IL10R mutations in VEO-IBD and
emphasize the need for genetic diagnosis of mutations in conserved non-coding
sequences of candidate genes. Transplantation of haploidentical stem cells
represents a curative therapy in IL-10R-deficient patients, but may be
complicated by non-engraftment.

Inflammatory bowel diseases are chronic inflammatory disorders of multiple organ 
systems, primarily involving the gut, with chronic relapsing and remitting
course. Musculoskeletal involvement is the most common extraintestinal
manifestation. Distinct cell-mediated and humoral immunopathophysiological
mechanisms have been identified underlying gut and joint inflammation in patients
with inflammatory bowel disease and arthritis. Genetic polymorphisms in genes
coding for NOD2 and IL12/IL23 complex lead to impaired antigenic handling in the 
gut and local immune dysregulation. The gut-synovial axis hypothesis implicates
both environmental and host factors acting as triggers to initiate inflammation
in genetically predisposed individuals, leading to priming of Th1 and Th17
lymphocytes in the gut and subsequent homing to the synovial tissue. Similar to
gut, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-mediated cell
lysis may also contribute to the joint damage. Involvement of peripheral joints
occurs in 2 distinct manners, one being oligoarticular asymmetric arthritis
associated with active disease and the other being polyarticular symmetric
involvement of small joints. The axial involvement may include asymptomatic
sacroiliitis, inflammatory back pain, and ankylosing spondylitis, running an
independent clinical course. Noninflammatory involvement of the musculoskeletal
system may present as osteopenia, osteonecrosis, fibromyalgia, or myopathies,
leading to significant impact on quality of life.

Arylamine N-acetyltransferases (NATs) are polymorphic drug-metabolizing enzymes, 
acetylating arylamine carcinogens and drugs including hydralazine and
sulphonamides. The slow NAT phenotype increases susceptibility to hydralazine and
isoniazid toxicity and to occupational bladder cancer. The two polymorphic human 
NAT loci show linkage disequilibrium. All mammalian Nat genes have an intronless 
open reading frame and non-coding exons. The human gene products NAT1 and NAT2
have distinct substrate specificities: NAT2 acetylates hydralazine and human NAT1
acetylates p-aminosalicylate (p-AS) and the folate catabolite
para-aminobenzoylglutamate (p-abaglu). Human NAT2 is mainly in liver and gut.
Human NAT1 and its murine homologue are in many adult tissues and in early
embryos. Human NAT1 is strongly expressed in oestrogen receptor-positive breast
cancer and may contribute to folate and acetyl CoA homeostasis. NAT enzymes act
through a catalytic triad of Cys, His and Asp with the architecture of the active
site-modulating specificity. Polymorphisms may cause unfolded protein. The
C-terminus helps bind acetyl CoA and differs among NATs including prokaryotic
homologues. NAT in Salmonella typhimurium supports carcinogen activation and NAT 
in mycobacteria metabolizes isoniazid with polymorphism a minor factor in
isoniazid resistance. Importantly, nat is in a gene cluster essential for
Mycobacterium tuberculosis survival inside macrophages. NAT inhibitors are a
starting point for novel anti-tuberculosis drugs. Human NAT1-specific inhibitors 
may act in biomarker detection in breast cancer and in cancer therapy. NAT
inhibitors for co-administration with 5-aminosalicylate (5-AS) in inflammatory
bowel disease has prompted ongoing investigations of azoreductases in gut
bacteria which release 5-AS from prodrugs including balsalazide.

OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to determine whether or not specific microorganisms were
transported selectively to lymph nodes in Crohn's disease (CD) by comparing node 
and mucosal microbial communities in patients and controls. We also sought
evidence of dysbiosis and bacterial translocation.
DESIGN: Lymph nodes, and involved and uninvolved mucosal samples were obtained
from resections of 58 patients (29 CD, eight 'other inflammatory bowel disease'
(IBD) and 21 non-IBD). Universal primers targeting V1-V3 regions of bacterial 16S
rRNA genes were used to amplify bacterial DNA and amplicons sequenced using high 
throughput sequencing. 20 patients (eight CD (28%), two other IBD (25%) and 10
non-IBD (48%)) had PCR positive nodes.
RESULTS: All samples from an individual were similar: there was no evidence of
selective concentration of any microorganism in nodes. No specific microorganism 
was present in the nodes of all CD samples. Escherichia/Shigella were common in
all patient groups but patients with ileal CD had a greater proportion of
Escherichia coli reads in their nodes than other CD patients (p=0.0475).
Campylobacter, Helicobacter and Yersinia were uncommon; Mycobacterium and
Listeria were not detected. Dysbiosis was present in all groups but shifts were
specific and no common pattern emerged.
CONCLUSIONS: It is unlikely that a single bacterium perpetuates inflammation in
late stage CD; dysbiosis was common and we found no evidence of increased
bacterial translocation. We believe that future studies should focus on early
disease and viable bacteria in nodes, aphthous ulcers and granulomas, as they may
be more relevant in the initiation of inflammation in CD.

BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease is a chronic inflammatory condition of the
gastrointestinal tract. It can be aggravated by stress, like sleep deprivation,
and improved by anti-inflammatory agents, like melatonin. We aimed to investigate
the effects of sleep deprivation and melatonin on inflammation. We also
investigated genes regulated by sleep deprivation and melatonin.
METHODS: In the 2% DSS induced colitis mice model, sleep deprivation was induced 
using modified multiple platform water bath. Melatonin was injected after
induction of colitis and colitis with sleep deprivation. Also mRNA was isolated
from the colon of mice and analyzed via microarray and real-time PCR.
RESULTS: Sleep deprivation induced reduction of body weight, and it was difficult
for half of the mice to survive. Sleep deprivation aggravated, and melatonin
attenuated the severity of colitis. In microarrays and real-time PCR of mice
colon tissues, mRNA of adiponectin and aquaporin 8 were downregulated by sleep
deprivation and upregulated by melatonin. However, mRNA of E2F transcription
factor (E2F2) and histocompatibility class II antigen A, beta 1 (H2-Ab1) were
upregulated by sleep deprivation and downregulated by melatonin.
CONCLUSION: Melatonin improves and sleep deprivation aggravates inflammation of
colitis in mice. Adiponectin, aquaporin 8, E2F2 and H2-Ab1 may be involved in the
inflammatory change aggravated by sleep deprivation and attenuated by melatonin.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Very early onset inflammatory bowel diseases (VEOIBD),
including infant disorders, are a diverse group of diseases found in children
younger than 6 years of age. They have been associated with several gene
variants. Our aim was to identify the genes that cause VEOIBD.
METHODS: We performed whole exome sequencing of DNA from 1 infant with severe
enterocolitis and her parents. Candidate gene mutations were validated in 40
pediatric patients and functional studies were carried out using intestinal
samples and human intestinal cell lines.
RESULTS: We identified compound heterozygote mutations in the Tetratricopeptide
repeat domain 7 (TTC7A) gene in an infant from non-consanguineous parents with
severe exfoliative apoptotic enterocolitis; we also detected TTC7A mutations in 2
unrelated families, each with 2 affected siblings. TTC7A interacts with EFR3
homolog B to regulate phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase at the plasma membrane.
Functional studies demonstrated that TTC7A is expressed in human enterocytes. The
mutations we identified in TTC7A result in either mislocalization or reduced
expression of TTC7A. Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase was found to
co-immunoprecipitate with TTC7A; the identified TTC7A mutations reduced this
binding. Knockdown of TTC7A in human intestinal-like cell lines reduced their
adhesion, increased apoptosis, and decreased production of phosphatidylinositol
4-phosphate.
CONCLUSIONS: In a genetic analysis, we identified loss of function mutations in
TTC7A in 5 infants with VEOIBD. Functional studies demonstrated that the
mutations cause defects in enterocytes and T cells that lead to severe apoptotic 
enterocolitis. Defects in the phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase-TTC7A-EFR3 homolog B 
pathway are involved in the pathogenesis of VEOIBD.

Increased dietary ratios of ω6/ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have been
implicated in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD), but epidemiologic data
are limited. We investigated whether variants of genes that control
polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism (CYP4F3, FADS1, and FADS2), along with the 
dietary ratio of ω6/ω3, confers susceptibility to CD. Based on data from 182
children newly diagnosed with CD and 250 controls, we found that children who
consumed a higher dietary ratio of ω6/ω3 were susceptible for CD if they were
also carriers of specific variants of CYP4F3 and FADS2 genes. Our findings
implicate diet-gene interactions in the pathogenesis of CD.

Guilt by rewiring: gene prioritization through network rewiring in genome wide
association studies.

Although Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have identified many
susceptibility loci for common diseases, they only explain a small portion of
heritability. It is challenging to identify the remaining disease loci because
their association signals are likely weak and difficult to identify among
millions of candidates. One potentially useful direction to increase statistical 
power is to incorporate functional genomics information, especially gene
expression networks, to prioritize GWAS signals. Most current methods utilizing
network information to prioritize disease genes are based on the 'guilt by
association' principle, in which networks are treated as static, and
disease-associated genes are assumed to locate closer with each other than random
pairs in the network. In contrast, we propose a novel 'guilt by rewiring'
principle. Studying the dynamics of gene networks between controls and patients, 
this principle assumes that disease genes more likely undergo rewiring in
patients, whereas most of the network remains unaffected in disease condition. To
demonstrate this principle, we consider the changes of co-expression networks in 
Crohn's disease patients and controls, and how network dynamics reveals
information on disease associations. Our results demonstrate that network
rewiring is abundant in the immune system, and disease-associated genes are more 
likely to be rewired in patients. To integrate this network rewiring feature and 
GWAS signals, we propose to use the Markov random field framework to integrate
network information to prioritize genes. Applications in Crohn's disease and
Parkinson's disease show that this framework leads to more replicable results,
and implicates potentially disease-associated pathways.

Although a causing viral infectious agent remains untraceable in Crohn's disease,
most recent genome-wide association studies have linked the FUT2 W143X mutation
(resulting in asymptomatic norovirus infection) with the pathogenesis of Crohn's 
ileitis and with vitamin B12 deficiency (i.e., a known risk factor for Crohn's
disease with ileal involvement). In line with these findings, host variations in 
additional genes involved in host response to norovirus infection (such as
ATG16L1 and NOD2) predispose humans to Crohn's ileitis. One may therefore presume
that asymptomatic norovirus infection may contribute to disruption of the
stability of the gut microbiota leading to Crohn's ileitis. These paradigms
highlight not only the need to revisit the potential transmissibility of Crohn's 
disease, but also potential safety issues of forthcoming clinical trials on human
probiotic infusions in Crohn's ileitis by rigorous donors screening program.

The expanding knowledge of the role of genetic variants involved in the
susceptibility to IBD heralds an era of disease categorization beyond Crohn's
disease and ulcerative colitis. A more robust molecular definition of the
spectrum of IBD subtypes is likely to be based on specific molecular pathways
that determine not only disease susceptibility but also disease characteristics
such as location, natural history and therapeutic response. Evolving diagnostic
panels for IBD will include clinical variables and genetic markers as well as
other indicators of gene function and interaction with environmental factors,
such as the microbiome. Multimodal algorithms that combine clinical, serologic
and genetic information are likely to be useful in predicting disease course.
Variation in IBD-susceptibility and drug-related pathway genes seems to influence
the response to anti-TNF therapy. Furthermore, gene expression signatures and
composite models have both shown promise as predictors of therapeutic response.
Ultimately, models based on combinations of genotype and gene expression data
with clinical, biochemical, serological, and microbiome data for clinically
meaningful subgroups of patients should permit the development of tools for
individualized risk stratification and treatment selection.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: The contribution of genetic factors to the pathogenesis of
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been established by twin,
targeted-sequencing, and genome-wide association studies. These studies
identified many risk loci, and research is underway to identify causal variants. 
These studies have focused mainly on protein-coding genes. We investigated other 
functional elements in the human genome, such as regulatory regions.
METHODS: Using acetylated histone 3 lysine 27 chromatin immunoprecipitation and
sequencing, we identified tens of thousands of potential regulatory regions that 
are active in intestinal epithelium (primary intestinal crypts and cultured
organoids) isolated from resected material and from biopsies collected during
ileo-colonoscopies and immune cells (monocytes, macrophages, CD34(+), CD4(+), and
CD8(+)). We correlated these regions with susceptibility loci for IBD.
RESULTS: We have generated acetylated histone 3 lysine 27 profiles from primary
intestinal epithelium and cultured organoids, which we have made publically
available. We found that 45 of 163 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
associated with IBD overlap specifically with active regulatory elements. In
addition, by taking strong linkage disequilibrium into account, another 47
IBD-associated SNPs colocalized with active regulatory elements through other
SNPs in their vicinity. Altogether, 92 of 163 IBD-associated SNPs correlated with
distinct active regulatory elements-a frequency 2.5- to 3.5-fold greater than
that expected from random sampling. The variations in these SNPs often create or 
disrupt known binding motifs; they might affect the binding of transcriptional
regulators to alter expression of regulated genes.
CONCLUSIONS: In addition to variants in protein coding genes, variants in
noncoding DNA regulatory regions that are active in intestinal epithelium and
immune cells are potentially involved in the pathogenesis of IBD.

CXCL5 is a member of CXC chemokines with neutrophilic chemoattractant and
pro-angiogenic properties, which has been implicated in the pathological
angiogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel diseases. Since
aberrant angiogenesis is also involved in the developmental process of systemic
sclerosis (SSc), we herein measured serum CXCL5 levels in 63 SSc and 18 healthy
subjects and investigated their clinical significance and the mechanism
explaining altered expression of CXCL5 in SSc. Serum CXCL5 levels were
significantly lower in SSc patients than in healthy subjects. In diffuse
cutaneous SSc (dcSSc), serum CXCL5 levels were uniformly decreased in early stage
(<1 year) and positively correlated with disease duration in patients with
disease duration of <6 years. In non-early stage dcSSc (≥1 year), decreased serum
CXCL5 levels were linked to the development of digital ulcers. Consistently, the 
expression levels of CXCL5 proteins were decreased in dermal blood vessels of
early stage dcSSc. Importantly, Fli1 bound to the CXCL5 promoter and its gene
silencing significantly suppressed the CXCL5 mRNA expression in human dermal
microvascular endothelial cells. Furthermore, endothelial cell-specific Fli1
knockout mice, an animal model of SSc vasculopathy, exhibited decreased CXCL5
expression in dermal blood vessels. Collectively, these results indicate that
CXCL5 is a member of angiogenesis-related genes, whose expression is suppressed
at least partially due to Fli1 deficiency in SSc endothelial cells. Since Fli1
deficiency is deeply related to aberrant angiogenesis in SSc, it is plausible
that serum CXCL5 levels inversely reflect the severity of SSc vasculopathy.

colitis (UC) associated loci. The role of genetic factors in clinical practice is
not clearly defined. The relevance of genetic variants to disease pathogenesis is
still uncertain because of not characterized gene-gene and gene-environment
interactions. We examined the predictive value of combining the 133 UC risk loci 
with genetic interactions in an ongoing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) GWAS.
The Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium (WTCCC) IBD GWAS was used as a
replication cohort. We applied logic regression (LR), a novel adaptive regression
methodology, to search for high-order interactions. Exploratory genotype
correlations with UC sub-phenotypes [extent of disease, need of surgery, age of
onset, extra-intestinal manifestations and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)] 
were conducted. The combination of 133 UC loci yielded good UC risk
predictability [area under the curve (AUC) of 0.86]. A higher cumulative allele
score predicted higher UC risk. Through LR, several lines of evidence for genetic
interactions were identified and successfully replicated in the WTCCC cohort. The
genetic interactions combined with the gene-smoking interaction significantly
improved predictability in the model (AUC, from 0.86 to 0.89, P = 3.26E-05).
Explained UC variance increased from 37 to 42 % after adding the interaction
terms. A within case analysis found suggested genetic association with PSC. Our
study demonstrates that the LR methodology allows the identification and
replication of high-order genetic interactions in UC GWAS datasets. UC risk can
be predicted by a 133 loci and improved by adding gene-gene and gene-environment 
interactions.

OBJECTIVES: The findings of a previous multigene study indicated that the
expression of a panel of seven specific genes had strong differential power
regarding inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) versus non-IBD, as well as ulcerative 
colitis (UC) versus Crohn's disease (CD). This prospective confirmatory study
based on an independent patient cohort from a national Danish IBD centre was
conducted in an attempt to verify these earlier observations.
DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 119 patients were included in the
study (CD, UC and controls). Three mucosal biopsies were retrieved from the left 
side of the colon of each patient. RNA was extracted, and RT-PCR was performed to
retain expression profiles from the seven selected genes. Expression data from
the training set (18 CD, 20 UC and 20 controls) were used to build a
classification model, using quadratic discriminant analysis, and data from the
test set (20 CD, 21 UC and 20 controls) were used to test the validity of the
model.
RESULTS: The present investigation did not confirm the previous observation that 
a panel of seven specific genes is able to distinguish between patients with CD
and UC, whereas the discriminative power for IBD versus control subjects was
substantiated.
CONCLUSION: Our results fail to demonstrate that the previously identified
seven-gene classification model is able to discriminate between CD and UC but
suggest that the gene panel merely discriminates between inflamed and noninflamed
colonic tissue. Thus, a reliable and simple diagnostic tool is still warranted
for optimal diagnosis and treatment of patients with IBD, especially the subgroup
with unclassified disease.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the risk of new or recurrent cancer among patients with IBD
and previous cancer, exposed or not to immunosuppressants.
DESIGN: Among the 17 047 patients of the CESAME prospective observational cohort 
who were enrolled from May 2004 to June 2005, and followed-up until December
2007, we identified 405 patients with cancer diagnosed previous to study entry.
We calculated the rates of incident cancer in patients with or without previous
cancer, and we assessed by survival analysis and nested case-control study the
impact of immunosuppressants on the risk of incident new or recurrent cancer in
patients with previous cancer.
RESULTS: The rate of incident cancer was 21.1/1000 patient-years (PY) and
6.1/1000 PY in patients with and without previous cancer, respectively. The
multivariate-adjusted HR of incident cancer between patients with and without
previous cancer was 1.9 (95% CI 1.2 to 3.0, p=0.003). Among patients with
previous cancer, the rates of new and recurrent cancers were, respectively,
13.2/1000 PY and 6.0/1000 PY in the 312 patients who were not taking
immunosuppressant at the time of study entry, and 23.1/1000 PY and 3.9/1000 PY in
the 93 patients treated with immunosuppressants at study entry. There was no
significant association between the exposure to immunosuppressants and the risk
of new or recurrent cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBD with a history of cancer are at increased risk of 
developing any (new or recurrent) cancer, with a predominant incidence of new
cancers. Treatment with immunosuppressants has no overall major impact per se on 
this risk.

Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) are proinflammatory
cytokines that play a critical role in inflammatory bowel disease, as well as in 
colorectal tumorigenesis. We hypothesize that these cytokines modulate the
expression and thus activity of the vitamin D system in colonic epithelial cells.
We treated the colon cancer cell line COGA-1A for 6, 12, and 24h with
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-D3), IL-6, TNFα, and with combinations of these
compounds. Using quantitative RT-PCR, we analyzed mRNA expression of genes
activating and catabolizing 1,25-D3 (1α-hydroxylase (CYP27B1), 24-hydroxylase
(CYP24A1)), expression of several vitamin D target genes, as well as expression
of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase. As
expected, treatment with 1,25-D3 resulted in an upregulation of CYP24A1, whereas 
expression of CYP27B1 was not affected. Treatment with TNFα and IL-6 led to
decreased expression of the vitamin D activating enzyme CYP27B1. The strong
inflammatory property of TNFα was mirrored by its activation of COX-2 and
inhibition of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) catabolism. Interestingly, expression of
the calcium ion channel TRPV6 was markedly decreased by TNFα. We conclude from
these results that the presence of proinflammatory cytokines might impair
activation of 1,25-D3, limiting its anti-inflammatory action. This article is
part of a Special Issue entitled '16th Vitamin D Workshop'.

We investigated the effects of host diet on the intestinal persistence and gene
expression of Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 in healthy and health-compromised,
2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-treated mice. Mice fed either a
low-fat chow diet (CD) or high fat and sucrose Western diet (WD) received 10(9)
L. plantarum WCFS1 cells for five consecutive days. Lactobacillus plantarum
persistence was 10- to 100-fold greater in the intestines of WD-fed compared with
CD-fed mice. TNBS, an intestinal irritant that induces the development of
inflammatory bowel disease-like symptoms, resulted in up to a 10(4) -fold
increase in L. plantarum survival in the digestive tract relative to healthy
animals. Expression levels of 12 metabolic and gut-inducible L. plantarum genes
were differentially affected by diet and TNBS administration. Pyrosequencing of
16S rRNA transcripts from the indigenous intestinal microbiota showed that WD
resulted in significant reductions in proportions of metabolically active
indigenous Lactobacillus species and increases in the Desulfovibrionaceae family.
Feeding L. plantarum WCFS1 resulted in lower levels of colitis and higher
concentrations of colonic IL-10 and IL-12 in WD and not CD-fed mice. Interactions
between probiotics, nutritional components and the intestinal bacteria should be 
considered when examining for probiotic-mediated effects and elucidating
mechanisms of probiotic function in the mammalian gut.

Inflammatory bowel diseases: from pathogenesis to laboratory testing.

Basso D, Zambon CF, Plebani M.

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), which comprise the two major clinical
subtypes, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, incur high morbidity and
potential mortality. The present study reviews data on the pathogenesis and
diagnosis of IBDs. The pathogenesis depends on complex interactions between
susceptibility genes, environmental factors, and innate and adaptive immunity,
the understanding of which is crucial to discovering novel laboratory biomarkers.
Traditional laboratory tests for the diagnosis, prognosis and assessment of
disease activity of IBDs are reported on, and the biochemical properties,
pre-analytical and analytical aspects and clinical utility of the fecal markers
lactoferrin and calprotectin are described. DNA testing and established (ASCA and
pANCA) and emerging (ACCA, ALCA, AMCA, OmpC) serum markers are described; a
further aspect to be addressed is the clinical use of pharmacogenetics for the
treatment of IBDs.

OBJECTIVE: Altered microbiota composition, changes in immune responses and
impaired intestinal barrier functions are observed in IBD. Most of these features
are controlled by proteases and their inhibitors to maintain gut homeostasis.
Unrestrained or excessive proteolysis can lead to pathological gastrointestinal
conditions. The aim was to validate the identified protease IBD candidates from a
previously performed systematic review through a genetic association study and
functional follow-up.
DESIGN: We performed a genetic association study in a large multicentre cohort of
patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and UC from five European IBD referral centres
in a total of 2320 CD patients, 2112 UC patients and 1796 healthy controls.
Subsequently, we did an extensive functional assessment of the candidate genes to
explore their causality in IBD pathogenesis.
RESULTS: Ten single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in four genes were
significantly associated with CD: CYLD, USP40, APEH and USP3. CYLD was the most
significant gene with the intronically located rs12324931 the strongest
associated SNP (p(FDR)=1.74e-17, OR=2.24 (1.83 to 2.74)). Five SNPs in four genes
were significantly associated with UC: USP40, APEH, DAG1 and USP3. CYLD, as well 
as some of the other associated genes, is part of the ubiquitin proteasome system
(UPS). We therefore determined if the IBD-associated adherent-invasive
Escherichia coli (AIEC) can modulate the UPS functioning. Infection of intestinal
epithelial cells with the AIEC LF82 reference strain modulated the UPS turnover
by reducing poly-ubiquitin conjugate accumulation, increasing 26S proteasome
activities and decreasing protein levels of the NF-κB regulator CYLD. This
resulted in IκB-α degradation and NF-κB activation. This activity was very
important for the pathogenicity of AIEC since decreased CYLD resulted in
increased ability of AIEC LF82 to replicate intracellularly.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal the UPS, and CYLD specifically, as an important
contributor to IBD pathogenesis, which is favoured by both genetic and microbial 
factors.

The possible association of three DEFB1 gene polymorphisms with susceptibility to
develop ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) was investigated in
Brazilian patients and controls. Although a clear and strong association between 
functional 5'-UTR DEFB1 SNPs and susceptibility/protection to IBDs cannot be
drawn, our results suggest a possible involvement of DEFB1 gene in inflammatory
bowel diseases, especially with the colonic localization of Crohn's disease.

OBJECTIVE: Emerging evidence suggests that microRNA (miRNA)-mediated gene
regulation influences a variety of autoimmune disease processes, including
Crohn's disease (CD), but the biological function of miRNAs in CD remains
unclear. We examine miRNA level in colon tissues and study the potential
functions of miRNAs that regulate pathological genes during the inflammation
process.
DESIGN: miRNA levels were assayed in the inflamed colon of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene 
sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced and IL-10 knockout (KO) chronic colitis mice and CD 
patients by microarray or qRT-PCR. The influence of differently expressed miR-141
on its putative target genes, CXCL12β, and leukocyte migration was investigated
in colonic epithelia cells, colitis models and CD patients. The role of miR-141
was further studied in the experimental colitis mice by intracolonic
administration of miR-141 precursors or inhibitors.
RESULTS: An inverse correlation between miR-141 and CXCL12β/total-CXCL12 was
observed predominantly in the epithelial cells of the inflamed colons from
colitic mice and CD patients. Further study demonstrated that miR-141 directly
regulated CXCL12β expression and CXCL12β-mediated leukocyte migration.
Upregulation or downregulation of miR-141 in the TNBS-induced or IL-10 KO colitic
colon regulated leukocyte infiltration and alleviated or aggravated experimental 
colitis, respectively. Additionally, colonic overexpression of CXCL12β abolished 
the therapeutic effect of miR-141 in TNBS-induced colitis.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the pathway of miR-141 targeting CXCL12β is a
possible mechanism underlying inflammatory cell trafficking during colonic
inflammation process. Inhibiting colonic CXCL12β expression and blocking colonic 
immune cell recruitment by using miRNA precursors represents a promising approach
that may be valuable for CD treatment.

BACKGROUND: There are substantial differences in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
genetics depending on the populations examined. We aimed to identify Japanese
population-specific or true culprit susceptibility genes through a meta-analysis 
of past genetic studies of Japanese IBD.
METHODS: For this study, we reviewed 2,703 articles. The review process consisted
of three screening stages: we initially searched for relevant studies and then
relevant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Finally, we adjusted them for
the meta-analysis. To maximize our chances of analysis, we introduced proxy SNPs 
during the first stage. To minimize publication bias, no significant SNPs and
solitary SNPs without pairs were combined to be reconsidered during the third
stage. Additionally, two SNPs were newly genotyped. Finally, we conducted a
meta-analysis of 37 published studies in 50 SNPs located at 22 loci corresponding
to the total number of 4,853 Crohn's disease (CD), 5,612 ulcerative colitis (UC) 
patients, and 14,239 healthy controls.
RESULTS: We confirmed that the NKX2-3 polymorphism is associated with common
susceptibility to IBD and that HLA-DRB1*0450 alleles increase susceptibility to
CD but reduce risk for UC while HLA-DRB1*1502 alleles increase susceptibility to 
UC but reduce CD risk. Moreover, we found individual disease risk loci: TNFSF15
and TNFα to CD and HLA-B*5201, and NFKBIL1 to UC. The genetic risk of HLA was
substantially high (odds ratios ranged from 1.54 to 2.69) while that of common
susceptibility loci to IBD was modest (odds ratio ranged from 1.13 to 1.24).
CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that Japanese IBD susceptibility loci identified by
the meta-analysis are closely associated with the HLA regions.

A model for family-based case-control studies of genetic imprinting and
epistasis.

Li X, Sui Y, Liu T, Wang J, Li Y, Lin Z, Hegarty J, Koltun WA, Wang Z, Wu R.

Genetic imprinting, or called the parent-of-origin effect, has been recognized to
play an important role in the formation and pathogenesis of human diseases.
Although the epigenetic mechanisms that establish genetic imprinting have been a 
focus of many genetic studies, our knowledge about the number of imprinting genes
and their chromosomal locations and interactions with other genes is still
scarce, limiting precise inference of the genetic architecture of complex
diseases. In this article, we present a statistical model for testing and
estimating the effects of genetic imprinting on complex diseases using a commonly
used case-control design with family structure. For each subject sampled from a
case and control population, we not only genotype its own single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) but also collect its parents' genotypes. By tracing the
transmission pattern of SNP alleles from parental to offspring generation, the
model allows the characterization of genetic imprinting effects based on Pearson 
tests of a 2 × 2 contingency table. The model is expanded to test the
interactions between imprinting effects and additive, dominant and epistatic
effects in a complex web of genetic interactions. Statistical properties of the
model are investigated, and its practical usefulness is validated by a real data 
analysis. The model will provide a useful tool for genome-wide association
studies aimed to elucidate the picture of genetic control over complex human
diseases.

OBJECTIVE: Colonic mucosa-associated Escherichia coli are increased in Crohn's
disease (CD) and colorectal cancer (CRC). They variously haemagglutinate, invade 
epithelial cell lines, replicate within macrophages, translocate across M
(microfold) cells and damage DNA. We investigated genes responsible for these
effects and their co-association in colonic mucosal isolates.
DESIGN: A fosmid library yielding 968 clones was prepared in E coli EPI300-T1
using DNA from a haemagglutinating CRC isolate, and resulting haemagglutinating
clones were 454-pyrosequenced. PCR screening was performed on 281 colonic E coli 
isolates from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (35 patients), CRC (21) and
controls (24; sporadic polyps or irritable bowel syndrome).
RESULTS: 454-Pyrosequencing of fosmids from the haemagglutinating clones (n=8)
identified the afimbrial adhesin afa-1 operon. Transfection of afa-1 into E coli 
K-12 predictably conferred diffuse adherence plus invasion of HEp-2 and I-407
epithelial cells, and upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor. E coli 
expressing afaC were common in CRC (14/21, p=0.0009) and CD (9/14, p=0.005) but
not ulcerative colitis (UC; 8/21) compared with controls (4/24). E coli
expressing both afaC and lpfA (relevant to M-cell translocation) were common in
CD (8/14, p=0.0019) and CRC (14/21, p=0.0001), but not UC (6/21) compared with
controls (2/24). E coli expressing both afaC and pks (genotoxic) were common in
CRC (11/21, p=0.0015) and UC (8/21, p=0.022), but not CD (4/14) compared with
controls (2/24). All isolates expressed dsbA and htrA relevant to
intra-macrophage replication, and 242/281 expressed fimH encoding type-1 fimbrial
adhesin.
CONCLUSIONS: IBD and CRC commonly have colonic mucosal E coli that express genes 
that confer properties relevant to pathogenesis including M-cell translocation,
angiogenesis and genotoxicity.

In this review we summarise the recent developments regarding the experimental
and clinical use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), focusing mainly on the
treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. Next to their relevance in the field of 
regenerative medicine and immunology, this population of cells has also raised
great expectations for possible applications in cancer therapy. While clinical
trials were able to demonstrate the efficacy of MSCs in cases of inflammatory
bowel disease and degenerative conditions of the liver, controversial results
have been presented regarding their antineoplastic potential in gastrointestinal 
tumours. MSCs can differentiate into a large variety of specialised cells. They
are capable of regulating both wound healing and immune responses through
paracrine and endocrine signalling. Moreover, MSCs can be transfected with a
great number of different therapeutic genes - considering their ability to
selectively migrate towards neoplastic tissues, this feature allows for targeted 
therapy of solid tumours. Transfected genes can be designed so that they are
expressed exclusively in the vicinity of the tumour, eventually triggering
apoptosis in cancer cells. In this review, we demonstrate the natural
distribution of exogenously applied MSCs in the host. Furthermore, we mention
various methods of tracking MSCs in vivo and different parameters of
administration that tend to influence therapeutic outcome (e.g., origin of MSCs, 
mode of application, or the potency of transfected genes). Finally, this review
points out the hazards of MSC therapy, emphasising the risks related to their
widespread clinical use.

OBJECTIVES: Interleukin (IL)-23 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of
ankylosing spondylitis (AS). The aim of the study was to clarify the mechanisms
underlying the increased IL-23 expression in the gut of AS patients.
METHODS: Consecutive gut biopsies from 30 HLA-B27(+) AS patients, 15 Crohn's
disease (CD) patients and 10 normal subjects were obtained. Evidence for HLA-B27 
misfolding was studied. Unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy were
assessed by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. The contribution of UPR and
autophagy in the regulation of IL-23 expression was evaluated in in vitro
experiments on isolated lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMCs).
RESULTS: Intracellular colocalisation of SYVN1 and FHCs but not a significant
overexpression of UPR genes was observed in the gut of AS patients. Conversely,
upregulation of the genes involved in the autophagy pathway was observed in the
gut of AS and CD patients. Immunohistochemistry showed an increased expression of
LC3II, ATG5 and ATG12 but not of SQSTM1 in the ileum of AS and CD patients. LC3II
was expressed among infiltrating mononuclear cells and epithelial cells
resembling Paneth cells (PC) and colocalised with ATG5 in AS and CD. Autophagy
but not UPR was required to modulate the expression of IL-23 in isolated LPMCs of
AS patients with chronic gut inflammation, CD patients and controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that HLA-B27 misfolding occurs in the gut of AS
patients and is accompanied by activation of autophagy rather than a UPR.
Autophagy appears to be associated with intestinal modulation of IL-23 in AS.
